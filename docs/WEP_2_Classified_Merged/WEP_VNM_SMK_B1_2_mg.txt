I will express my opinion on whether smoking should be banned in restaurants in different countries.I completely agree with the above viewpoint .Banning smoking in restaurants is a crucial measure to protect public health and create a healthy dining environment. When people smoke, cigarette smoke containing harmful substances like nicotine, carbon monoxide, and other carcinogenic chemicals spreads in the air, harming both smokers and those around them. Non-smokers who inhale secondhand smoke are at higher risk of respiratory diseases, cardiovascular issues, and cancer. Children and the elderly are particularly vulnerable to the effects of cigarette smoke. Prohibiting smoking in restaurants not only protects the health of customers but also the employees working there.A smoke-free environment will be cleaner and more comfortable, allowing diners to enjoy their meals without worrying about cigarette smoke. By creating smoke-free environments, countries can significantly reduce healthcare costs associated with smoking-related illnesses and improve overall air quality . Additionally, this policy encourages people to quit smoking, thereby reducing the smoking rate in the community. Banning smoking in restaurants is a necessary policy that should be enforced worldwide to protect human health and improve the quality of life.Smoking is very harmful to your health, so quit smoking to avoid affecting the good health of yourself and your family.Appreciate your health before cigarette smoke affects you.
"I strongly agree that smoking should be not allowed at all restaurants in the country. First and foremost, smoking poses significant health risks to both smokers and non-smokers. Secondhand smoke exposure can cause serious health issues, such as respiratory problems, heart disease, and even cancer. For instance, employees working in a smoking-permitted restaurant are at a higher risk of developing these health problems due to constant exposure. 

Moreover, banning smoking in restaurants creates a more pleasant dining environment for all customers. The smell of smoke can be unappetizing and bothersome, detracting from the overall dining experience. A family with children may avoid dining out if they know the restaurant allows smoking, thereby impacting the business negatively. By implementing a smoking ban, restaurants can attract a wider range of customers who appreciate a smoke-free environment.

Additionally, a smoking ban in restaurants promotes a healthier lifestyle and encourages smokers to reduce or quit smoking. Public policies that restrict smoking in certain areas have been shown to decrease smoking rates. Based on a large number of scientific research results, countries that have implemented smoking bans in public places have observed a decline in smoking prevalence among their populations.

In conclusion, completely banning smoking in all restaurants in the country is essential for protecting public health, enhancing the dining experience, and encouraging healthier habits. It is a necessary step towards creating a healthier and more enjoyable environment for everyone."
"In recent years, there are some concerns about the act of allowing people to smoke in restaurants, leading some ideas that it should be completely banned. In my opinion, there are some other ways to avoid the harmfulness of smoking to people in restaurants but do no need to ban it completely. 
On the one side, smoking is definitely harmful to human’s health, which can make it being considered not good for restaurant environments. For example, it can cause people suffering from many lung diseases, especially lung cancer, one of the most leading causes of deaths worldwide. Additionally, some people might have some types of immune disorders, making them sensitive to smoke and trigger many serious reactions in a smoking environment. Lastly, smoking in restaurants could put some significant risks of causing fires there, which is definitely not a good news for anyone.
On the other side, there are several ways to avoid the effects of smoking in restaurants, without banning it completely. For instance, the restaurants’ owners can change the way they design rooms for their restaurants, by making specific areas for people to come there and smoke. Additionally, there should be some fire alarming systems to control and reduce the impacts of fires that might possibly occur while someone smoke. 
In conclusion, in spite of the harmfulness of smoking to human health, there are still several ways to prevent it from affecting people in the restaurants. Therefore, I think there should be some policies and changes to the ways of managing restaurants and control smoking without even banning it completely.

"In today’s society, there is a social prejudice about the smoking in public areas such as restaurant, hotel…. Although some people suppose that it should be fully restricted to smoke in restaurant, the other still allow this activity. From my perspective, I agree that it should be limited but to a certain extent, and the following essay will state some reasons to support my viewpoint.
Regarding the health aspect of populations, smoking in the restaurants may detrimentally affect mental and physical well being. According to other research, our respiratory system can be damaged with the smoke from cigar, potentially people are more at risk of several illness, such as sore throat, asthma,....Particularly, restaurants may serve a range of customers from all ages, including the elderly, adults, and even babies in which some of they are allergic to the smoke. 
However, I’m more opposed to the opinion that it should completely eliminate smoking activities in those formal places. In some cases, restaurant may have a specific room for the smokers since it helps them to relieve their stress after a day of hard work. Besides, several eating places have been constructed in the opening atmosphere which not obviously affect surrounded customers. 
In conclusion, I concur that smoking in restaurant should be limited but not completely eradicated due to several reasons. Therefore, the restaurant should spend little spaces as smoking area to mitigate the effect of smoking on other customers. "
"Health-conscious is one of the most significant concerns nowadays when everything has been operated in a rapid pace of digital era. Some people opine that cigarettes industry should be eliminated to bring back a healthy world. However, I do not have the same idea for 3 main reasons.
To commence with, it is factual that a phenomenon just becomes detrimental it has been over-abused over a long period of time, not apart from the existence of addictants. The pristine purpose of producing cigarettes is as a stress reduction substance and that value of it has still continued till recent days. In fact, there is no survey saying that life expectancy of a person will be affected if they just take 2 or 3 cigarettes a month. What’s more, the right amount of usage will stimulate working efficiency and maintain stable emotion. Secondly, the action of banning a product is not as easy as saying, it is actually relevant to a whole industry and rate of employment. If this decision is made internationally valid, millions of citizens will lose their job, leading to the degradation of economy and the strike in protests on a large scale. Finally, it is psychologically true that putting restriction is incline to resulting in opposite consequences. For example, going along the street of Viet Nam, you can easily catch some banning signs of throwing rubbish at the corner of somewhere, but instead of the maintance of a clean and fresh area, they have a full of trash piling up like a mountain. 
To conclude, I totally on the other side of this argument. However, I do think that the government should issue some restrictions on the amount of using or legal places to smoke for a civilized and controlled community. "
"I totally agree with the idea of banning smoking at all the restaurants in the country. 
First of all, the action of smoking itself is a risk for many chronic cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases such as: hypertension, dyslipidemia, aortic coarctation, Chronic obstruction pneumonia disease that is known as COPD, pulmonary cancer, and some researches recently prove that children inactively smoke by living with a smoking person will have more risk of having wheezes, women can have a more dangerous gestation by actively smoking. Understanding of the disadvantages of smoking, it is everyone’s duty to prevent this action.
Secondly, restaurants are considered as public places, so if one smoke, everyone in the same room with him or her will be actively smoked, including children, women with the possibility of having a gestation, or people having pulmonary diseases. Inactive smoking is a real thing, the risk of developing chronic diseases from smoking is the same for the actively smoking and inactively smoking person. If all the restaurants in the country ban smoking, the restaurant will obviously have fresher and healthier air for everyone. 
Finally, it is a social’s duty to prevent smoking. The restriction of smoking in all restaurants will be a strong message for everyone to have more concern thoughts about the disadvantages of smoking, and inspire people to have more actions on preventing smoking in the future.  "
"In Vietnam, it is a common fact that smoking is harmful to people’s health. Thus, a mass majority of people reject the use of cigarettes in public places, for example, restaurants. In this essay, I will demonstrate an endorsement of the policy of total smoking restriction at all restaurants nationwide. 
Regarding health, smoking is the major reason for severe diseases, most typically lung cancer. Cigarettes consist of numerous components, including nicotine, a detrimental chemical that causes cancer. There have been reports on the increase in cases related to lung cancer throughout the world. This could result from the early use of cigarettes among youngsters. Therefore, the use of cigarettes should be moderated.
Cigarettes are not only harmful for smokers but also for individuals who accidentally inhale. Public places, such as restaurants, have a huge number of people gathering around. With only a sufficient amount of smoke escaping from the cigarettes could induce negative impacts to the crowd nearby. So, the act of completely banning smoking is highly necessary for the safety and the consolidation of public health. 
In short, I agree that smoking should be eliminated for the reasons mentioned above. By doing so, the world could witness a decrease in lung cancer, and community health would be ensured and protected."
"At the present, smoking is becoming a main problem happening all around the world. The majority of the store sell the tobacco. Whether smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants is a topic that generates significant debate. Here’s some opinion of the arguments on both sides:
On the first hand, exposure to secondhand smoke can cause serious health issues, including respiratory problems, heart disease, and cancer. Banning smoking in restaurants protects non-smokers, including children, pregnant women, and employees, from these risks.
On the second hand, restaurant staff are particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of secondhand smoke due to their prolonged exposure in the workplace. 
However, it consisted many personal freedom. Adults should have the right to choose whether to smoke or not. Some argue that as long as there are designated smoking areas that do not affect non-smokers, smoking should be allowed.
In conclusion, I personally agree that smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants. While it is important to consider personal freedom and business rights, these can be addressed through designated smoking areas outside of restaurants, ensuring that the indoor dining experience remains safe and enjoyable for everyone. The health and welfare of the general public should take consideration in order to protect the space green, properly and beautiful. "
"It is said that completely banning smoking in all restaurants in the country is necessary for many reasons. Such a ban would significantly enhance public health, make dining out more enjoyable, and keep up with modern health standards. So, I strongly agree with the above statement. 

Firstly, a no smoking environment is much better for health. Smoke from cigarette is harmful and can cause serious health problem like lung disease and heart issues. When smoking is allowed in restaurants, both customers and staff are faced with these dangers. By banning smoking, we would protect everyone from the harmful effects of smoke, leading to better public health.
Secondly, banning smoke would make dining out more pleasant. Restaurants should be enjoyable places to eat, but smoke can make it uncomfortable. It can affect the state of food, make the air unpleasant, and annoy customers. A no smoking restaurant would ensure a more enjoyable experience for everyone. For example, when I go to the restaurant, I want to have time with my friends, my family, but everyone can be disturbed by smoke. We have to choose a separate area, so we are not really enjoy this moment together. 
Finally, a nationwide smoking ban in restaurants would show that we are keeping up with how other places handle health. Many countries have already made this change to improve health standards. 
In summary, banning smoke in all restaurants would protect health, enhance the dining experience, and keep up with modern health standards."
"It is proposed that smoking should be prohibited from all the restaurants nationally. Personally, I am an advocate of this proposal for a number of reasons.

First of all, it is no doubt that the smoke of any kind of cigarettes is harmful to human. At the restaurants, there are many people of various ages including toddlers and young children. If smoking was allowed, it would be extremely harmful for the kids’ health. Not only that, many people including adults are allergic to the smoke of cigarettes. This can make them feel ill and sometimes even vomit inside the restaurants.

Second, the smoke of cigarettes can interfere the taste of the dishes in the restaurants. People go to the restaurants in order to enjoy the taste of delicious and nutritious dishes. If there is someone starting to smoke, the smoke can affect the taste of other guests’ dishes and even the atmosphere of the restaurants. 

Finally, smoking in a restaurant could sometimes cause fire. This is a rare situation; however, it still can happen. Therefore, it would cause a lot of damage for humans and possessions.

In conclusion, considering the all the above mentioned reasons, I believe that smoking of any kind should be completed prohibited at all the restaurants in the country. "
"Some people express their opinion that smoking is harmful, and it is important that smoking be banned at all restaurants in the country. I would argue that smoking should be banned, but such changes would be too radical.
Smoking is harmful not only to the smoker but also for the people around them.  For example, smoking in public releases smoke that affects the health of the smokers and causes other people who inhale the smoke to be sick. Other people who are of no business would be affected by the smoke. In many developed countries (e.g. Japan, the US), dining places either ban smoking altogether or establish separate spaces for smokers, as many people argue that it is unfair that non-smokers are indirectly harmed by the acts of smokers. It is imperative that smoking be banned in restaurants around the country. But, at the same time, those changes should take place in a step-by-step manner. The first thing that we should do is to actively campaign against smoking and raise awareness. Secondly, governments should introduce legislation that requires smoking to be banned in public places and set up smoking areas in public places. When public awareness of smoking is of an appropriate level, only then can governments ban smoking in public places, restaurants altogether. By employing a constructive approach to banning smoking, governments can ensure that the banning is well received and successfully implemented.
In conclusion, I am of the argument that smoking be banned in eateries and restaurants, for its detrimental effect to the smokers and the public, but the banning per se should be implemented constructively. While smokers are allowed to smoke, it is unfair that the act of smoking affects non-smokers. Thus, it is important to ban smoking constructively to protect the public from smoking."
"smoking is not should only band in restaurants, it have to be band in any place or area where 
have children or woman got pregnant. smoke can make bad health benefit for child and rely not good for baby. when young child watching a guys who smoke they will that cool and pregious that want to be a real man that mean we have to know how to smoke instead of how to act like a gentleman be cool with everyone not always pump the cigaret on lips 
because restaurant are precious space smoke just can go around not  go out. when smoke that can creative higher percent for accident fire that can kill people. the effect that come to people who not smoke is more than do it it can make some one innocent got  cancer. when you smoke that mean in your mouth have taste of cigar and you can not fell all the flavor of food it can be disgusting. smoke in that place can also make anoying for who hate smoke and they will not fell comfortable

"Nowadays, most people have a habit of smoking, and it is gradually rejuvenating to young people, not as middle-aged as before, most of them are dragged into these evils. I have also encountered cases where people casually smoke in public places and in restaurants and bars. This is not good at all, so I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.

Smoking in restaurants is not normal as people think, because the restaurant has all classes, everyone is at risk of infection with unnecessary problems with smoke, in addition to smoke. The drug affects more people inhaled more to the sucker, affecting the elderly, young children and pregnant women more than that. 

Smoking in restaurants causes loss of traditions and affects the reputation of that restaurant, so each restaurant needs its own measures to prevent this continued, can be banned or built. So a separate smoking room, but for me to build a separate smoking room is not optimal because they may not go there to breathe each other's smoke? So for me, it should be completely banned from smoking in restaurants, a luxurious, romantic space with candles and flowers that cannot let smoke destroy all. So each person has a unique point of view and no one is like anyone, maybe I think so, but some people think differently.

In short, everything has two opposing thoughts and it depends on how you think. But with this topic, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
"
"Some people believe that smoking at restaurants is not a problem, others think that is not good, but in my point of view, I totally agree with the above view. In this day and age, smoking is an alarming issue, because it not only affects the health of smokers, but smoke also has a significant impact on people around them. Therefore, smoking in the restaurant should be completely banned.

The restaurant is home to many people, smoking in the restaurant will affect many people, not only makes customers uncomfortable by smoke, but it also affects children and pregnant women when They come to the restaurant. Besides, it also seriously affects the experience of eating, other customers will feel unhappy when they are eating with the smell of toxic smoke. Completely banning smoking in the restaurant will protect the health of both customers and store staff, creating a clean and safe environment for everyone to experience eating here. That not only increases the economy of the restaurant but also creates a good reputation when there is protection to customer health.

I think the restaurant should have actions to protect the health of people, improve the message of non-smoking and create a clean and safe environment to the health of customers."
"Smoking is known as a harmful habit of many people in society. Banning smoking in restaurant has been a hot topic of discussion for many years. In my opinion, I agree with the reasons why smoking should be completely prohibited. 

To begin with, smoking should be banned due to its negative impact on health and environment, over dining experiences for restaurant's customers. Smoke contains many harmful chemicals that can cause serious diseases such as heart problems and lung cancer for human. Non-smokers, children and pregnant women, even restaurant staff that are exposed to these dangers when smoking is allowed in public place. In addition, the smell of cigarette smoke can be unpleasant for the dining experience for non-smokers. By banning smoking, restaurants would be fresher, more enjoyable environment leading to increased business and customer satisfaction.

Moreover, cigarette smoke not only affects human health but also contributes to the environmental pollution. Smoke lingers in the air, making it difficult to breathe and reduce the quality of atmosphere. Banning smoking sets a good example for younger generations by promoting clean air and healthy habits. Over time, such measures can lead to a decline in smoking-related diseases and pollution environment. 

The benefits of banning smoking in restaurant outweigh the drawbacks. Public health should be prioritized so people should be more aware of the harmful effects of smoking for individuals and society.   "
I strongly agree that Smoking must be banned at all the restaurant in the country. Firstly, smoking is not only harm the smoker but also people around them. This exposure can lead to serious health issues such as lung cancer, heart disease and other problems . It may harm people are non smoker like children and elderly. Secondly, a smoking ban can improve the dining experience. Restaurant is a place where people come to enjoy their meals and socialize. The appearance of smoke can be unpleasant and can spoil the taste of foods. A smoke-free environment ensures that all customers can enjoy their meals without discomfort. Moreover, banning smoking in restaurants can boost business. Many people avoid restaurants where smoking is allowed due to health concerns or personal preferences. A smoke-free restaurant can attract more customers, including families and health-conscious individuals, thereby increasing the revenue of restaurant. For example, in Viet Nam Many restaurant are not service the people using cigarettes in their restaurant and this enhance the number of healthy customers for their place. In conclusion, Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country for many reasons i have present. It necessary step to protect public health, enhance the dining experience, boost business.
"The debate surrounding smoking in public places, particularly in restaurants, has become increasingly relevant in recent years. I firmly agree that smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants across the country. This stance is supported by public health considerations, the need for a pleasant dining environment, and economic benefits for the hospitality industry.

First and foremost, the health risks associated with smoking are well-documented. Secondhand smoke poses a significant threat to non-smokers, particularly for children, pregnant women, and individuals with preexisting health conditions. According to the World Health Organization, there is no safe level of exposure to tobacco smoke, and it has been linked to numerous diseases, leading to organ failure and muscle related problems. By banning smoking in restaurants, we protect not only the health of customers but also that of restaurant staff, who may otherwise be subjected to harmful smoke during their shifts. 

In addition to health considerations, the atmosphere of a restaurant plays a crucial role in the dining experience. Many diners seek an enjoyable, pleasant environment when they choose to eat out. The smell of smoke can be off-putting and can diminish the overall enjoyment of a meal. A smoke-free environment allows customers to fully enjoy flavors of the food and drink. Moreover, families with children often avoid restaurants that permit smoking, which limits their options. By creating smoke-free dining spaces, restaurants can cater to a broader audience, enhancing customer satisfaction and encouraging repeat visits.

In conclusion, the complete ban on smoking in all restaurants is a necessary step for public health and enhancing the dining experience. As society becomes more health-conscious, it is imperative that we prioritize the well-being of individuals and communities. By eliminating smoking in restaurants, we can create a healthier, more enjoyable dining atmosphere that caters to the diverse needs of all patrons.

"Some people argue that it is not necessary to prohibit smoking in all the restaurants, while others believe that smoking should not be allowed in restaurants in their country. I am better convinced of the latter idea for the following reasons.

First of all, smoking is very dangerous for both smokers and non-smokers. When someone smokes in a restaurant, other people around them can breathe in the smoke, which is called secondhand smoke. This can cause many health problems like lung disease or heart problems. People go to restaurants to enjoy their meals, not to get sick.

Secondly, smoking makes the restaurant air smell bad. The smell of cigarettes can mix with the food and make it taste and smell worse. This can be very uncomfortable for non-smokers, especially children and old people. For example, if a family goes to a restaurant and someone smokes nearby, they may want to leave and never come back.

In conclusion, I believe smoking should be banned in all restaurants. This will protect people’s health and make restaurants cleaner and more enjoyable places for everyone."
"I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants nationwide. First and foremost, secondhand smoke poses serious health risks to both patrons and staff. Even brief exposure to tobacco smoke can trigger asthma attacks, exacerbate heart conditions, and increase the likelihood of respiratory infections. By eliminating smoking indoors, restaurants protect vulnerable individuals—children, pregnant women, and those with chronic illnesses—from involuntary exposure to toxic chemicals.
Secondly, a smoke‑free environment improves overall dining comfort and ambiance. Lingering odors of tobacco cling to upholstery, clothing, and hair, detracting from the pleasure of a shared meal. Non‑smoking guests may choose outdoor seating or avoid certain establishments altogether, leading to lost revenue. When all restaurants adopt a strict no‑smoking policy, patrons can dine peacefully without worrying about offensive smells or irritating smoke drifting across tables.
Moreover, banning smoking in restaurants encourages healthier lifestyles. Social settings often reinforce smoking norms—by removing this cue, we reduce temptation among occasional or social smokers. Over time, fewer opportunities to light up in public can support individuals who want to quit and lower overall smoking rates, generating long‑term public‑health benefits.
Undeniably, some smokers may feel inconvenienced. However, designated outdoor smoking areas away from entrances can accommodate their needs without compromising indoor air quality. On balance, the collective advantages—protecting health, enhancing customer satisfaction, and fostering a cleaner environment—far outweigh the drawbacks. A comprehensive ban on smoking in all restaurants is not only reasonable but essential for the well‑being of society as a whole."
"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. I think restaurants are places where people come to enjoy food and relax, so they should have a clean and comfortable environment for everyone.
First, smoking is not good for health, not only for smokers but also for people around them. Many people don’t like the smell of smoke when they are eating. Sometimes it even makes the food taste worse. Breathing in secondhand smoke can also be dangerous for children, old people, or anyone who has health problems.
Second, banning smoking helps create a nicer atmosphere. Imagine going to a restaurant to have a fun meal with friends, but the whole place smells bad because of cigarettes. If restaurants are clean and fresh, people will enjoy their time there more.
Of course, I understand that smokers may feel uncomfortable if they can’t smoke. But they can always go outside the restaurant to smoke if they want. That way, both smokers and non-smokers can feel okay, and nobody’s meal will be ruined by smoke.
In short, I think banning smoking at restaurants is a good idea. It makes the space better for everyone and helps protect people’s health at the same time."
"I strongly agree that smoking, including both traditional and electronic cigarettes, should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Smoking is not only harmful to the smokers themselves but also poses serious health risks to the people around them.
Second-hand smoke is extremely dangerous. Even when someone does not smoke, they can still suffer from the harmful effects of breathing in smoke in public spaces like restaurants. This is especially concerning for children, pregnant women, and people with respiratory conditions. I believe that restaurants should be places where everyone feels safe and comfortable—not places where people are forced to breathe in toxic air while trying to enjoy a meal.
I once witnessed a heartbreaking situation near my house. A man smoked constantly at home, even when his wife was pregnant. After she gave birth, the baby was diagnosed with health problems caused by constant exposure to cigarette smoke during pregnancy. Hearing about this made me deeply upset and more aware of how harmful smoking can be—not only to the smoker but to innocent people around them.
In conclusion, allowing smoking in restaurants threatens public health. To protect everyone—especially the most vulnerable—smoking should be fully banned in all restaurants. It is a necessary step towards a healthier and more responsible society."
"
I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Smoking in public places, especially where food is served, causes health problems and discomfort for many people. First, smoking affects everyone, not just the smoker. Second-hand smoke is dangerous and can cause serious health issues such as lung cancer, asthma, and heart disease. When people smoke in restaurants, other customers — including children and the elderly — are forced to breathe harmful chemicals. This is unfair and unsafe. Second, smoking ruins the dining experience. Most people go to restaurants to enjoy good food and spend quality time with friends or family. The smell of smoke can ruin the taste of food and make the environment unpleasant. In a smoke-free restaurant, the air is cleaner, and the atmosphere is more welcoming for all customers. Moreover, banning smoking protects restaurant staff. Waiters, chefs, and other workers spend many hours in the restaurant. If people are allowed to smoke inside, workers are exposed to smoke for a long time, which puts their health at risk. A smoke-free environment ensures a safer and healthier workplace. Some people argue that smokers have the right to smoke. However, that right should not harm others. They can smoke in private places without affecting public health. In conclusion, smoking should be banned in all restaurants to protect public health, improve the dining experience, and create a healthier environment for both customers and workers.

"Smoking problem is a hard problem to solve. In my opinion, i totally agree that smoking should be banned at all the restaurant in the country.
Firstly, smoking cause a very unpleasure place. When almost customers come to the restaurant to spend their time with people their love, having a people who smoke can make other customers feel uncomfortable with its smell. 
Secondly, if there are people who smoke, it is not only have effect on smoker but also people around them. The smoke's smell have badly effect on health such as lung cancer, so it is better to be banned smoking.
Finally, when the restaurant banned smoking, air quality is improved. And if the air is clean, customers can use their meal with the better mood, that cause good effect for restaurant. 
In conclusion, smoking should be banned at all the restaurant in the country. That would create a better health for another one, and also helps the restaurant have a plus point for customer, because most of people want to have a good place to enjoy their meal after a working day.

"I firmly think that smoking ought to be prohibited in all dining establishments. This is because it makes eating uncomfortable and endangers the health of others.

Health is the first explanation. Many people, including elderly people and children, visit restaurants with their families. Some clients might suffer from heart problems, allergies, or asthma. Smoke from nearby smokers may exacerbate these conditions. Secondhand smoke can have an impact on healthy individuals as well. Everyone is entitled to clean air, particularly in public settings like dining establishments.

The other big problem with smoking in restaurants is the awful smell and the overall atmosphere. As soon as one person lights up, the stale smoke drifts around and clings to everything. That odor drowns the aroma of freshly cooked meals and leaves patrons feeling uneasy. Diners come to unwind, savor good food, and shouldnt have to inhale unwanted fumes. An entirely smoke-free space simply smells cleaner, feels brighter, and welcomes everyone. Sure, some people argue that smokers should be free to light up wherever they please. Yet individual freedom cant come at the cost of public health for guests and staff alike. A sensible compromise is to set up comfortable smoking zones well away from doors and windows. That way smokers still have a place to indulge while most diners stay breathing easy. Banning cigarettes inside restaurants remains the best call for everyones wellbeing.

In short, the rule protects customers health, creates a nicer atmosphere, and keeps restaurants full and thriving."
"I completely agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants across the country. It’s not only harmful to smokers themselves, but also to people around them, especially in public indoor places like restaurants.

Firstly, smoking affects non-smokers through secondhand smoke. When someone smokes in a restaurant, other customers have to breathe in the smoke too, which is very uncomfortable and dangerous. People go to restaurants to enjoy food and relax, not to inhale smoke. For example, I once went to a restaurant where a man was smoking nearby, and the smell ruined the whole meal for me. I even had to leave early.

Secondly, banning smoking can create a cleaner and more healthy environment. It also helps protect children, pregnant women, and people with breathing problems who may visit restaurants. I think a restaurant should be a safe place for everyone, not just for smokers.

However, some people argue that smokers have the right to smoke. But I think personal freedom should not affect other people’s health. They can smoke outside if they want, but not in public eating places.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that smoking should not be allowed in restaurants. It is dangerous, annoying, and unhealthy for other people. Making a ban is the best way to protect public health and create a better eating experience for everyone."
"I disagree that Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.

I know that smoking is very harmful to us and people around us. But as I saw my father, he has smoked for many years and a day without smoking is not for him, he can feel uncomfortable, tired and the heart drops faster.
So if we go to a restaurant where smoking is completely banned, My father and me will not have a good experience. This will lead to the decrease of revenue of restaurants.
Not only him, the rate of smoking people is higher and higher day by day, and the rate of smoking people going to any restaurant in the country is very high. This can be terrible for any restaurant and for the economy of a country.

But smoking in the restaurant can be harmful to other people like I said below, so I think the restaurant can have a aera available for smoking and do not affect people in the restaurant. Or the country can decrease the quantity of cigarettes sold in the market so we can drop out the rate of people who start smoking. The design around the cigarettes has no affected to awareness of customer, be drop out the quantity of cigarettes is a good idea for me.
"
"From my perspective, smoking in public places, especially restaurants and food stores in my country should be prohibited. 
Firstly, smoking causes a number of diseases. This is because cigarettes contain a lot of toxic emissions. When someone is smoking, not only them but also the people around them could easily absorb that in the air and especially in a place that doesn't have open space like a restaurant. As a result, people in there at that time may affect when they breathe, which could bring the risk to their immune system. Moreover, the smell of cigarettes is heavy, which could make people at the food store feel frustrated, thereby bringing an annoying experience for them. As a result, the restaurant allowing smoking inside could lose their customers, and decrease the profit.
On the other hand, some people would agree that we should allow smoking inside the restaurant. This is related to human rights, that people have the right to do what they want legally, and smoking is not illegal. Moreover, a lot of open restaurants currently have a smoking area, which is convenient for those who can not bear not smoking for a couple of hours.
In conclusion, I still believe that banning smoking at all restaurants is the right way to enable people to maintain good health and not bother others.
"
I agree with the essay that "Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country". Smoking is bad for health, not just for the smoker but also for others around. Secondhand smoke can cause problems like cough, heart issues, and even cancer. By banning smoking in restaurants, we can keep people safe, especially kids, older people, and those with health issues who are more sensitive to smoke. Also, restaurants are places for people to enjoy food and talk with friends. When there is smoke, it can make people feel uncomfortable and ruin the meal. The smoke smell stays on clothes, food, and in the air, which makes customers not want to stay. Banning smoking will make the restaurant a better place to eat and keep everyone healthy. A smoking ban can also help smokers to stop or smoke less. Many places already ban smoking, so adding this rule to restaurants would show that smoking is not allowed in indoor public spaces. This will help lower smoking rates and create a healthier society. Therefore, I strongly agree with the idea of completely banning smoking in restaurants across the country.
"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are many reasons why this ban is necessary.
Firstly, smoking is harmful not only to smokers but also to people around them. Many people go to restaurants to enjoy food and relax after a hard working day.

"I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Smoking in public places, especially where people eat, is not only unpleasant but also harmful to others.
First, smoking is a serious health hazard. Secondhand smoke contains toxic chemicals that can harm non-smokers, including children and the elderly. When people smoke in restaurants, everyone nearby breathes in dangerous fumes. This puts the health of customers and restaurant staff at risk, even if they don’t smoke themselves.
Second, smoking ruins the dining experience. The smell of cigarette smoke can make food taste and smell worse. People go to restaurants to enjoy their meals in a clean and comfortable environment. Smoke in the air is not only unhealthy, but also disrespectful to those who do not smoke.
Furthermore, banning smoking can improve the image of restaurants. More families, young people, and health-conscious customers will feel welcome. In fact, many countries that have banned smoking in public places have seen positive results, including cleaner air, better public health, and happier customers.
Some might argue that smokers have a right to smoke, but personal freedom should not harm others. People can still smoke in private places, but public spaces like restaurants should be smoke-free zones.
In conclusion, banning smoking in all restaurants is the right thing to do. It protects health, improves the dining environment, and supports a cleaner, safer society."
"I agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country. Smoking is bad for people’s health, and it also makes the environment uncomfortable for others.
First, smoking is harmful not only to the smoker but also to people around them. In restaurants, many people sit close to each other. If someone smokes, the smoke can go to other tables. This is called secondhand smoke, and it can make people sick. Children, old people, and people with health problems can feel very bad if they breathe in the smoke.
Second, the smell of cigarettes can make the food taste worse. Many people go to restaurants to enjoy food and relax. If someone is smoking nearby, it is hard to enjoy the meal. Some people may even choose not to come back to the restaurant again. If all restaurants ban smoking, customers will feel more comfortable.
Also, a smoke-free restaurant looks cleaner and more modern. It gives a good image to customers. Workers in the restaurant also do not have to work in a place full of smoke, which is better for their health and safety.
In conclusion, smoking in restaurants should not be allowed. It is bad for health, makes the environment worse, and can cause problems for both customers and workers. A full ban will help everyone enjoy their meals in a clean and safe place."
"Smoking in restaurants is a pressing topic that has sparked much debate across the world. Some people are strongly against it, while others advocate for individual freedom and designated-smoking areas. In my opinion, both sides possess valid arguments.
On one hand, strong criticism of smoking at public places like restaurants originates from health risks, even with passive smoking. Scientific studies have justified the fact that exposure to smoking can lead to excruciating illness, namely lung diseases, respiratory problems and even cancer. Furthermore, some restaurants are constructed with close space, resulting in limited air circulation and making others susceptible to harmful smoke. Additionally, the implementation of a smoking ban in the public promotes a healthier lifestyle within the community. Being restricted with tobacco consumption will foster incentives of giving up smoking.
However, some argue that a blanket ban infringes on the rights of smokers. They might assert that adults should have the freedom to make personal choices, including smoking, as long as they do not directly harm others. Business owners instead should designate smoking areas to cater for the needs of smokers. Besides, another concern is that banning smoking may negatively affect restaurant businesses, especially a loss of customers and revenue. If smoking is entirely prohibited in these restaurants, smokers will choose other frequent establishments where smoking is still permitted.
In conclusion, while the implementation of prohibiting smoking at all the restaurants plays a vital role in safeguarding public health, a blanket ban seems not to be justified for some people. Thus, the separation of smoke and free-smoke environments is imperative to minimize damages.

"nowadays, smoking is becoming more and more popular in word day,including in Vietnam.it is widely debated whether smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.Personally ,I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Smoking in public places like restaurants not only affects the health of smokers, but it also harms non-smokers through secondhand smoke. This essay will provide some reasons and relevant example to support my arguments
Fist and foremost, it should be recognized  secondhand smoke is dangerous. Many scientific studies have shown that even brief exposure can cause serious health problems, such as asthma, heart disease, and cancer. When people smoke in restaurants, everyone around them—including children, the elderly, and staff—are forced to inhale toxic chemicals.This clearly demonstrates that smoking has a negative impact on healthy. A ban would protect public health and save lives.Banning smoking would improve the overall dining experience. Most customers do not enjoy the smell of smoke while eating. Smoke can ruin the taste of food and make the atmosphere unpleasant. A smoke-free environment is more welcoming, especially for families and people with health conditions.
Furthermore,  restaurant workers deserve a safe workplace. They spend long hours inside and cannot avoid the harmful effects of smoke if it is allowed. Banning smoking protects their rights and promotes fairness.

Such a ban would benefit both customers and workers, and it is a necessary step toward a healthier society.

"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Smoking is very bad for health. Not only the person who smoke gets sick, but also the people around them. If someone smokes in a restaurant, other people have to smell the smoke, and it can make them feel bad or even sick.
Restaurants are public places where people go to enjoy food and relax. If someone is smoking nearby, it can ruin the meal and make others feel uncomfortable. The smell of smoke can also stay on clothes and in the air for a long time, which is unpleasant for many people. Some people may even leave the restaurant early if there is too much smoke.
Also, no smoking makes restaurants more clean. No cigarette butts on the floor, and no bad smell in the air. It’s better for workers too, because they don’t have to stay in smoke all day. This helps them stay healthy and work better.
In conclusion, I believe smoking should not be allowed in any restaurant. It protects people’s health, makes the environment cleaner, and creates a better experience for all customers"
"I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. First of all, smoking creates a very uncomfortable environment for non-smokers. Many people go to restaurants to relax and enjoy their food but the smell of cigarette smoke can ruin their experience. It’s not fair for others to breathe in harmful smoke just because someone nearby is smoking.
Second of all, smoking is dangerous to health not just for smokers but also for those around them. Passive smoke can cause serious health problems such as lung cancer, asthma, and heart disease. Restaurants are public places where families and children also go so it is important to keep the air clean for everyone. Government should issue some resolution to prevent cigarette as levy high rate taxes on special goods, launch campaign in order to raise citizen’s awareness of smoking hazardous. 
Finally, banning smoking in restaurants can help reduce the number of smokers in general. If people cannot smoke in public, they may smoke less or even give up. This could lead to a healthier society. I believe smoking should not be allowed in any restaurant. Everyone deserves to enjoy their meal in a clean and smoke-free environment."
"Nowadays, smoking is a serious health problem in many countries. Some people believe that smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants. I agree with this idea because smoking in public places, especially restaurants, can harm others and create an unhealthy environment.
On the one hand, smoking could do harm to the other’s health. Firstly, smoking in restaurants is dangerous for non-smokers. To be specific, many people who go to restaurants do not smoke and they can be affected by second-hand smoke. Since smoke can cause health problems such as lung disease, especially for children, elderly people, and pregnant women. Secondly, smoking in restaurants can make the place smell bad and reduce the quality of the dining experience. The smell of smoke can mix with the smell of food and make it unpleasant for customers.
In addition, smoking offer some adverse image that cause impact to the restaurant. First of all, smoking in restaurants can hurt the restaurant’s reputation. For example, if a restaurant allows smoking, it may lose customers, especially families and people who are sensitive to smoke. The smell of smoke also makes the dining experience worse and can leave a bad impression. As a result, the restaurant may lose some customers. Secondly, smoking indoors is a fire risk. If someone smokes carelessly or throws away a cigarette that is still burning, it could cause a fire. Therefore, this is dangerous for both staff and guests, and it could destroy the restaurant and preventing this risk is very important for safety.
In conclusion, I believe that the government and some restaurants should implement the strict rules that completely banned the smoking in all restaurants. Furthermore, it also helps protect people’s health and creates a better space for everyone. "
I agree with the statement. Nobody wants to inhale someone else’s cigarette smoke while enjoying meals. Not only at restaurants, but smoking should also be banned in all public areas. It maybe is an essential part of someone’s life since it helps release stress, but not for everyone. For example, I personally hate cigarette smoke, not just on the emotional level, it also makes me feel dizzy and hard to breathe. Since many restaurants are enclosed space, cigarette smoke will be strapped inside and therefore cause more harm than outside. If there are air conditioners, it’s even worse, the smell won’t go away for a long time. Even if the restaurants have open space, the smoke will linger long enough for everyone in the area to inhale it unwillingly. And I haven't even mentioned cigarette smoke effects on health. Long-term smoking will harm a person inside-out. It affects the look, leads to cancer, heart disease, addiction, etc... To sum it up, smoking in restaurants will cause trouble for the staff and make others uncomfortable. It also harms not only the one who smokes but also everyone around. Therefore, smoking should be banned in public areas like restaurants. If somebody needs to smoke, do it in private.

Smoking is considered one of the most dangerous factors that cause millions of deaths in the world annually. There is a lot of research that finds smoking extremely harmful to human’s health. Hence, I agree that all the restaurants should have a regulation that bans smoking completely. In this essay, I will prove my point of view clearly.

Restaurants are places where people spend time together. The space of each table is quite small, and these areas are close, too. So, if someone smokes, people around can easily smell that. It significantly affects individuals who are enjoying their meals, especially in a small restaurant. This can make other customers feel frustrated and uncomfortable.

When it comes to health, we cannot deny the negative effects smoking brings. It causes diseases related to lungs. It not only harms to person who uses it directly but also affects the one who smells the smoke accidentally. As a result, there are a lot of people who pass away due to smoking directly and indirectly.

In conclusion, because of the huge profit of cigarettes for the economy, it is hard to stop businesses. However, we can declare rules or regulations for banning smoking in public, particularly in restaurants.
