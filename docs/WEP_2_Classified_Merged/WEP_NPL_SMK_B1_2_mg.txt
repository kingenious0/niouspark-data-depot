"Yes. I agree with the statement. Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. We all know that smoking is very injurious to health. It is the most bad habit of any person. Smoking leads a person to it's addiction. Then, a person cannot avoid cigarette in his/her life as smoking becomes a person's habit. Smoking is a biggest illusion in any person's life as he/she thinks that smoking gives pleasure to the mind and refresh their mood. But there is nothing happening such like that. Yes, smoking gives pleasure to mind but it is so short term pleasure which exists for short period of time. Smoking makes a person to spend more money on cigarettes which is not good for saving money. Smoking also makes a person's brain dull. In all ways, smoking is a bad habit of any person who smokes.

Knowing all the facts why smoking is bad for people is the reason for banning smoking at all restaurants in the country. Restaurants are public places where smoking should not be allowed. When a person smokes in such public places like restaurants can affect other people. It is not good to create problems for other people. Smoking in restaurants can affect children quickly as children learn anything quickly, they may imitate smoking. These are the strong reasons why I agree on banning smoking at all restaurants in the country."
"Yes, I firmly believe that smoking should be completely banned in all the restaurants across Nepal. Restaurants are public spaces where people of all ages come for eating, relaxing, socializing and enjoying time with friends and family. Allowing smoking in such environments not only harms public health but also creates discomfort and exposes innocent people to toxic substances. The harmful effects of smoking, both direct and through secondhand smoke, are well documented, and creating smoke-free environment in public spaces is crucial for public health. In Nepal- where tobacco use remain prevalent, banning smoking in restaurants will not only protect people from the dangers of smoking but also create a healthier and more comfortable environment for all.
Consider the story of Saanvi, a young woman who frequently visits a local restaurant in Kathmandu. Saanvi is a non-smoker who enjoys dining out with her friends/family. She often finds herself struggling with the discomfort of secondhand smoke, especially in restaurants where smoking is allowed in designated areas. Despite sitting far from the smoking areas, the smell of cigarettes often lingers in the air, making the dining experience unpleasant. They are forced to leave the restaurant before finishing their meal, not because of poor service or food- but because of secondhand smoke. For Saanvi, and many others like her, this is a daily struggle.
 Fortunately, the government is becoming more active in controlling tobacco use. In recent years, there have been many campaigns to increase awareness, and stricter enforcement for no-smoking zones has been promised. If implemented properly, a complete ban on smoking in restaurants would protect public health and promote a cleaner, more comfortable
environment for everyone, helping to attract more customers, especially families, and improve the overall cleanliness and reputation of restaurants.
"
"Smoking is a harmful habit that poses serious health risks not only to smokers but also to those exposed to secondhand smoke. Despite growing awareness of its dangers, many restaurants still allow smoking, endangering public health. To protect customers and employees, smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants across the country.
Secondhand smoke contains over 7,000 chemicals, hundreds of which are toxic and can cause cancer. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), secondhand smoke causes more than 1.2 million premature deaths annually worldwide. Non-smokers, including restaurant staff and diners, are forced to inhale these harmful chemicals, increasing their risk of lung disease, heart problems, and respiratory illnesses. A smoking ban in restaurants would significantly reduce these health hazards.
Many people, especially families with children, avoid restaurants that permit smoking due to the unpleasant smell and health concerns. Allowing smoking creates an uncomfortable environment and discourages non-smokers from visiting certain establishments. A complete ban would ensure that all customers, including children and elderly individuals, can enjoy their meals in a clean, smoke-free atmosphere.
Some argue that smoking bans hurt restaurant revenues, but studies show the opposite.  Instead, more non-smoking customers visited these establishments, improving business. Additionally, smoke-free environments reduce cleaning costs and lower the risk of fire hazards caused by cigarettes.
Governments have a duty to protect public health. Just as laws prohibit drunk driving and unsafe food handling, smoking in public dining areas should also be illegal. 
Banning smoking in all restaurants is a necessary step to safeguard public health, improve customer satisfaction, and support businesses. The dangers of secondhand smoke far outweigh any perceived benefits of allowing smoking in dining areas. By enforcing a complete ban, the country can promote a healthier, more enjoyable dining experience for everyone."
" At first I am disagree with statement of"SMOKING SHOULD BE COMPLETELY BANNED AT ALL RESTAURANTS IN THE COUNTRY "why only in the restaurant .BUT in my concept we all are living in 21st  century  as I know that all people are aware about side effect of consume smoking . they all know about the its injurious to health and these some product also game the declaimer about smoking

REASON OF DISAGREE

1 If we banned smoking it will impact negative toward the person than its bring mental problem and social problem .

2 In many country tobacco and smoking are playing major role in GDP if its banned we can see economical crisis

3 IN  context of Nepal due to share open broader to India where illegal smuggler activities will increase our money depart to another country than value of currency will fall down

4 Many people will lose there job due to shutdown industrial production of smoking

5 Raw material for smoking will wastes and  farmer will get huge loss

 In the scenario of banned smoking and implement of forceful law to band smoking will make conflict between government and  smoking consumer public. Smoking banded is not very fruitful for all we can work  from roots  not to consume smoking. Like we can work in spreading aware message , slowly government work on them to live healthy life style making them to busy in work. And depend on smoking production convert in another industrial .after many long periods it will give us positive and sustainable result to us .

"I believe that smoking should be completely banned in restaurants nationwide. If one person smokes in a room, it negatively impacts everyone present. People come to restaurants to enjoy their favorite dishes, go on a date, or host a business dinner. If one person lights a cigarette, it can disrupt everyone in the restaurant. The smoke not only negatively impacts the smokers, but also everyone else in the room.

Restaurants have customers with varying health conditions. Some suffer from asthma, as cigarette smoke is deadly and can cause immediate health problems. Employees can develop respiratory problems from constant exposure to smoke. Children also come to restaurants. They see supposedly successful people smoking and can be inspired by these smokers. While this is good news for cigarette manufacturers, it is also disastrous for children and their health.

If restaurants cannot ban smoking, they can at least create a special smoking area where smokers can smoke. This way, they do not directly negatively impact non-smokers in the restaurant. Even children do not see them smoking and there is no danger of being inspired by people with bad habits."
"Yes, I am strongly agreed with the topic of smoking should be completely banned at all restaurant in the country because, Smoking is injured to our health because this causes cancer, heart disease, lung cancer and so on. This impact in our health like breathing problem and problem in mental health. In the cigarette there is nicotine this led to the addiction to the youngster.
Smoking cigarette  not only affect our health but also affect our hearing and vision problem. This led the youngster in to a wrong direction and they become addicted to drugs. In the restaurant there is a family who came with the children. When children see people smoking cigarette and the smell of the cigarette is too bad. There is negative impact on children mind because children learn from what they see people doing. When they see people smoke cigarette and they went taste or try and this is the negative impact on children or teenager.              
Now a day smoking cigarette is common among youngster. Youngster consumed not only cigarette but alcohol, hookah and so on. This lead in to a wrong direction and they slowly become drugs addicted. This effect their health and the concept of people thinking of smoke men is negative. Not only youngster but also teenager is smoke cigarette and drink alcohol. When the time of study the teenagers becomes addicted to the cigarette and alcohol. This lead them in to a bad person and their future is in dark.
Smoking cigarette not only affect our health but also affect our future because the addiction of smoking slowly become the drugs addicted. That why we should banned smoking in the country . 
"
"This is a popular saying about health. Smoking should be completely prohibited from the whole world as it is the main reason for ruining the life of teenagers. People in the whole world mostly teenagers/youngsters are mostly addicted in smoking. They feel comfort while smoking. Therefore, they smoke just for pleasure and relaxation from their mental and physical stress, tension from family or job pressure and so on.
	Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants and public places because mostly people do not smoke at their houses. Their main center of smoking is restaurants and bars where they meet their friends and starts smoking, hiding from their families and relatives. If smoking will be banned on the restaurants and bars then the teenagers and the youngsters won't learn smoking as parents do not allow them to smoke at their home neither they smoke in front of their children. Also the teachers won't allow the students to smoke in schools or colleges.
	Smoking not only affects the life of people who smokes but it also affects the family members as he involves in different illegal activities like robbery if incase he doesn't have  enough money to buy cigarettes or drugs. Smoking also ruins his studies and career.
		To wrap up, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country for the betterment of the nation as the youngsters  are the future of the nation."
"Smoking in public places, particularly in restaurants, has long been a subject of debate. However, in the interest of public health and the overall dining experience, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. This policy would not only protect non-smokers from harmful secondhand smoke but also promote a cleaner and more pleasant environment for everyone.
First and foremost, secondhand smoke poses serious health risks. According to numerous health studies, exposure to secondhand smoke can cause respiratory problems, heart disease, and even cancer. In a restaurant setting, where families with children, elderly people, and individuals with health conditions gather, it is unacceptable to subject them to such dangers. A complete ban on smoking would ensure that diners can enjoy their meals without compromising their health.
Allowing smoking in restaurants negatively affects the atmosphere and cleanliness. The smell of smoke can linger in the air, cling to furniture, and spoil the aroma of food. It can ruin the overall dining experience for non-smokers and discourage them from returning. Restaurants that allow smoking may also face higher cleaning and maintenance costs, as smoke stains and odors require more effort to remove.
Moreover, banning smoking in restaurants aligns with global trends. Many countries have already implemented such bans and have seen positive outcomes, including better public health and increased business for restaurants. Non-smoking environments are generally more inclusive and welcoming, attracting a wider range of customers.
Smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants across the country. It is a necessary step to safeguard public health, enhance the dining experience, and support a cleaner, healthier society. The right to breathe clean air must take priority over the freedom to smoke in shared public spaces"
"Yes, I agree with this statement because, It is one of the harmful things that may harms our organs. Most of the people consume tobacco, drinking alcohol, smoking cigarates, drugs and many mores.

In our country Nepal people smoke cigarates every where that may occur many problems in surrounging. Also, people more smoke in restaurant, where people go restaurant to eat food but smoker also go their consume food and start smoking they don't thing that nearest people also suffer from the smoking smell. All the Restaurant owners should be sincerely for these problems and make strong rules to avoid smoking in their restaurant and sure to band this in areas. Make strong rules and that must be follow the customers If people break the rules make Punish.
Government also make effort to Solve this problem face by the customer that go restaurant to eat food. If people want to smoking then smoke closed area far from the people. If they smoking in open area may harm in public. Smoking cause difficulty in breath, lungs cancer and many more thousands of problems. We should make awareness program to band not only restaurant also the country. Make awareness program in Public are school, college   Public area etc. Also Avoid this thing far from the children. 
Smoking is one of the dangerous things they lost our health and wealth . So may careful for this dangerous things . If you consume it make sure to leave from now and tell your family friends circle to leave now . It may affect our whole life.
"
"As we know smoking is a cause of dangerous diseases and death. The harmful effects are known and the risks for smokers and though who are sitting near to them. So, I'm in favor of 'Smoking Should be Completely Banned at All the Restaurants in the country.' This step can protect public health and improve quality of life for everyone
 As we know smoking harms the smokers as well as nonsmokers. If a person smokes inside a restaurant, it won't only harm the person who smokes it also harm the workers who works in the restaurant and customers.  If any customer is pregnant smokes will affect that innocent unborn baby too. So, smoking increase patients of heart disease, cancer, and many unprevented diseases.
Furthermore, banning smoking in restaurants can create a more pleasant and healthier environment for everyone. A smoke-free environment would make having out ore enjoyable to the people. And people should not worry about the harmful effects of smoke.
Additionally, such a ban would give a good chance to the smokers quit smoking not only in public places also in their whole life. Which may help reduce smoking rates and diseases.
In conclusion, banning smoking in all restaurants in the country is the best step towards improving public health. It encourages healthy environment and healthier society.

"Smoking in restaurants should be totally stopped across the whole country. It's a simple way to make things better for everyone.
First, *it protects people's health*. When someone smokes, everyone around them breathes in that bad air. This can cause serious problems like asthma and even cancer, even if you don't smoke yourself. Restaurants should be places where people can eat and enjoy themselves without breathing in harmful smoke.
Second, *it makes things fair for workers*. People who work in restaurants have to be there for many hours. If smoking is allowed, they have no choice but to breathe in smoke all day. This isn't fair to their health. Banning smoking creates a healthier workplace for them.
Third, *most people don't smoke*. Why should the majority of people who want to eat in a clean air environment have to suffer because a few people want to smoke? Restaurants should cater to what most people want, and that's likely smoke-free air.
Finally, *it's a simple rule to follow*. A complete ban means there's no confusion about where you can and can't smoke. It makes it easier for everyone to understand and for restaurants to enforce.
In short, banning smoking in all restaurants is a clear and easy way to protect the health of customers and workers, and it's what most people would prefer. It's a change that would make eating out a healthier and more enjoyable experience for everyone in the country."
I slightly agree with this statement. Smoking is obviously injurious to health and it should not only be banned at all the restaurants but all over the world in my opinion. But, that is definitely something unexpected to happen right at the moment. Talking from the context of Nepal, the government should ban this but it is unlikely as cigarettes are loved by common people and are money source for the nation. In such a condition, applying bans at the restaurants or hotels wouldn't help. The main problem that I face is intensively due to people smoking in public areas like road, bus, parks, temples, etc., also guests at home. If I ever encounter myself with person who is smoking at a restaurant, I simply change my place or I change the restaurant. Now, the question is what if I don't get options to change my place and that's the only restaurant out there at that moment. And this is where I would like to request what if we modify the above mentioned statement to – smoking restaurants should be separately established. This way, we can solve our problems to a great extent rather than completely banning at all the restaurants, as if we apply bans at all the restaurants, people will start smoking openly even more than before. 
"Yes, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurant in the country. As we all know that smoking is injurious to health. It doesn't only effects the smokers it all also effects the people around the smokers.  Smoking in public places, especially on restaurant has been issue of all time. Smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants to protect health and maintain cleanliness around the environment.
  Smoking is harmful to non-smokers causing health issues like lung cancer, and respiratory diseases. It mainly effects children and elderly individuals causing serious health problems like asthma etc. so smoke free restaurant ensures healthy environment for all. The smell of smoke creates discomfort for the people eating in restaurants.  People come in restaurants for relaxation and enjoyment but in restaurant if there is toxic air than they can't enjoy and do relaxation. Smoking also pollutes the environment. People throw the cigarettes butts everywhere which pollutes surrounding and it increases the maintenance cost. 
In conclusion, banning smoking in all restaurants helps in maintaining public health , a better dinning experiences and a cleaner environment. Banning smoking helps to enjoy their meals without exposure to harmful smoking or in haling the toxic air. So banning Smoking creates a safer and more welcoming atmosphere for all customers.

"I completely agree that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. Restaurants are public places where people come to enjoy meals with family and friends. Allowing smoking in such places affects the health and comfort of others, especially non-smokers, children, and elderly people. Second-hand smoke is harmful and can cause serious health issues like asthma, cancer, and heart disease.

Moreover, banning smoking in restaurants helps create a cleaner and more pleasant environment. The smell of smoke can ruin the taste and aroma of food, and cigarette ashes can make the surroundings dirty. When smoking is banned, it encourages more families and health-conscious people to visit restaurants, which can actually increase business. Many countries have already implemented such bans and found positive results in both public health and customer satisfaction.

In conclusion, smoking in restaurants not only harms health but also disturbs the peaceful atmosphere that people seek while dining out. To protect public health and promote clean, welcoming dining spaces, smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants across the country. This step will lead to a healthier and happier society for everyone."
"Yes, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. One of the main reasons for banning smoking is to protect public health; it is so unfair to non-smokers who choose to live a healthy lifestyle. Smoking not only kills us but it also kills our climate.
Smoking in public places annoys and harms other innocent people. It is really annoying when you are with your family on a special occasion in a restaurant, ordering and having the deliciously looking meal and you smell the cigarette someone is smoking. Also people who do not smoke and only breathe smoke from cigarette take the same amount of chemicals as people who smoke. If smoking will be banned in restaurants, people will begin to smoke less, as they would need to go out to have a cigarette.
Smoking should be banned because it harms health, causes serious diseases and harm air pollution. Smoking can increase the risk of getting lung cancer; it affects the heart and blood circulation which is over time dangerous. If smoking is banned in all restaurants, it will help to improve people's health. Health is the most important thing for people. If you are healthy enough, you can do anything that you want to do."
"Smoking has become trend young generation as they think in this way that if one of his friend is smoking then he must also smoke to show his style and attitude that he can do anything and adopt the trending style. Today various people in young age are suffering from  cancer in different stages and various other health problems.
   Day by day number of restaurants are increasing in every town and village areas also.Owners are using different types of cigarettes for promoting their business.They have a clear and clever concept that customer would come to smoke as well as they will buy snacks too.But infact this is not a healthy concept as due to this concept people are lossing their health as well as wealth.Smoking is the fastest growing addiction today.Mostly youngster and old people are post smoke addicted people.According to different health researches smoking plays a vital role for developing mouth and lung cancer in people.Even non-smoker are affected by smokers.They too have a high chance of getting health realted problems.A member in a family is quite enough to deteriorate family health.
  Small children,Pregnant women,Old people,etc go to enjoy quality family time in resaturants.A restaurant with smoky environment worsens the family time and peopl's healthy silently.Restaurants are the publice place thatswhy those place should be clean and healthy.Good food,good service and good environment are the pilllars of Tourism Industry(resataurants).
  Smoking related problems are already on the peak.So it is must to eliminate smoking where people gather.No more smoking restaurants means quite less smoking problem.So say no to smoking restaurants.Lets contribute in creating smoke free society and nation."
"Smoking is public health concern, causing numerous diseases and harming nearly every organ in the body of people who directly consume it or indirectly inhale its smoke. As smoking increases the risk of lung cancer, heart diseases, respiratory illness, destroys life, career potential and cause mental retardation when consumed. So, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country.
Smoking indoors especially, in closed space like restaurant, heavily degrades the quality of the air that everyone in that space is forced to breath. Smoking bans contribute to a shift in social norms, making smoking less acceptable in public places. It helps youth be far from consuming toxic materials, influence of inhaling smoke for showoff as well as from peer pressure. A ban on smoking ensures a safer and healthier workplace for employees.
Moreover, it can influence the overall atmosphere of restaurants, making them more attractive to a broader range of customers which increase the overall image and revenue of the restaurant. It reduces health care costs and help nation build more responsible and energetic citizens. It enhances food safety i.e. smoking near food preparation areas poses a risk of contaminating food with ash, cigarette butts, and harmful bacteria.
To sum up, banning smoking in restaurants prioritizes the well- being of the boarder population. It creates a healthier, more comfortable and safer environment for everyone. It also protect right to breathe clean air. Adopting ban policy aligns with the global health initiatives and helps avoid legal issues."
"In my point of view, smoking should not be banned in the country because cigarette and tobacco companies provide jobs to thousands of people and contribute to the national economy.  When smoking will be banned, there may arise more issues than benefits. People will start smuggling tobacco products and illegal activities may arise. The people who are employed in tobacco companies may lose jobs and there may be gap in the spending of people. Government implies heavy taxes on tobacco products and this is one of the major sources of income for Nepalese Government. 

Although it may have health issues, it has very minimal impact compared to the health hazards caused by global warming, environmental degradation and pollutions. If government wants to control smoking, they can create awareness and should educate its citizens at the micro-level. Restaurants are the place for relaxation and people go there to get refreshed.  People smoke to get refreshed and relax and get some space from their hectic schedule. Health concerns are the individual perspective, and it combines overall lifestyle the person pursues. 

Generalizing the benefits and problems, I find smoking should not be banned. It creates employment, contributes to national income and offers a form of relaxation to people. Rather than banning, separate smoking zones can be established, so that it will not hamper the non smokers.  
"
"Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I totally agree with this because it protects public health and reduces environmental pollution and decreases smoking rates.
Smoking is very harmful to health. The smoke, which is exhaled by the smokers contains thousands of toxic chemicals which causes serious diseases like cancer, respiratory diseases, allergies etc. Doing this action, people do not smoke on public places or restaurants which leads to reduce the pollution on environment. It creates clean and fresh atmosphere. Smoking not only harms smokers but also affects non-smokers very badly. According to the research, smoke is equally harmful to non-smokers like how it affects the smokers. Daily exposure of smoking can cause immediate and long-term health problems especially in children and pregnant woman. So, making no-smoke zone results safe environment.
Nowadays, smoking becomes more casual. People do not hesitate to smoke on public places. This causes very bad effect on children and teenagers. They think that it is a fashion or culture and quickly attract towards it by seeing it. By banning smoking, children and teenagers get less exposure to smoking which can prevent them from taking up the habit. They grow up in a smoke-free environment. By seeing this action, other public places would restrict this. Due to this, smoking rates would decline over the time.
At last, smoking should be fully banned in all restaurants to create good environment and public health. For this, government and restaurant owners should make strict policies.
"
"I do agree that Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. As we all know smoking is not good for health and it can damaged our life but even after knowing all this people are consuming it on the regularly basis. Allowing smoking in restaurants negatively affects the atmosphere by making the air unpleasant, reducing the comfort etc. Many youngsters are consuming it to look cool and to impress the next person and many old age people become habitual about smoking. Smoking contributes to environmental pollution and unpleasant atmosphere in restaurants specially to child, pregnant women, old age person, and a person with asthma disease. Smoking poses serious health risks like respiratory problem, lungs problem, heart disease etc.   Many country have already started to banned smoking but then also every restaurants are not banning it to earn the money without knowing it can take the person life. Actually it's not only the mistake of restaurants but also a mistake of people who are consuming it, a government which are not making a strict rule about banning a smoking in public places. 
So, in my opinion Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants and all the public places in the country.  
"
"Smoking is harmful as we all know. In my point of view smoking must be banned at the restaurant in my country. Because people who smoke is not killing himself rather he is killing the another who is sitting nearby but not smoking.
As the time is going people do smoking due to friends influence, to get relief from various problems and tension the one is getting at the recent time for short time. Restaurant is the place where people enjoy food. Restaurant environment must be with pleasant dinning environment, must be protecting people's health. This must be completely banned in restaurants because if we do so then we can save the life of many individual who suffer from secondhand smoke, like people might suffer from respiratory problem, asthma, cancer etc. Smoking must be prohibited or banned in the restaurant to maintain the good dining environment in the restaurant and enjoy the environment and food. If we ban smoking in restaurants people can save the money and become financially stable which benefits their life. Doing this can help in controlling the pollution in the nation and maintain the natural beauty. Government must take serious action against it.
So, banning the smoking will help in developing various positive benefits which will benefit people like safeguard people's health, increasing the dinning experience and many more."
"Certainly, I agree with this statement because restaurant is the place where we go to have variety of cuisine. People go there to enjoy food and satisfy their hunger. Smoking in public places should be strictly prohibited because it not only hampers the active smokers rather it also affects the passive smokers too. Like customers and restaurants employees, etc. 
    In the context of Nepal, Nepal government discourages people to smoke in public places to maintain healthier environment. Moreover, about 90% of cigarette packets are designed by illustrating the picture of people suffered from mouth, tongue and oral cancer to make people alert about the diseases caused due to the consumption of cigarette so that, they would limit its consumption. Millions of people have lost their lives due to addiction of smoking. They are suffering from chronic diseases such as asthma, stroke and cancer.
   Mostly restaurants have become secret place for young generation to smoke privately which is not allowed publically in Nepal. Ill habits could also be cultivated for the purchase of cigar items. Youths who visit restaurants are addicted towards smoking. They are wasting their precious time involving themselves in smoking which is regarded as evil in Nepali society. People are fascinated to go to restaurants and get involved in smoking which ultimately kills their productive time, health and also resulting to the loss of wealth. For the sake of show off, adventurous purpose, imitation and as a fashion people consume it. 
     Nevertheless, smoking is injurious to our health. We should always say big 'NO' to smoking in restaurants and other public places to save our lives. Restaurants which are free from smoking can enhance smoke free atmosphere and maintain our respiratory health and everyone can enjoy their meal without harmful chemicals and toxic air.
   In conclusion, restaurants should focus on serving healthy, delicious recipe to allure the customers rather than permitting to smoke cigarette. 
"Smoking is defined as the act of burning a substance usually Tabacco, and inhaling the result smoke. It is injurious to health. it should be band in restaurants and as well country because they harm to our mental as well as physical health. i am totally agree with this statement. I will explain through   paragraph.

one of the most common problems we are facing in today's world which is many people are using this habit because of stress, personal issue and more on. in fact, some even begin showing it off. when someone smokes in restaurant they not onyx hurt themselves but everyone around them has problems. It also has many ill-effects on the human body. There are lots of demerits of smoking are: cancer, hearing loss, heart diseases, etc. but they do not stop smoking because they are addicted to the nicotine present in smoking million of people die each year as a result, so we can see how much this affects our society.

people view smoking as a way to relax, but it causes various health problems to themselves as well as others.  They should know about cause to their children if they smoke Infront of their children they learn very fast so, we should avoid such types of things and teach them good way of living. Therefore the governments ban the manufacture of such substance that cause great harm to the human beings and nature. Media must play the role to motivate the public awareness against smoking. All the public place has paste the signee board of ""NO SMOKING"" zones.
 
In conclusion i want to say that all the people should aware of smoking and make free from bad smoke be healthy and live a long and happy life. "
"Smoking in public places, particularly in restaurants, poses a serious threat to public health and comfort. In Nepal, where awareness about the harmful effects of smoking is growing, it is high time that the government strictly enforces a complete ban on smoking in all restaurants. This step is essential not only to protect non-smokers but also to promote a healthier environment for all citizens.

Restaurants are places where people go to relax, enjoy meals, and spend time with family and friends. However, when someone smokes in a restaurant, it pollutes the air and forces others to inhale toxic smoke. Second-hand smoke is known to cause respiratory problems, heart disease, and even cancer. Children, pregnant women, and the elderly are particularly vulnerable. It is unfair to expose them to such risks while they are simply trying to enjoy a meal.

Moreover, banning smoking in restaurants can contribute to a cleaner and more pleasant atmosphere. It can attract more customers, especially health-conscious people and tourists, thereby benefiting business owners in the long run. Many countries have already implemented such bans and have seen positive results in terms of public health and cleanliness.

In conclusion, a nationwide ban on smoking in restaurants in Nepal is necessary for the well-being of the people. It reflects a progressive step toward a smoke-free society. By protecting public health, encouraging better habits, and promoting a cleaner environment, such a law would be a wise and timely decision."
"Yes, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at restaurants in the country because it causes pollution on the environment and the health of the person who is smoking.  
Smoking cause lots of problem in the health of the person. It causes lung cancer and other disease which can take a life of the person.  Smoking is not only affecting the health of the person who consume it also affect the health of the person around them. Sometimes if in the family one-person smoke then there is high chance the family member is also infected with lungs cancer and other disease. In current period of time most of the teenager is addicted to the smoking and that habit damage their future they are suffer from lots of disease and some of the teenagers die due to smoking. In restaurants there is so e people who smoke but there are other people who don't like smoke that smoke can affects the health of another person who don't smoke. Smoking has lots of side effect some of them are; lung cancer, breathing problem, blood pressure, heart related problems, dental problem, fertility problem, and so on. There is no advantage of smoking people should know the harmful effect of smoking in their life. Most of the smoker know the side effect of smoking but they ignore it because they are addicted to smoking which cause lots of problem to the in current time or will cause in the future if they still continue to smoking. 
In conclusion smoking is very dangerous for everyone. Everybody needs to know that smoking can take their lives and can destroy their family and their life too. So everyone say no for smoking and say yes for healthy  life.

"Yes I totally agreed with this statement because smoking can kill many lives so if we banned this then nobody can kill by this. Those
who smoke knows everything but for the enjoyment of little time they smoke. If we go anywhere in the country like a restaurant
or some places then there will be a board by saying ""No Smoking"". Smoking is not a good thing to smoke around everywhere 
because it can affect people  and also  there should be strict actions in no smoking. And especially in the restaurants 
 smoking should be banned because people come to the restaurants to relax and to eat foods and drinks so it can. affect people who
came to the restaurants. Smoking can cause many dangerous diseases like lung cancer smoking directly affect lungs and kidney because of the unwanted smoke inhaled by the person. for example One of my friends father he used to smoke daily but he didn't 
notice about the bad side of smoking and kept smoking daily and suddenly one-day he started to cough by this his family members take him to the hospital and after the checkup doctor told them about his health he has been affected by lung cancer which is most 
dangerous diseases because it can affect people's lives as well as family's life also so people should think about themselves and also for family."
"Yes, I agree with this statement because it is necessary to band smoking in all restaurant of our country. The issue of smoking in restaurant has sparked debate for years. It is necessary to band smoking in all the restaurants is a necessary step toward ensuring public health, creating a clean environments, and promoting a healthier lifestyles. This measure protects of secondhand smoke and issue than poses severe health risks.
      Smoking in restaurants has long been a topic of heated discussion for a ban argue that such a measure is essential for public health that such a measure is essential for public health and enhancing the dinning experience, while opponents claim it infringes on personal freedom and could negatively impact businesses.
