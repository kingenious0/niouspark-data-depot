Cigarette smoke poses a severe threat to public health and safety, making it imperative to enforce a comprehensive ban on smoking in all restaurants throughout the country. By implementing this ban, we can protect the health of both smokers and non-smokers, promote a cleaner environment, and enhance the dining experience for everyone.

Firstly, secondhand smoke is a significant health hazard, as it contains numerous toxic chemicals that can lead to severe respiratory conditions, cardiovascular diseases, and even cancer. By prohibiting smoking in restaurants, we create a safe and healthy environment for non-smokers, employees, and customers alike. This measure also encourages smokers to reconsider their habit and choose healthier alternatives.

Furthermore, a smoking ban would improve the overall air quality within restaurants, ensuring a more pleasant dining experience for patrons. The unpleasant odor and smoke-related residue often associated with smoking can deter customers and compromise the reputation of establishments. A smoke-free environment promotes cleanliness, hygiene, and an enhanced dining atmosphere.

In conclusion, a complete ban on smoking in restaurants is essential to protect public health, provide a healthier environment for all, and enhance the overall dining experience. By implementing this ban, we take a proactive step towards creating a safer and more enjoyable atmosphere, ensuring the well-being of individuals and the success of restaurants across the country.
 
 yes, I agree,smoking is banned in all public places,like restuarant,bars etc   Law requires that all restaurants do not allow smoking For too long non smoking diners in our state have had to breathe in contaminated air from smokers. The law stated that there are no one who supposed to light a cigar,pipe or a cigarette on a cafe, restuarant or bar.smoking in bara and restaurant has been damage the taste of foods.If smoking is banned, it will promote a healthier lifestyle for everyone. Contrary to the belief that work hinders academic success, part-time employment can enhance students' focus, discipline, and motivation.

In conclusion, university students can greatly benefit from combining study and work. It provides practical experience, develops important skills, promotes financial independence, and enhances academic performance. While finding the right balance is essential, the advantages of studying and working simultaneously outweigh the challenges. With proper time management and dedication, students can achieve success both academically and professionally.
Smoking is a detrimental habit with severe consequences for one's health. It is widely recognized as a leading cause of preventable diseases and premature deaths. From respiratory problems to cardiovascular diseases and cancer, the harmful effects of smoking are undeniable. It is imperative that we understand the risks associated with smoking and take steps to promote healthier choices.
Firstly, smoking significantly increases the risk of lung cancer. The toxic chemicals present in cigarette smoke damage lung tissues and increase the likelihood of developing cancerous cells. It is estimated that around 85% of lung cancer cases are directly linked to smoking.
 
 
Yes we agree that smoking should be strictly banned in all places even in our surroundings also. There are various reasons to ban the smoking whether in restaurants or any other places because Smoking is injurious to health. The main cause of smoking is lung cancer. Active smokers also suffer from the other diseases like tuberculosis and heart problems. Smoking should be strictly banned in all places even in our surroundings also.

Smoking in an addiction that influence nonsmokers also. Peer and colleague group influences are very common in forming smoking habits. The ban of smoking is very necessary action to be taken.
As more and more people are aware of the importance of health many people in Hong Kong have suggested banning smoking in restaurants. 
 
                                                              
Smoking is quite common among the younger generations today. But it has detrimental health impacts on both the smoker and any other person that inhales the smoke.  Smoking not only impact on the smoker,  but also those who are neardy, therefore smoking should be banned.   it is major problem that causes many diseases .  it impact on the environment that polluted air. smoker. suffer from the many diseases like tuberculosis and heart problems. smoking is also a addiction that increases with time.  Not only smoker but also non- smoker also suffer many problem . due to this air become polluted , therefore, non- smoker breath in polluted air that harm them.  Smoking is mostly spread among the youngest even boys and girls both addicted to smoking. they spent plenty of time for smoking in public area . smoking also causes lung cancer. smoking should be banned in public areas to avoid such negative influences. 
                                Lastly, non-smokers feel very stressed when among smokers. It becomes difficult for pregnant women, senior citizens, and children, to adjust to an environment that is filled with cigarette smoke. It irritates non-smokers of various age groups. Smoking in public should be banned as it leads to annoyance to a large extent. 
 
 Yes , I agree smoking should be completely banned in country because it is very injurious to health .Smoking is not effects only that person who use it but it is also effects all the peoples who are near that person . Because of smoking we face many problems and decises. 
Smoking should be banned in not only restaurants it is also banned in all public places like bus stand ,railway station ,college etc.. The idea of banned smoking is very good . 
On the other hand, some people may argue that smoking should not be completely banned at restaurants. They may argue that smokers have the right to smoke and that banning smoking in restaurants is a violation of their personal freedom. Additionally, some may argue that restaurants should have the right to decide whether or not they allow smoking on their premises. Finally, some may argue that smokers are already limited in where they can smoke due to existing laws and regulations, and that banning smoking in restaurants would be an unnecessary restriction.

In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides of the issue, it is important to prioritize public health and safety over individual freedom. Therefore, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country to protect the health of both smokers and non-smokers and to ensure a pleasant dining experience for everyone. 
 Smoking must not be allowed in any country of the world due to its severe consequences on health, society, and the environment. The harmful effects of smoking are universal and transcend national boundaries, making it imperative for every nation to enforce a complete ban on smoking.

Firstly, prohibiting smoking globally would greatly reduce the burden of disease and mortality rates. Smoking is a major cause of preventable diseases, resulting in millions of deaths each year. By eliminating smoking, countries can significantly reduce the occurrence of lung cancer, heart disease, and other smoking-related illnesses. This would not only save countless lives but also alleviate the strain on healthcare systems, allowing resources to be allocated more effectively.

Secondly, a global smoking ban would contribute to a healthier and more harmonious society. Smoking not only harms the individual smoker but also affects those exposed to secondhand smoke. By eliminating smoking in public places and shared spaces, countries can create healthier environments for all citizens, ensuring that non-smokers are not subjected to the harmful effects of tobacco smoke.

Moreover, implementing a global ban on smoking would have positive environmental implications. Cigarette butts, one of the most common forms of litter, pollute land and water bodies, posing a threat to ecosystems and wildlife. By eradicating smoking, countries can significantly reduce litter and the release of toxic chemicals into the environment, promoting sustainability and protecting natural resources.

 
 The government should take strict actions to stop smoking in order to protect public health, reduce healthcare costs, and create a smoke-free society. Firstly, implementing stringent regulations and restrictions on smoking can help prevent the initiation of this harmful habit, particularly among young people. By imposing age restrictions, increasing taxes on tobacco products, and enforcing comprehensive advertising bans, governments can discourage individuals from starting to smoke in the first place.

Furthermore, the government should invest in comprehensive smoking cessation programs to support individuals who want to quit smoking. These programs can provide counseling, access to medications, and other resources to help smokers overcome their addiction. By offering these services free of charge or at affordable rates, the government can increase the chances of successful quitting and improve public health outcomes.

In addition to education and cessation programs, the government should enforce strict regulations on smoking in public spaces. Prohibiting smoking in indoor areas, parks, beaches, and other public venues not only protects non-smokers from secondhand smoke but also sends a clear message that smoking is not acceptable in society. Strict enforcement of these regulations through fines and penalties will further deter smokers from lighting up in prohibited areas.

Moreover, increasing public awareness campaigns about the dangers of smoking and the benefits of quitting can play a vital role in changing societal attitudes towards smoking. The government should invest in compelling advertising campaigns, public service announcements, and educational initiatives to educate the public about the harmful effects of smoking and the available resources for quitting.
 
 Yes, I am agree smoking should be completely banned all the restaurants in the country beacuse they spread many harmful diseases and with this human life is in danger and then impact very badly on the human health. Smoking is one of the cause for polluting air. So governance sjould gave to do some serious steps to ban smoking in all of the country.Smoking is injurious not only for you but for the people around you, so quit smoking not only for your sake but for the people you love.

Smoking is so dangerous that it can take any nation back from the path of development. Smoking is bad for health. It is important to give up bad habits like smoking.

"I fully endorse the concept of a nationwide smoking ban in all restaurants. A policy like this would dramatically improve  public health and the dining experience. It would limit secondhand smoke exposure, making restaurants safer for both customers and employees. A smoke free environment would also attract a larger consumer base, supporting corporating growth. This approach is consistent with the global trend towards healthier living and reflects a commitment to putting public well being ahead of personal choice. To summarize, a statewide prohibition on smoking in restaurants is an important step towards building a healthier, safer and more inclusive dining environment. Other from these advantages, a smoking ban in restaurants would be consistent with growing environmental health awareness and pollution reduction. Cigarette smoking not only hurts human health but also contributes to air pollution, affecting both indoor and outdoor air quality. Restaurants may contribute to a cleaner and healthier atmosphere for everyone by establishing a complete smoking ban. It is critical to resolve any concerns about individual liberty. Personal decisions are vital, but they should not jeopardise the well-being of others. A smoking ban protects the right of nonsmokers to breathe clean air while still allowing smokers to enjoy their habit in designated areas outside of restaurants. Finally, a nationwide smoking ban in restaurants is a step forward towards a safer and healthier society. A prohibition like this benefits everyone by protecting public health, attracting more customers, and promoting environmental well-being. This policy shows society's commitment to progress by reflecting an overall shift towards preferring collective benefit over personal preferences. Thank you very much.

Smoking nowadays has become a popular practice amongst the natives of India. It the most common issue of today's society. Besides knowing the fact that it is really harmful and effective for our health, especially internal organs, people continue this practice as they get addicted to it and it becomes difficult for them to cut off from this. Public places, such as restaurants, are allowing their customers to smoke in their restaurant so as they would increase the number of visitors to their restaurant. Some people are in favour of this statement, whereas, others are totally in contrast of it. I also believe that smoking should be banned in restaurants or public areas as it not only harm the smoker itself but also to the people they are surrounding to. Restaurant is a public as well as family suitable place. So, whenever families arrive with their children, the smoke would get spread in the whole hallway with the help of air conditioner as it would circulate it to the entire enclosed area. Children are more prone to catch this smoke more quickly then the elders. It would really damage their respiratory system. Therefore, these aforementioned reasons would justify my opinion on banning of smoking in restaurants or public places.
No i don't agree with this i disagree with tjis .no smoking is very harmful for our health. because i don't like it and in current time we see that are many people and in specially young age students take drink to much which is not good for there and there family also because when they drunk to much so they don't have any emotion and they also harm to other people and our family people also . they waste our money. they may causes very serious condition and at this time some people have not much money to doctors for our treatment so i totally disagree with this and i also tell there parents to see our children what they have to do in free time they have to see and also tell our children don't misuse with things and talk to those people who have drink and i appreciated with those people who goes to in every place in village to tell people they control our children because many people children in middle age they goes very serious condition so don't drink . 
Yes I totally agree with this statement because nowadays it become main problem in the world it spoil future of many individuals. First and foremost reason is that smoking can spoil future of young generation if any one involved in smoking it effect to youth education and future because in teenager age it is base of young generation  to take right decision for their future if any one involve jn this is spoil carrier of youth. Moreover, involvement in smoking effect on health nowadays   environment  effect by smoking due this many of pollution happened in  world  such as health issue created by smoking are it create disease like cancer, headache, and many more. Another reason is that it effect on economic condition in world because for smoking it need money to buy which can not afford by every one like middle people and poor people not to buy such type of drugs and smoking materials because they have  less wage  if their children involve in this type of activity  it effect to their future so this is reason I totally agree that smoking effect to person health and it should have to banned in India and all over the world

Smoking is a harmful habit that not only harms the smoker but also poses a significant threat to the health and safety of others. One of the most significant areas where smoking should be prohibited is in restaurants. I strongly believe that smoking should be banned in all restaurants. When people smoke in restaurants, it pollutes the air and makes it unhealthy for everyone, not just the smoker. The contaminated air can lead to health problems, particularly for non-smokers. This can cause severe health issues such as lung cancer and heart disease. Moreover, smoke can also cause respiratory problems, such as wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath, especially in children and people with pre-existing medical conditions. In addition to its harmful effects on people's health, smoking can also be a fire hazard. Carelessly discarded cigarette butts can easily start a fire, putting the lives of patrons and employees at risk. It is simply not fair that non-smokers should be at risk of getting sick due to someone else's smoking habit. Furthermore, smoking can worsen asthma and trigger asthma attacks, which can be life-threatening. Thus, prohibiting smoking in restaurants is vital to guarantee that everyone stays healthy and safe. By banning smoking in restaurants, we can ensure that the air is clean and healthy, and everyone can enjoy their meals without worrying about the potential health risks associated with smoke. It will also prevent fires that could be started by careless smokers.
Therefore, it is important to ban smoking in restaurants to keep everyone healthy and safe while enjoying their meals.

As more and more people are aware of the importance of health, many people in Hong Kong have suggested banning smoking in all eateries. They think that this proposal will bring about benefits on public health. However, some businessmen disagree with it as they think that it carries certain drawbacks on our economy. This has become a controversial issue.Firstly, smoking is injurious to health. The main cause of lung cancer is smoking tobacco. Active smokers also suffer from other diseases like tuberculosis and heart problems. The symptoms may take time to show up, but it eventually leads to a major crisis. It does not affect only the smoker but also the people around the smoker. Both active and passive smokers can fall ill, and this calls for huge support for a blanket ban on smoking in public places. By putting forth a ban of smoking in public places the government promotes a healthier lifestyle for everybody and it protects every citizen from many diseases and health risks such as cancer and other deadly diseases. Besides that, the ban will eliminate the bad example set fort by people smoking in the public. Children and teenagers will then have a mindset implemented by the government that smoking is bad. The ban will discourage non-smokers from starting to smoke, thus preventing them from getting addicted to cigarettes. Also, it will encourage smokers to quit, and aid them on the difficult journey to be freed from the bounds of addiction. Consequently there will be no cigarette buttes littered all over the place affecting the environment negatively‚  By prohibiting people from smoking in public the government is protecting the God given rights of its people to live a full and healthy life. Therefore, smoking should be banned in all public places.
"In my opinion, smoking in restaurants must be banned across the country in order to protect publics' health and to enhance the dining atmosphere.

One of the arguments in favor of this is the issues related to health. Second hand smoking is dangerous to both smoking and non smoking persons, and when a restaurants' policy does not include any rules against smoking, then everybody is in contact with these toxins. This can result to chronic conditions like respiratory and heart diseases, and some other health complications even to those individuals who do not smoke. But, in a smoke free restaurant there are no such conditions for anyone's health. Banning smoking in restaurant also improves the overall dining experience. Cigarette smoke contains overwhelming unpleasant odor, which is disturbing in the course of eating and relishing any other type of food. But when restaurants are smoke-free, a customer may savor their meal the way it was intended to be without being disturbed by smoke. The restaurant employees, regularly working in a smoky environment, go to work with high chances of inhaling smoke which results in health hazards. Any person at work should be safe and secure from everything that is harmful. So, if smoking inside the restaurant is prohibited, the employees would not be subjected to smoke.

In conclusion, banning smoking in restaurants is very important to protect the public health, to create a better dining atmosphere and to ensure that the workers have a safe working environment."
My personal perspective on banning smoking in all restaurants in the country is to agree, for the reasons we can analyse this  course of action in three perspectives, impact on general health, impact on Environment and impact on business. Impact on health, as everyone knows smoking is dangerous for health and causes cancer, what is less known is that smoking is not only dangerous for the person who is smoking but also to people around them.  When a person smokes out the air around him is polluted, and the people around them breathe the same air, this is called passive smoking. Passive smoking is harmful and affects the health of the individuals in the same manner as smoking over a longer period. So, while one can argue that their own health and how they care for it is their own choice, banning smoking in public areas like restaurants where children and families come to eat and enjoy is valid as it protects the non-smokers from the dangers of passive smoking. Fallowing the same logic, as smoking is banned in the restaurants, the air will have less pollutants in them, Leading to a better environment. Impact on business is two-fold, while I don't believe there will be much of a negative impact on the restaurant business as all restaurants in the country will fallow the same rule, so anyone who wants to eat in a restaurant will have to avoid smoking while in it and have no other options, but it might impact the cigarette making industry, that supports and provides the livelihood for a  lot of people negatively. As people aren't allowed to smoke in restaurants they may buy less cigarettes, decreasing the demand.
Smoking not only leads to health problems to the smoker but also causes for the people around them. I strongly suggest that smoking should be completely banned at restaurants in the country. First and foremost, it has been proven that Tobacco consists of carcinogenic components which causes serious health issues like lung diseases, anxiety and heart attacks, for those who inhale the smoke that is emitted from the tobacco. When a person smokes in public places like restaurants the near by people also inhale the smoke emitted from the smoker, which is not fair to impose upon other people. If required restaurants should have special places for smoking so it doesn't affect others. Allowing smoking may also lead to less business as customers are not interested to have dine smoke zone as it might spoil their appetite and feel uncomfortable, so the number of customers gradually decrease. Smoking also a high impact on environment as the amount of carbon and other toxic elements released into atmosphere is very high due to increase in number of smokers. In conclusion I suggest that smoking should be banned in restaurants as it leads to low business and I am on the side where people's health is more concern. 
I completely agree with the statement. Restaurants are the places where people go with their family or friends and stay longer by eating food to have a good time and fun. Smoking is the action which kills people who are not only smoking but just breathing the smoke by staying beside the smoking people. Smoking in those places leads non-smoking people also several health issues related to lungs and breathing and may causes deadly diseases like lung cancer which leads to death. Also smoking in restaurants damages the ambience because of the smell. If one person is smoking in a crowded area, he/she is causing problems for many other surrounding people, especially places like restaurants where the crowd stays for longer has major impact for more people including kids who will be affected faster. It is essential to ban smoking from all public places in general. Though if people are still demanding, then there should be designated smoking zones which are far enough from the public to prevent the public to inhale that smoke. But most small to medium scale restaurants don't have enough space to felicitating smoking zone maintaining enough distance from the crowd. So, banning smoking completely and making it a strict rule can save more lives. 
"I strongly agree with statement as smoking should be completely banned from restaurants or any public eating area. Smoking is something which can cause harm for a person, for the one who is smoking and for the one is breathing the same air. It effects internal body of a person which lead to many diseases, skin problems and ultimately death. Restaurants are a public areas, where different kind of people come to have their food. It is a area which is needed to be hygienic and healthy. Allowance of smoking in these areas can be uncomfortable for people and also dangerous to kids or sensitive heath persons. If not properly precautioned their can be heavy loss to surroundings and many. There are many public displays stating smoking is injurious to health which needs to be followed. Also, it a bad habit which is started due to anxiety and stress among people. A person's mind cannot be controlled but we should be able to at least stop making smoking legal in public areas like restaurants, parks etc. Compared to other places mainly restaurants, because that is a place that should be healthy and hygienic. I conclude this by requesting every heath care inspector and to every person who own restaurants to ban smoking and make a healthy environment around public.
 "
I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. There are several key reasons for this, including health risks, environmental impact, and business benefits. First, the health risks associated with smoking are well-known. Smoking causes a range of serious health problems, such as lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory issues. The smoke that non-smokers breathe in when they are near someone who is smoking is also dangerous. It can cause similar health problems in non-smokers, including children and especially pregnant women. By banning smoking in restaurants, we can protect the health of all customers and staff. Second, smoking has a negative impact on the environment. Cigarettes contain harmful chemicals that can contaminate soil and water. The litter created by cigarettes affects the environment and the cleanliness of the surroundings. Smoking also contributes to air pollution, which affects the quality of the air we breathe. By banning smoking in restaurants, we can reduce litter and improve air quality. Finally, banning smoking can be good for business. Many people prefer to eat in a smoke-free environment. Families with children and people with health concerns are more likely to visit restaurants where smoking is not allowed. This can increase the number of customers and improve the restaurant's reputation. In conclusion, banning smoking in restaurants is beneficial for health, the environment, and business.
I strongly do agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Firstly, we all know that it is very injurious to health as written on the pack itself so allowing it especially in public places like restaurants doesn't make any sense. People who don't smoke live longer than the ones who smoke. For many people who smoke, it might give them a temporary satisfaction and pleasure and in the process few become very addictive to it in but in the long run it is dangerous to their own health and life. There is also a chance of suffering from throat cancer which can cause due to smoking. The smoke which releases while smoking can cause a lot of inconvenience to other people in the restaurant by causing difficulty in breathing and it can mix with the food as well. To restaurants, not just adults but kids and older people also do come, students with their friends, families, etc. Seeing such activities can create a bad influence for kids and students  who are very young. It can also lead to a lot of trouble to older people and also to the people who suffer with breathing issues like asthma, etc. Therefore, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country.
Yes, I agree with the statement smoking should be completely banned in all the restaurants in the country. Smoking is one of the worst things I ever felt. I do not admire people having smoking habits. In recent years and research, we have seen the number of deaths caused by smoking, the government spends lots of money on advertisements to eradicate smoking but it still doesn't happen. A person who smokes not only deteriorates his health but also the health of people around him. The smell feels disgusting. People go to restaurants to hang out with their loved ones or to have a good time with their family or celebrate a special occasion. But people who smoke in restaurants make it really uncomfortable for the people present in the place and a sort of discomfort can be seen in them. Yes, I do agree that some people feel that it is a symbol of luxury or show in front of everyone but they might forget that it can also spoil the health of people around them, their kids or spouse. In restaurants parents visit with their children, seeing a person smoking in front of them may make the family uncomfortable and the children can have a negative impact on them. Sometimes there are possibilities of fire accidents also taking place. Thus, strict rules should be imposed by all restaurants keeping view of customer safety and comfort in order and implement strict No-Smoking rule. 
"Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country." I totally agree with the above statement because as we know now days in our country smoking is a new trend which is unlocked, actually the number of people who smoke are also increased. I recently saw the survey that people of age group 15-25 are more addicted to it. Here the main reason of this hike is that people are not aware about the side effects and if they know it is obvious that they will not follow and coming to restaurants they also do the same actually they allow smoking in there place instead of not allowing they made a separate room for smoking. I gone through a case where a minor boy who was smoking in the restaurant and instead of stopping or checking his ID proof the workers/waiters there was just watching and ignoring him actually in our country there is a rule to verify the ID proof just to check a he/she is underage or not if he/she is then they are not entertained with smoking and alcohol but restaurants are not implementing these rules and regulations just because they want to make money. At last, I would like to conclude that start implementing the rules and regulations or ban smoking in the restaurants.
"I believe that smoking should be banned in all restaurants across the country. The main reason for
this is the health risks associated with smoking. It is harmful and can cause serious health problems
for non-smokers who are exposed to it. It's unfair to put others' health at risk due to someone else's
smoking habits. By implementing a smoking ban in restaurants, we would create a more enjoyable
and healthier dining environment for everyone. A smoke-free restaurant would be a perfect place for families and children, offering a clean and pleasant atmosphere. Many people find the smell of smoke disturbing and irritating. A ban on
smoking would ensure that diners can enjoy their meals without being bothered about the smoke.
Moreover, this ban could also influence smokers by providing fewer opportunities to smoke while
eating out, and encouraging them to quit. A smoke-free environment would also contribute to a
healthier atmosphere for restaurant staff, who should not have to work in conditions that expose
them to harmful smoke. So, banning smoking in restaurants can ensure people's health, enhance the dining experience, and create a safer working environment for employees. This change is necessary, and it would benefit
everyone who is involved. It's a step toward a healthier and more enjoyable dining culture for everyone."
"            This essay is all about the ban of the smoking in the restaurants all our the world. Smoking releases a hazardous gas which is harmful to both the smokers and non-smokers, and it should be stopped at the restaurants.
            The secondhand  smoke is dangerous, when the someone smokes, the some the exhale and inhale mixes with the environment, this is called secondhand smoke. It results in the serious health problems like high risk of lung cancer,heart disease(heart attack), asthama and bronchitis. Childrens are at high risk for this when they inhale this it leads t asthama, ear infections,and high risk of sudden infant death syndrome(SIDS).smoke ruins the smell of the food and taste of the food making it unpleasant for many people. Banning it makes enjoyable for everyone.With the smell of the smoke the customers may feel uncomfortable and irritating environment . By banning the cigarettes the restaurants can appeal to wider range of customers. For many people, especially non-smokers, the presence of smoke in a restaurant creates an uncomfortable and even irritating environment. It can make the dining experience less relaxing and enjoyable. And we should encourage the people to quit smoking, especially for young people, seeing that smoking is not allowed in many public places can make it seem less appealing and less socially acceptable. This can help prevent them from starting to smoke. And by creating awareness like A nationwide ban sends a clear message from the government and public health organizations that smoking is harmful and that protecting people from secondhand smoke is a priority.
          Yes, I agree that it is important to ban smoking at all the restaurants, and it is our fundamental right to have free environment."
"Smoking is undeniably one of the leading causes of health issues and environmental degradation in India. While smoking bans have been implemented in several public places, including some restaurants, these restrictions are not uniformly enforced across the country. This inconsistency exposes both smokers and non-smokers to significant health risks. Non-smokers, including restaurant customers and employees, involuntarily inhale second-hand smoke, which can lead to severe respiratory ailments and increased susceptibility to lung and heart diseases.
The harmful chemicals in cigarettes not only affect the smoker but also contaminate the environment, contributing to air and land pollution. Cigarette butts, one of the most common forms of litter, release toxic chemicals into the soil and water, further damaging ecosystems. By banning smoking in all restaurants and public spaces, India could significantly reduce its pollution levels and protect public health.
Countries like the US, Singapore, and Malaysia have successfully implemented strict anti-smoking regulations, setting an example for India to follow. Such measures would not only reduce the nation's smoking-related mortality rates but also improve the overall quality of life. Enforcing the existing provisions of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA), 2003, with greater rigor could play a pivotal role in curbing smoking in public places.
Banning smoking in restaurants would create a cleaner and healthier dining experience for customers, free from the risks of second-hand smoke. It would also uphold the rights of restaurant workers under the Workers Protection Act, safeguarding their health and well-being. Ultimately, a nationwide smoking ban in restaurants would be a progressive step toward promoting a healthier, more sustainable environment."
"                                                                       Second hand smoke, a known carcinogen, contributes to thousands of preventable deaths each year. Within the confines of a restaurant, this danger becomes acutely concentrated, exposing both staff and patrons to a cocktail of harmful chemicals. To protect the health of our citizens, and to ensure equal access to clean air, a complete and national ban on smoking within all restaurants is absolutely necessary. In the ongoing discourse surrounding public health and individual liberties, the issue of smoking in restaurants remains a critical point of contention. While some argue for the preservation of personal choice, the overwhelming evidence underscores the necessity of a complete nationwide ban on smoking in all restaurants. Such a measure is not merely a matter of preference but a fundamental step towards safeguarding public health, ensuring the comfort of all citizens, and fostering a healthier societal environment.
 The most compelling argument for a smoking ban lies in the irrefutable evidence of the detrimental effects of secondhand smoke. Scientific consensus confirms that exposure to secondhand smoke poses significant health risks, including respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular disease, and various forms of cancer. In the confined spaces of restaurants, both employees and patrons are subjected to this toxic environment, often without the ability to avoid it. This involuntary exposure violates the fundamental right to a safe and healthy environment, particularly for vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, and individuals with pre-existing health conditions.
 A complete nationwide ban on smoking in all restaurants is an imperative public health measure. The overwhelming evidence of the harmful effects of secondhand smoke, the need to create a healthier environment, and the fundamental rights of non-smokers necessitate this policy."
Yes, I agree with the given statement SMOKING  SHOULD BE COMPLETELY BANNED AT ALL RESTAURENTS IN THE COUNTRY. Because of smoking in the restaurants the people around them also cause some health problems .The diseases may be respiratory and heart problems.  If Smoking is done more at the restaurant area may also cause pollution surrounding to that restaurant. We can improve the dining area by banning smoking in the restaurants. The people who does not smoke can feel free to eat without any hesitation. The people can enjoy their meal with their families and friends.  This creates environment free from pollution and harmful smoke. The employees in the restaurant can work actively in the surroundings. This creates healthier atmosphere in the restaurant. By doing this the owners of the restaurant can increase their customers. Customer traffic increases in the restaurant due to no smoking board in the surroundings. This creates economic befits for business. It can reduce the work stress to the workers. In order to clean the stains in the restaurants. The owners   can  maintain  the restaurant without stains. In the restaurant  the atmosphere is free from bad odour. SMOKING SHOULD BE COMPLETELY BANNED  AT  ALL THE RESTAURANTS IN THE COUNTRY due to this can create the atmosphere free from bad air pollution in the restaurant. The people can have their meal comfortable in the restaurant. This should be implemented in all the countries to make people to have a comfortable meal within the restaurant. By above advantages are helpful to people in the restaurant . 
"Smoking in restaurants has a significant health threat to both smokers and non smokers alike. Due to this i strongly agree that smoking must be banned in all restaurants across the country. In some cases a single cigar causes a huge accidents in the kitchen leading to sacrifices to human life’s and property loses.
                                         The primary reason is the stance for public health and smoke contains numerous toxic chemicals, which increases the chances to get seriously ill (like respiratory problems, cancer, heart diseases etc..) for people who are exposed to the smoke. In the dining area of the restaurants people basically gather to eat and socialize, but the smock spreads bad odour across the restaurant endangering not only the smoker but also including non smokers and staff and any other.
                                     For this reason smoking ban promotes a healthier life style and encourages smokers to quit their habit of smoking to contributing to improve an ideal society. It also creates a more pleasant dining experience for non smokers who can enjoy their meals without any interruptions and dis comfort.
                                                          Some people argue that a ban destroys and interrupts individuality and freedom. However the right to smoke shouldn’t prioritize over the right to breath clean air.
                                               In conclusion, a nationwide smoking ban in restaurants is a very crucial step which leads towards safeguarding public health and promoting a healthier environment. While individual freedom of people is important, they must be balanced with need to protect them well being of the entire community as well.   "
"Introduction: Yes, I agree to the statement because the issue of smoking in public spaces, particularly restaurants, has been for a long time. While some believe smokers should have designated areas, the health risks associated with second hand smoke far outweigh personal choices. A complete smoking ban in all restaurants across the country is necessary to protect public health, enhance the dining experience, and safeguard restaurant employees.
One of the main reasons for prohibiting smoking in restaurants is the harmful effects of second-hand smoke. Many of them are suffering from smoke which are realised by some other persons Studies have shown that exposure to tobacco smoke increases the likelihood of respiratory issues, heart disease, and cancer. Many individuals, including children, pregnant women, and those with pre-existing health conditions, are especially at risk. A nationwide smoking ban would help minimize these dangers and promote a healthier environment for everyone.
A smoke-free environment significantly improves the overall dining experience. The smell of tobacco can interfere with the enjoyment of food, and the smoke can make the atmosphere unpleasant. Additionally, smoke tends to settle into furniture and fabrics, creating an undesirable odour. Banning smoking entirely creates a cleaner and more enjoyable space for all customers.
Conclusion: Many of the customers are suffering due to smoke smell a comprehensive smoking ban in restaurants is required for public health, employee safety, and business growth. Implementing this policy nationwide will lead to cleaner, healthier, and more enjoyable dining spaces for all people."
"Banning smoking in restaurants protest the health of non smoker ,crerats a more plesant dining experience and sets a positive vibes for children which also potentially boosting restaurants business by smoke free environment.
 Smoking should be banned for our health and safety in our daily life:
*secondhand and smoke risks: it is also known as environmental tobacco smoke, It contains harmful chemicals that can cause or worsen various respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.
* no safe level of smke exposer: Scientific evidence consistently demonstrates that there is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke, meaning even brief exposure can be detrimental. 
*  procting vulnerable populations: Children, pregnant women, and individual people with pre-existing respiratory or heart conditions are particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of secondhand smoke. 
 In restaurants we need to force on food.by banning smoking we can also increase restaurants business also it sets social amd enthical consiseration .it sets a positive vides for childrens and the non smokers.respect for others and also the public health.by smoking you attreact serious health issues like asthma , bronchitis,cancers,etc. it can cause more problems for children .ear infections and increases the sudden infants dath syndrome. Somking  ruins food smell and taste.cigarette is strong smoke makes food unpleasant over power
      Banning smoking in restaurants is a public health measure that can contribute to a healthier society. Banning smoking in restaurants respects the rights of non-smokers to breathe clean air and enjoy a comfortable dining experience."
"Yes , I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
Smoking In restaurant areas not only effect the person who is smoking but also affect the people nearby. It causes respiratory problems for the people who are respiring the smoke. If this continues it also effect the sorrounding areas(air pollution). So we should ban smokng In restaurant areas.
By banning smoking in  restaurants we can improve dining experience in the restaurants. So this makes more people to visit the restaurant. As smoking is banned it gives a good and healthier environment for people. It also increases the economic benefits for the business.
Not only in restaurats but also it shoulb be banned in all living areas. So that the living organisms like humans,animals ,birds etc will not be effected. So that all maintaince costs like cleaning can be reduced.  The people who visited restaurant will enjoy the food if the smoking is banned.Smoking banned in restaurant will have great number of customers as the place is secured from hazardous gases present in a smoke.
It is important to ban smoking in restaurants. Because of this a lot of air pollution is reduced in the environment . This successfully implemented in some countries . So this should also be implemented in remaining countries to be have a good environment and nature."
"I strongly agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants across the country.  To begin with, the adverse health effects of secondhand smoke are documented. The World Health Organization has recognized secondhand smoke as an enemy to health pertaining to several diseases, among them cancer, respiratory infections, and heart disease. Thus, whenever a restaurant permits smoking, the patrons who are non-smokers expose themselves to the harmful effects of secondhand smoke, causing harmful effects in themselves, and, thus, a complete ban would save the health of these non-smokers and restaurant staff in the process of barring smoking altogether, conserving a safer environment.
 Many people would prefer to eat in a clean and nice environment. Smoke can stay in the air and on clothing, detracting from what should otherwise be an enjoyable dining experience. As an example, where restaurants have a smoking area, the smoke usually drifts into the non-smoking sections, leaving the non-smokers in discomfort and searching for other dining places. Having a policy of no smoking would ensure a larger clientele, for families and those conscious of health mostly do not patronize restaurants that do not support their comfort and well-being. 
In addition, several countries have successfully implemented smoking bans in public places like restaurants and enjoyed the fruits of such interventions. Following these bans, countries such as Australia and the UK have noticed a significant reduction in smoking prevalence as well as improvements in the health of the general public. This indicates that a nationwide ban on restaurant smoking should render benefit in the long run to society. In short, a restaurant smoke ban is a much-needed intervention toward the protection of public health, dining comfort, and wellness at large. "
"Smoking is one of the major reasons of death rates in India.Smoking has wide range of health issues.Smoking is banned at many of the restaurants but not all.Smoking not only effects the person who is smoking but also the person around him in the restaurant.Banning of smoking in all the restaurants helps to create and cleaner environment.
Cigarettes have thousands of harmful chemical compounds that affects the human body in dangerous ways.Smoking causes  cancer(lung cancer and mouth cancer),respiratory diseases like lung failure,damage of wind pipe etc.Smokers are not only getting into risk by this but also making the people around them to suffer.Allowing smoking at the restaurants force the people to inhale that harmful smoke.Consumption of tobacco should be widely reduce.US,Singapore, Malaysia strictly follow the rules to not smoke in public places.By following the same rules India’s death rate can be reduce to a wide range.According to COTPA consumption of tobacco and products act ,2003 smoking is public places is restricted but not strictly followed.On other hand cigarette butts also causes a lot of pollution.
Smoking increases health risks to costumers.Banning smoking in restaurants enable better dining.According to workers protection act the workers of the restaurants should not suffer.Banning it has a lot of environmental benefits and increases overall quality of life."
"Smoking in all restaurants of the country should be prohibited completely. It fairly states that smoking is harmful to public health and uncomfortable for non-smokers. It also spoils a good dining experience.
Firstly, health risks caused by smoking are well documented. Secondhand smoke proves to result in life-threatening diseases, especially in non-smokers, ranging from respiratory ailments to cardiovascular diseases. According to CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S), about 41,000 deaths among adult non-smokers are attributable to secondhand smoke exposure yearly. Restaurants would be places of leisure and fun, yet sourly ruined by smoky air that could turn even these places into health hazards, especially for children, the pregnant, and the sick.

Moreover, smoking brings forth great discomfort in many customers who would otherwise enjoy being in restaurants. Most people dine outside because they want a pleasant atmosphere. The smell from the smoke would then end up behind clothes and hair, thus ruining someone's experience. Many restaurants realize that by adopting a no-smoking establishment, they can attract more custom because of the appeal of a smoke-free environment. For instance, when New York City began implementing an extended smoking ban in restaurants in 2003, studies conducted by the city soon after indicated a rise in restaurant business because of diners who deliberately sought out those places because of less concern for their health and comfort.

Thus, it is a complete ban on smoking within the premises of a restaurant that makes it a health necessity and also a basic positive initiative toward a more relaxing atmosphere while dining. Such a ban protects and promotes health for patrons while improving the overall experience, therefore benefiting both the public and the restaurant industry in shaping a culture of health and wellbeing across the nation."
"As we all are quite familiar with the phrase- ‘Smoking is injurious to health’. It is true.
Coming to smoking in restaurants, I believe that it should be banned due to multiple reasons. Smoking causes a foul smell that leads to the entire air surrounding to smell foul. People visit restaurants to eat tasty food and if people smoke, it affects the taste, which defeats the whole purpose of spending money to eat outside. Not only that but it also causes harm to the environment.

It not only affects the environment by decreasing the air quality levels but also causes deep harm to the smoker and the people around inhaling this air. Passive smoking is often sidelined but it is also a major concern as it effects the passive smokers- that is, people inhaling the air by causing asthma and breathing and lung problems.

Cigarettes contain tobacco and nicotine which are often addictive and can also influence passive smokers to pick up the habit. Cigarettes can easily cause heart and lung problems leading to cancer.

Therefore, banning in restaurants can help in maintaining a cleaner environment, reduce health risks and overall maintain a healthier society.  It can   also encourage smokers to quit and also avoid the impoliteness the non-smokers feel while eating outside in a restaurant."
"Smoking Should be Completely Banned from All Restaurants Nationwide.
Smoking remains a significant public health issue, particularly in public places like restaurants. Secondhand smoke has long-established negative consequences, so the argument for banning smoking in all restaurants is strongly in favor.
Secondhand smoke contains a combination of hazardous chemicals, many of which are carcinogens. Individuals who are exposed to secondhand smoke in restaurants increase their risk of developing lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory disease. Children and susceptible people are especially at risk. Prohibiting smoking in restaurants would serve the public's health by closing the door to this dangerous exposure.
Smoking prohibition would be beneficial to the restaurant business economically. Contrary to some views, non-smokers are more likely to dine at smoke-free restaurants. Research has shown that smoke-free restaurants capture a wider audience, including families and individuals suffering from respiratory illnesses. Furthermore, smoking has a significant health expense, and its prohibition would suppress healthcare costs.
Smoking also negatively impacts the dining experience. The cigarette smoke aftertaste can ruin the atmosphere, making individuals feel uneasy. Having a smoke-free dining area would be more enjoyable for everyone, inviting more individuals to come and relish their meal.Secondly, smoking results in environmental contamination. Littering cigarette butts in public dining areas contributes to littering and environmental deterioration. A national ban would remove cigarette litter and air pollution.
CONCLUSION:-
Complete smoking ban in restaurants matters to the public health, economy, and environment. Implementing this ban would be a significant step toward a cleaner and healthier future for all citizens."
"Smoking in restaurants will cause more serious health risks to non smokers and smoking will disturbs The dinning experience for customers.  Banning the cigaratte smoking will protect public ,enhance comfort and reduces the environmental harm.
Cigarette smoking causes the risk of lung cancer,heart disease and respiratory illness.it is danger that restaurant staff and all will exposed to danger.  Banning the smoking in restaurants will be complete safer for our environment.

Banning smoking in all the resturants in the country is essential for public health and environmental well being.A  nation wide prohibition would lead to healthier and more enjoyable dinning experience for customers and as well as all the staff people."
Yes I agree that smoking should be banned completely at all the restaurants in the country. As of now this is the major problem going out across the country. Here we can see the people smoking near the bus stops and near the schools / colleges and near any markets ,so this can create a disturbance for the people around them. Smoking causes others to smoke just only by breathing the air. I say that government should take a appropriate action to stop selling of tobacco.  Smoking not only causes cancer but it might take peoples life sometimes. Tobacco usage must be lowered and control as soon as possible as it can create a bad impact in the present environment  , which can cause global warming and can pollute the air in many ways . As we live on the earth its our responsibility to save it from  polluting . It does not only kills the people it will make a dangerous impact on the persons organs . So as to save our living hood in the earth we should take a serious steps to control the consumption o f tobacco and continue the living cycle on the earth .
I strongly agree with the fact that smoking should be completely banned in all of the restaurants across the country. Firstly smoking is so much harmful  for your health as it may cause many lung diseases. It may even lead to death. And smoking in a public restaurant may not only harm you but also it may cause an effect to the people who are around you as they breathe in the same air which is polluted because of the harmful smoke released through the cigarettes.  Restaurants are visited by many kinds of people like children, adults , and also old aged people who might have serious health issues. There may even be people with asthma and other breathing problems. If they breathe in the bad smoke they might face serious illness situations. It might spoil their entire health. And the bad smoke may also contaminate the food which we eat . If that necessary there should be a separate smoking area in each and every restaurant  which will help to reduce public smoking where all people are present. Thus my opinion is that smoking should be completely banned throughout the country which will help the country to reduce smoking in public restaurants where people come to enjoy their meals.
As a responsible citizen of Indian i absolutely agree that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. The smoking rate in our country that too especially in the case the current generation's youth is very alarming. Smoking is one of the main reasons why thousands of  people die with cancer every year. In such a case making these people stop to smoke for at least one time  in day or a in week depending on the frequency at which they go  to a restaurant is pretty good.Infact smoking is very hazardous than drinking. The life span of of chain smoker is much much lessthan that  compared to a teetotaler.  And according the current air quality present around the world, it is not at all advisable, for instance, in the case of Delhi breathing the normal air is equivalent to smoking 7 cigarettes a day. A restaurant is a place where families, friends visit and dine in happiness. It's also a place very starting from toddlers to aged people, every age group visits. In such a place smoking is not at all advisable. The cigarettes smell is hated by many people and hen thee people sit around a smoker who just then starts smoking, they get irritated and uncomfortable and thy are high chances that they may leave the restaurant one and for all  and also they might not visit again because of the impression formed, hence it' a loss for the restaurant itself. Most t of the Restaurants are air conditioned so the same air will rotate around the room, which also includes the smoked air  Also there might be people with asthma problems or lung issues therefore it is no at all recommended to smoke near them. Hence i can conclude that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country.
"SMOKING IS INJURIOUS TO HEALTH".I agree with the statement smoking causes injurious to health. We know they are many people getting caused to cancer due to smoking. Many cases are getting admitted day by day .Every day the cancer cases are getting increased in hospitals in India wide. We see many advertisements regarding smoking causes injurious to our health. Still no people cares about that. Smoking should be banned in all restaurants in India. Smoking should be reduced in our country wide because the number of cases are getting increased everyday. Everyone must  get awareness to reduce the smoking . I say that not only in restaurants but also outside of restaurants should be reduced the usage of  cigarettes. These cigarettes are very injurious as we know but still people take those due to many reasons. Some  of the reasons are getting over stressed, pressure, workload in their companies and many more reasons are there. So whatever the reason be taking something harmful to our health is very dangerous. So I suggest to stay away from those kind off dangerous things .That is good for nature and also to living beings. This also makes harm to animals. So better to stay away from smoking. 
   Yes, I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the countries in the world. Now a days selling the products like cigaretts are increases day by day. By, smoking these cigaretts can cause cancer and many other lung disease . The person who smokes continuously   can suffer from the respiratory problems. So, the life span of the human gradually decreases for the coming years.
    There are many restaurants where  the smoking is allowed.  And a person who is smoking can suffer from respiratory problems but not only him but spreading the respiratory problems or health issues like cancer  to the following children . It passes through the generation of the human . 
  Due this smoking , the toxic gases released from it can harm the children and elders to. Where the life of the children or the elder spoil . And the factories where the  smoking products like cigaretts are made and marketed into  further restaurants . where this factories releases harmful toxic gases. which disturbs the  life cycle of the environment . and disturbs the ozone layer which kills the marine life by releasing the harmful products into it. 
  So. it is important that the country government should take an action to ban the smoking products in all the restaurants in the country.
SMOKING KILLS:  We see the disclaimer everywhere in the county including streets,cinema halls,boardings etc. saying that Smoking kills! But what's the change that happened in the country? Every small step towards the ban of tobacco and cigarette counts. One of the smallest step that can be taken is banning cigarettes in restaurants.we may look at it  as a neglected idea but it can influence a lot. We see that many restaurants provide a bar and a smoking area. Also, there are many cafes and places near schools and colleges which sells tobacco and cigarettes. Although its a business strategy to have these areas near crowded places, It would to be a trap for the school and college going students to get attracted and addicted to it. Even in family restaurants, we see a separate smoking area which can have an impact on the children. They doesn't realise that it is harmful and smoking is very normalised in the society that even the parents doesn't punish their child if they're caught smoking or drinking. These can be the very first steps to many serious addictions and can spoil the bright future of the child.Not only the children and the youth, even adults are addicted to smoking and they doesn't realise the consequences and health issues they face and doesn't think about the impact it has on their family.
 Yes, I completely agree with the statement.  Because smoking is injurious to health. It not only effects the health of the people, but also affects the health of the people who do not smoke. Hence smoking should be strictly banned in all the countries. Government should bring necessary rules in order the prohibit the smoking in our country. Most of the people are addicted towards smoking, which is very dangerous. everyone should take the initiation to stop smoking. Because smoking also effects the people who do not smoke at all. Because ,the people who stand near the person who is smoking, then the smoke enter their lungs through the air. Hence smoking should be prohibited. But when smoking is prohibited, it creates a loss for the people who cultivate tobacco. But the farmers those who cultivate tobacco should have to shift for other crops. Anyhow, prohibition of smoking is necessary. Beside these, smoking also effects the environment. Finally, government should take necessary steps to prohibit smoking .Beside government should also help the farmers who cultivate tobacco by giving some money for making them to shift to another crop.
"                       In this generation , the health became wealth in one's life .The only thing which u cannot buy with money even of you are one of the richest person in the world. as the time changes people are getting more prone to get affected by many things which are hazardous to their health. People with bad practices such as doing drugs, consuming high quantity of alcohol, smoking, vaping etc not only effect their health but also ruin the health of other people living with them, which affect them physically and mentally as well. now-a-days everyone from all age groups have smart phones with them and usage of social media is also increased. As  all kinds of content is posted in social media people who come across these practices are influenced to do them . One of these practices is smoking .
                                                                            we have come across many people in our life who smoke. Smoking not only damages their health but also is more toxic when someone breaths in the released smoke. cigars, cigarettes, E-cigarettes leaves a black residue in your lungs and when continued for a long time makes a person hard to breath, smoking can also cause lung cancer, mouth cancer and so on... . Not only this smoking also cause brain strokes and heart attacks. when a person is addicted to smoking he may get mentally affected. and YES , I agree to ban smoking in all the restaurants in a country, and I'm totally against to people who do that.  
"
Smoking is injurious to health " is just became a phrase to advertise on products and just as a disclaimer  and only become a prime focus of tobacco company uses it as their branding and market themselves . This is so ridiculous to see great hypocrisy in the world where government generate a revenue with the smoking brands and  alcoholic company . Due to this people consume lots of injurious and hazardous substances which causes them to suffer cancer and destroys their precious life . Irony of government is that both the smoking and cancer hospitals  are managed by the government and collect taxes on medicine and even on cigarettes . Smoking should not only be banned in restaurants  but also every market place. Smoking creates an addiction among consumer and becomes their  emotional support in the hard times , as a broader sense this not good for humanity . This will create a havoc in the human society and humans no longer can sustain . Smoking also creates a negative impacts on the people , individually someone smokes doesn't suffer , but also the people around him also suffers  which also damages their health . This can be controlled initially and many awareness program should be conducted to aware the addicted people   and convince them about the harmful impact of smoking and how it destroys their family and relations .
"Smoking is the act of inhaling and exhaling smoke from burning plant material, most commonly tobacco. Smoking is addictive and can cause many diseases. Smoking not only cause health problems to the smoker, but also to the people close by. Smoking especially in restaurants is a controversial topic. But I agree than smoking must be completely banned in public places mainly in restaurants. Many people complaint about their freedom of smoking in public places, but one must realise that it is hazardous to all the people. Cigarette smoke consists of harmful and carcinogenic chemicals which causes many health complications which include Cancer like lung cancer, Heart diseases, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), Arthritis, etc. When people smoke in restaurants, especially the non-smokers, are forced to inhale these toxin substances. Restaurants waiters, works are especially at high risk of inhaling these and getting affected. 
The smell of the smoke is unpleasant and even disturbs or ruins the whole environment of the restaurant especially to the non-smokers. This environment causes the other non-smokers to avoid dining in and causes loss to the restaurants as well. By banning smoking completely in the restaurants can increase the flow of the customers and also brings profits. This mainly attracts the families including children, elderly people, etc. 
In conclusion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. Banning of smoking provides healthy, hygienic environment which provide safer environment for all the people. This ensures and promotes a cleaner environment."
"Smoking is one of the dangerous practices. It is very harmful and can be fatal. Therefore, smoking must be completely banned in all restaurants in our country.
Smoking can cause diseases such as lung disease, cancer, etc. If consumed for a lengthy period, it leads to the accumulation of a huge amount of smoke in the lungs, which leads to fatal diseases like cancer and lung fibrosis.  Thus, it is unbelievably bad for one's health.
Now, restaurants are one of those places where people, families spend fun time with each other, so there would be people of every age group. Hence, smoking in such places would not only affect the smoker but also a large group of people. Children will not only have to face health issues, but they will also see smoking as a normal thing. The children might get inspired to try it, particularly teenagers. The old people may also suffer due to suffocation and bad air quality. 
Moreover, it reduces the charm of a peaceful and modest environment and makes people uncomfortable. It also raises a question on the quality of food that will be served in the restaurants. This results in a backlash of restaurants and lowers the customer demands.
Therefore, we need to get serious, as this is a genuine issue that may put many lives in danger. So, serious and immediate actions must be taken, and smoking must be banned in all restaurants in the country."
I believe smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants in the country. Eating out is something many people enjoy, and everyone deserves to do it in a clean and healthy place. When someone smokes in a restaurant, it doesn't just affect them it affects everyone around them. Secondhand smoke can be very harmful. It can cause serious health problems like breathing issues, heart disease, and even cancer. It’s especially dangerous for children, older people, and people with asthma. When someone smokes near others, those people are forced to breathe in the smoke, even if they don’t want to. That’s not fair. Restaurant workers are also at risk. They spend many hours at work and shouldn’t have to breathe in smoke just to earn a living. Everyone has the right to work in a safe and healthy place. Some people say smokers should have the freedom to smoke, but freedom should not hurt others. Smokers can still smoke in private or designated areas, but restaurants are shared spaces. The health and comfort of everyone should come first. Also, many people prefer going to restaurants that are smoke-free. It makes the air cleaner, the food taste better, and the place more enjoyable for families and friends. In the end, banning smoking in all restaurants is a smart and fair choice. It protects people’s health and makes dining out better for everyone. A smoke-free restaurant is a better restaurant for workers, customers, and even the environment.
"Smoking should be banned in restaurants because it is harmful for health and creates discomfort for non-smokers. Restaurants should be smoke free areas so that everyone can enjoy their meals in a safe and pleasant atmosphere.
 
Secondary smoke contains a lot of harmful chemicals which cause serious health issues like cancer and heart diseases. Exposure to even a small amount of smoke is dangerous for both the customers and the staff who work for long hours there. A smoking ban would ensure a healthier lifestyle for everyone.

Countries like Canada and Ireland have implemented smoke-free policies in restaurants. They have seen positive results, leading to better air quality and decreased health risks. Such examples show us that bans can have a positive impact.

 Moreover, smoking in restaurants discourages families from visiting. Children are vulnerable to the secondhand smoke and many families avoid restaurants where smoking is allowed. Smoking free restaurants would make families feel more welcome and also benefit the business economically.

As awareness of the dangers of smoking grows, more people are beginning to prefer a smoke free place. So, a smoking ban in restaurants would align with public opinion. Such measures would protect public well-being and encourage a healthier society. "
"Smoking must be totally prohibited in all restaurants across the country for the sake of public health, better dining experiences, and fairness. Cigarette smoke has more than 7,000 chemicals, most of which are poisonous and cancer-related, heart-related, and lung-related. Secondhand smoke is highly dangerous to nonsmokers, restaurant customers and workers alike, who should have a healthy environment.. A ban would eradicate the avoidable harm.
Aside from health, smoking interrupts dining. Food aromas can be overwhelmed by smoke, reducing pleasure for customers who appreciate flavor and atmosphere. Restaurants are social establishments, and a smoke-free policy allows everyone to breathe easy—literally and metaphorically. Opponents may cry about personal freedom, but that privilege ends where it starts infringing on other people's well-being. Designated smoking areas are not enough; smoke migrates, and staff members still endure exposure.
A national ban puts everyone on an equal footing. Restaurant owners worry about losing smokers as customers, but research—such as a study in the American Journal of Public Health—indicates smoke-free legislation doesn't harm profits in the long run; it tends to bring in more customers. Health, comfort, and fairness require a complete ban. It's time to clear the air."
"Smoking is a health hazard and has many ill effects on the human organs. It causes adverse effects 
on health which lead to serious health issues.  
I firmly believe that smoking should be completely banned in all the restaurants in the country. 
Firstly, smoking not only affects the person who is smoking but also causes discomfort to the people 
around. A restaurant is a public place where people generally come to have some good time with 
families or friends. A smoke free atmosphere makes more enjoyable and safer experiences for 
diners. Children and elderly people face serious discomfort. It also has affect on the business of the 
restaurant. A smoke free environment in the restaurant can help promote the business. It also 
reduces air pollution though smoking might have a very little contribution to the air pollution. It also 
gives a pleasant, fresh and inviting atmosphere for customers and gives a better hospitality. Smoking 
causes respiratory problems and has many other ill effects on health. It also reduces the air quality 
of the atmosphere in the restaurants. Smoking can also cause accidental fires in the restaurant. 
Smoke free restaurants are preferred more. Restaurants banning smoking can influence other 
businesses or institutes to follow and inculcate social responsibility among everyone. 
A complete ban on smoking in restaurants is essential for protecting public health, improving 
cleanliness and thereby providing a pleasant atmosphere for everyone in the surroundings. It also 
reminds social responsibility among people. "
"Imagine walking in a beautiful park, enjoying the fresh air, the sound of birds, and the sight of children 
playing. Suddenly, someone nearby  lights a cigarette. The fresh air is gone. The relaxing moment is 
ruined by smoke, smell, and discomfort. This is why many people believe that smoking should be banned 
in public places—not just in some countries, but everywhere. 
First of all, smoking doesn’t just harm the person doing it. When someone smokes in public, everyone 
around them is forced to breathe in the smoke too. This is called secondhand smoke, and it's very 
dangerous. It can cause asthma, lung problems, and even heart disease in people who don’t smoke at all. 
Children and the elderly are especially at risk. Why should innocent people suffer for someone else’s 
habit? 
Also, banning smoking in public places can protect the environment. Cigarette butts are the most littered 
item in the world. They’re thrown on streets, beaches, and parks. Not only do they look ugly, but they also 
take years to break down and are harmful to animals and plants. Clean public spaces are everyone's right, 
and smoking often ruins that. 

In conclusion, smoking in public places should be banned in more countries around the world. It protects 
people’s health, keeps the environment cleaner, and encourages better habits. A cigarette may seem small, 
but the smoke it creates has a big, negative impact. Let’s imagine a world where the air is clean, the parks 
are safe, and no one has to worry about breathing in harmful smoke while simply enjoying life outside."
"Smoking in public places has become a topic of debate in many countries. Some people believe it should be completely banned, while others think smokers have the right to smoke wherever they want. However, smoking in public spaces should be completely banned because it harms not just the smoker, but also the people around them.

When someone smokes in a public area, the smoke spreads and affects others nearby. This is called secondhand smoke. Many studies have shown that secondhand smoke is dangerous and can cause health problems like asthma, lung disease, and even cancer. Children, pregnant women, and older people are especially at risk. Banning smoking in public areas would protect everyone’s health.

In addition to health problems, smoking also pollutes the environment. Cigarette butts are often thrown on the ground, which makes streets and parks dirty. These butts are harmful to animals and take years to decompose. A ban on public smoking would help keep our surroundings clean and safe.

Some people argue that banning smoking in public takes away personal freedom. But when that freedom harms others, it becomes a social issue. Everyone has the right to breathe clean air, and that right should not be taken away by someone’s smoking habit.

In conclusion, smoking should be completely banned in public spaces. It protects public health, keeps the environment clean, and supports a healthier lifestyle for everyone. While smokers can still smoke in private places, public areas should remain smoke-free for the safety and comfort of public."
"My name is XXX , and I firmly feel that smoking should be totally banned in all 
restaurants in the country. There are some very crucial reasons why such a ban is 
needed. 
Secondly, smoking is a serious health risk—not only to smokers, but to everyone 
around them. Secondhand smoke has toxic chemicals in it that can cause dangerous 
health problems like asthma, heart disease, and even cancer in people who do not 
smoke. To inhale cigarette smoke while in a restaurant, where individuals go to eat 
andsocialize, can be highly unpleasant and unhealthy. 
Secondly, prohibiting smoking makes the environment cleaner and more pleasant for 
everyone. The odor of smoke can spoil the flavor of food and remain in the air, 
creating an unpleasant atmosphere. A smoke-free restaurant is more inviting to 
everyone, particularly children, pregnant women, and individuals with health issues. 
In addition, most nations that have prohibited smoking in public areas have 
experienced positive outcomes. Restaurants tend to draw more patrons, particularly 
families, when the atmosphere is healthy and clean. Employees also gain from a 
healthier working environment, free from the risks of passive smoking. "
There’s something comforting about eating out whether it’s smell of freshly cooked food, the buzz of conversation, or just a moment to relax. But all of that fades the second someone lights a cigarette nearby. The smell overpowers the aroma of the food, your head starts to hurt, and your comfort disappears. It’s frustrating how one person’s habit can ruin an experience for everyone else.   Smoking in public spaces, especially restaurants, affects everyone around. The smoke of cigarette is proven to be dangerous, causing breathing issues, headaches, and even long term health problem. Why should innocent people suffer just because someone else choose to smoke?  Restaurants are meant for enjoyment, food, and connection not coughing fits or eye irritation. Even the restaurant staff, who work long shifts, are forced to inhale smoke if it’s allowed indoors. Some argue that smokers have rights, and they do. But those rights should end  where someone else’s health begins. Smokers can step outside. Non smokers can’t escape the air inside.Banning smoking in restaurants isn’t about taking away freedom. It’s about creating safe, clean, and welcoming spaces for everyone especially families, children, and those with health conditions
Smoking has been associated with serious health risks, both for smokers and for those exposed to secondhand smoke. Despite this, smoking in public places such as restaurants, is still allowed in some areas.One of the most important reasons for banning smoking in restaurants is to ‘protectpeople from harmful effects of secondhand smoke. Second hand smoke contain more than 7,000 chemicals, may of which are toxic and can cause cancer. Non-smokers who are exposed to the smoke or at increased risks of developing respiratory problems, heart disease, and even lung cancer. In a restaurant setting, where people come to enjoy food and socialize, no one should be forced to inhale harmful smoke due to someone else’s habits.Moreover, banning smoking in restaurants creates a cleaner and more pleasant environment for all customers. The smell of smoke can ruin the taste and aroma of food. Restaurants works also deserve protection. Waiters, cooks, and other staff members spend hours in this environment so smoking has to be banned in restaurants. As the saying says, ‘’ Smoking is injuries to health, it causes cancer’’,It is extremely important to take care of ones health and believe in ‘prevention than cure’. One need to care of well being and stay and healthy.
SMOKING in restaurant should be completely banned in India to protect the health of people. Restaurants are public places where families, including children and elderly people, come to eat and relax. If someone smoke in such places, it affects everyone around them through passive smoking, which is very harmful. Second hand smoke cause serious health problems like ASTHAMA, CANCER AND HEART DISEASES. Non-smokers should not be forced to breathe in smoke just because someone near the smoking. everyone has right to inhale clean and fresh air.  Also, the smell of cigarette smoke can spoil the taste and enjoyment of food. It makes the environment unpleasant for customers and may affect the business of restaurant. India has taken some steps to ban smoking in public areas, but the rule is not always followed strictly. By banning the cigarette at restaurants would help to create a healthier environment for all. Smoking not only causes damage to one individual but it will also impact the people surrounding him, causing inhaling problems, pollutant air. The surroundings and the immediate environment are also heavily impacted by chain smokers. BANNING SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES IS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN GOOD HEALTH,  FOR PUBLIC COMFORT AND FOR GOOD ENVIRONMENT 
Yes,  I do agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, as many people who smoke and the people around them are also effected with many major health issues like Respiratory diseases, Lun cancers, skin allegies etc. Mostly children are effect by these. Due to the people who smoke, children often get influenced by them  and start to smoke at a very young age. Students and youth are easily to take up this habit. It is making mny to get attracted as it is shown as a regular habit for many heroes in the movies. looking at this kind of things in the movies makes younger people to take the habit and spoil the health. Restaurants are the places which are visited by all the people. They are the places which are visited by families for celebrationing some events. so, if they allow people to smoke , it will cause a bad effect on the people who are present at that time. Kids and children will not know the badness of this and they easily try to take up the habit. So to put an end to all this and keep the kids and younger people not to take this habit it is better to stop peope smoke in restaurants. 
Smoking is one of the most deadliest addictions on the planet. The extremely cryogenic nature of it is terminal to human life. The worst part is that it's adverse effects are as effective to people around the smoker as it is effective to himself. When smoke produced from cigarettes is inhaled by people around it does damage to the lungs as if they themselves have smoked a pack. This is a serious issue which needs to be addressed immediately. This issue is mostly observed at restaurants where family come to enjoy some good food but are exposed to such harmful fumes. The damage done by the smoke to our lungs is not curable and in worst case can lead to lung cancer as well. It is also important to note that many are allergic and suffer coughs and other reactions when exposed to cigarette smoke. Continuing to surrender to the habit of smoking without realizing that it is effecting the people around you should be considered a crime. Smokers cannot stop their habit all a sudden so we need to come up with some other alternative. One of the solution to this is to provide a separate smoking section far from the tables at restaurants and banning the act of smoking near the tables. With this the ill effects can be reduced by a lot and our families and kids can be safeguarded from this vicious addiction.
"Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country."  I agree with this statement. Smoking is injurious to health and it is unhealthy  to the person who is breathing the smoked out air.  And restaurant is a place where people come to eat and when the smoked air get in the food place the food will  also get poluted and it is very unhealthy to people consuming the food.  Imagine a person smoking in a restraunt it is going to effect the person himself, the people areound him and  the air which is polluted gets into the food eaten by  others. Here we can see that a lot of people smoke even thought it is contagious to our health.  we could have a dfferent room in restraunt which is closed and would not effect someone else. As this is a serious concern to someone who is pure and healthy and not addicted to smoking, Action needs to be  done on this. Even when we make a smoking room in the restaurants there is many chances that from the room also the smell comes out and with this smell only the others who are not smoking will also get their health affetced. 
Smoking is completely harmful for everyone who is smoking and the person standing next to them. We were always told that smoking causes cancer and is very harmful despite of all these cautions given still people tend to smoke just to get relief from the stress. Smoking in private areas like home or personal cabin might be fine but smoking in an open area where public is presnt is completely offensive. Smoking in restuarants is a big NO! As it effects the people around them in which it leads to the others smoking indirectly without their acknowledgment It is a very offensice act smoking in restaurants etc. If this is taling place the management should take a stand and ask the individual tp stop smoking or may ask him to leave the premises and to complete the business in private and then come back. People should be aware that smoking effects the peron who smoke but also the people around them we don’t know which person is facing which health issue like astham etc and if smoking takes place around him it might be harmful. Hence smoking should be completely stopped by everyone and educate the society on the harmful after effects of smoking at the restaurants and public areas. Here I conclude that smoking shpuld be banned comepletely and shouldn’t be encouraged by anyone to smoke in public places and to take stand in the society not to promote smoking.
I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. As its harmful for the person smoking and they person around the one who is smoking. A prime example is Delhi the capital of India, It is the most Air polluted state in India, Breathing the air in Delhi is equal to smoking 4 times a day. Many types of people visit an restaurants, A few may smoke and a few may not smoke its their own choice but smoking in public places such as a restaurants is not acceptable as many people might suffer from the smell and smoke around them. Few restaurants have seen this issues as a major problem, As they cant forcefully make a smoker quit they have instead created an smoking zone which is isolated from the restaurant and is an open space where the smoke can go away with ease. But any restaurant is not a place for smoking and we shouldn't encourage such acts and put a strict ban on smoking in public places as various people are present. Quitting smoking is an option, But smoking in a public place is a crime. I urge the Government Of India to ban smoking in all restaurants or any public places. 
Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.yes I agrre with it as the people around will not feel comfortable .It is bad for your health but some fell it as a achivment to start smoking .stoping it is in our hads governament should take it in there hands to stop this habit from people. If the government think about it seriously than t is possible to bring this change in the society and make a healthy society. people also must understand the bad things that happen with this habit. It may look style in the first moment. But, if we still do it we will become affected badly with this as it spoils our lungs and we may get many lung problems when a person is young they will not understand this when they get old they will know. But better to stop in the first time olny rather to wait till your helath spoils. So it is not just the gvernment task but it is the tsak of the people to understand about this bad habit. In the smoking advertisemesnt also it will be shown as bad only. But many will not understan this and they try and become addicted. So, I strongly say that smoking should be banned in restaranrs.
I strongly agree with this statement because firstly smoking is danger and also the youth are getting attracted and affected with the habit of smoking which will only lead to downfall of our country. When people smoke in public places the others people get bad habit by it due to smoking, even the place becomes bad and gets polluted because of it. Habits like smoking are passed to others by involving them in style and due to wrong friends these smoking habits will affect families mostly. They are not just affecting them but even the people around them and the nature face the result. The point is sense is lost in our country there needs to be strict punishment to the people who smoke in public places. Even when the waste smoking is difficult to bare makes it more danger and the fact that it is allowed to sell this legal. Most of the students get into such bad habit due to the people they follow, famous film stars, sports people, super people and important people promote such cigarette brands or they smoke in public or on the screen which makes the youth follow and they into smoking and get addicted to it.
"Yes I agree that smoking should be banned in all the restaurants in the country
Because as we know that smoking causes cancer and also a important thing is that smoking is very dangerous to the person who is adjacent to them the person who is smoking. Smoking is one of the worst addiction to all the persons .If the smoking is allowed in the restaurant's the persons who goes to the restaurants will be uncomfortable. If the children and pregnant ladies are nearby they will get effected very much. Our country children has no protection but we should go ahead and ban the smoking in all the restaurants . smokers should have a area where they can smoke but not in the restaurants so our government should give a strict rule that smoking is prohibited in restaurants .everyone should be aware of it. If restaurants continue the same the young teens will get influenced but seeing at them and think as a fashion and will get addicted to the smoke. I conclude that the smoking should not only banned in all the restaurants but also in all the public areas like bus stops ,hospitals, and etc..
so by concluding this I will agree completely with the statement 
"
My opinion is somewhat different in this topic , i prefer staying neutral . we can see that there are huge amount of chain smokers in our country  , who smokes more that 10 plus ciggarettes a day which is obviously not healthy. there are many surveys which conducted several test on chain smokers and the conclusion of this survey was that , this habit is very difficult to control . i also agree that smoking in public places may make many people uncomfortable who are not habitual of this smoke but banning it can't solve the issue . i prefer making seperate  section for people who smokes after every hour and so or for the people who want to refresh their minds . keeping this section away from the family section would be worth . as , the family with their children can enjoy their meal and have a great time . there are several restaurants who follow the same procedure and manage all kind of people . banning alone can't solve the actual problem , because such people will start smoking anywhere in the public if they are not provided with specific place . where they can fresh up their minds
I strongly  disagree with this statement because firstly smoking is stylish and also the youth of our country are getting the habit of smoking which will progress lead to our country. When people smoke in public places the other people get to know smoking. Habits like smoking are passed to others by involving them in peer pressure and due to influence from friends these smoking habits will affect families.  Nobody is force to smoke they spoke on wish to smoke. So smoking is not forcing anyone. If one want to smoke they must smoke no force to smoke but one enjoys smoke they must do it. No one should stop them to smoke. They should smoke if one want. When people smoke in public places the other people get to know smoking.  Nobody is force to smoke they spoke on wish to smoke. The one smoke knows he is smoking and he do it with knowing and why should he be stopped. He is not force to smoke someone he is smoke he like smoking. So smoke is not banning in all places. One should have one place outside home to smoke also. It is important to have smoke place outside. If it is banned it is difficult. 
I agree  the second statement too.We that drinking and smoking are injurious to health knowing it many people does and do the same thing everywhere and everytime.Smoking is a very bad habit that too smoking in the public places such as restaurants is a very bad habit and it should be strictly prohibited.At reataurants people visit there inorder to have their food  but,making the food unhealthy by smoking at that place is very bad.The goverment of the city must take resposibility in the production of cigrates as well as other things that makes the people sick.If the person himself avoid all the stuff of drinking as well as smoking the people aroungd him/her making them unhealthy. Banning the smoking at the people living areas such a restaurants makes the place smoke free and they can have their food without worrying about their health.Day by the cigrates consumption is going on increasing this make the people feel insecure about their health.We asthe citizens of India we have take care about our health as well as the peoples health so,the politicians must take some resbonsibility inoredr to decrease the consumption of alcohol as well as other diziness causing materials which are harmful to our health.
Definitely, I agree that it should be banned in every restaurant in every corner of the street so that people should be better in the society. As we all know smoking is injurious to health, it must be banned as even its credentials are not good for health.  So, we can even bring a law against it, so that they could be punished. Because, once we addict to it, then it's a serious problem which can cause cancer and even sometimes lead to death. So, we need to be  very cautious about smoking. Even because when the other person smoke, the person beside him tends to attain the smell and can damage his liver also which infects him too ,so it's so dangerous to both the persons. So my kind request to ban it or to get better awareness about smoking to everyone. Making it  ban in every restaurant can help people to forget and avoid it and could get better in the society.  There must raise a rule for not smoking not only in restaurants but everywhere. Spreading awareness even helps many people to understand better about it. So, for the ones who was habituated before only can avoid it by using medicines and preferably stopping it from further damage. So, final statement comes here "Smoking is injurious  to health".
I believe smoking should be banned in all restaurants across the country. Smoking affects not just the person who does it but also others nearby. Breathing in smoke can cause health issues like asthma, coughing, and other serious problems, especially for children and the elderly. Restaurants are places where people go to enjoy meals, relax, and spend time with loved ones. The smell of cigarettes can ruin the atmosphere and make the food less enjoyable. It also creates an unhealthy environment for both customers and staff. Non-smokers should not have to suffer just because someone chooses to smoke. If smoking is not allowed, more people will feel comfortable eating out. It also shows care and respect for everyone’s well-being. In addition, when smoking is restricted in public places, some people might reduce their smoking or try to quit. This can lead to a healthier society overall. Many countries have already stopped smoking in indoor public areas, and the results have been positive. Clean air in restaurants makes the experience better for everyone. To keep restaurants safe and pleasant, it is important to have a smoke-free space. That way, people can enjoy their food without worrying about their health or the smell of smoke.
I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. First of all, smoking is very harmful to our health. It causes serious diseases like cancer and heart problems. But the problem is not only for smokers. People who are near smokers also breathe the smoke. This is called passive smoking, and it is also very dangerous. In restaurants, many people come with their families, including children and old people. They should not be forced to breathe in smoke while eating. Second, the smell of smoke can make the restaurant environment very unpleasant. When someone smokes, the smell stays in the air and on clothes. This can make the food taste and smell bad for others. People go to restaurants to enjoy food and relax, not to smell smoke. Also, banning smoking in restaurants can help smokers. When they cannot smoke in public places, they may smoke less. This can help them become healthier over time. Many countries already have rules against smoking in restaurants, and it works well. It creates a clean and comfortable place for everyone. In conclusion, banning smoking in restaurants is a good idea. It helps protect people’s health and makes restaurants better for all. Everyone deserves clean air while eating.
I strongly agree that smoking should be banned from all the restaurants  in the country because smoking is very dangerous for the human being. Smoking is dangerous for the one who is consuming it and also for the person who is near to the person because when the person who is smoking is also making the people near him inhale that bad gas and making their health bad too. Smoking is literally killing people of the country and something like this should must be banned from the country. the advantages of banning smoking are very much the country will be more healthier and pollution free and also it is good for each and every person in this country. The health issues caused by smoking will be reduced and at a point it will be none which somehow help the country to develop more and it is a very good decision for the country development the people of country will be healthier. smoking causes global problems also and hence if we ban smoking in the country our environment will also be clean and neater and healthier. There are a lot of advantages of banning smoking in the country it is a very hard decision but the decisions which hard to take are the best decisions
i strongly agree with the statement that smoking in  public  places like restraunts and all. it not only discomforts the customers but also stands as anti socail activity.it disturbs ones meal whn they are having thier meal time and that interepts their personal time. it is like vadilating the publics space and also discomforting them in the public plac where they have come to have thier family time or thier self time . it also ruins ones interest to have thier meal ans also thier health even if its no them who a smoking but aslo their comfort zone in a way it means that whoever is smoking is using their action to cause harm or discomfort for others so pubic care is not kept in mind by them this is disrespectful to the people around and shows that social responsibility is missing in the smoker. It is a space fr a s it shud be comfortable for everyone nt just those who are smoking. Smetimes someone can have heath issue and maybe eating nearby and the smoke makes it worse for them this is risky and who can take responsibility for this to avoid situations ike this and to show respect t a the pepe in shared spaces, it is important to ban smoking in  public  places
"Banning smoking in all restaurants across India is a crucial step towards creating a healthier environment for citizens. The hazardous effects of secondhand smoke are well-documented, and exposing restaurant patrons and staff to this toxic substance is unacceptable.
Implementing a nationwide ban on smoking in restaurants would significantly reduce the risk of smoking-related illnesses, such as lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory problems. Moreover, it would also help to reduce the number of smokers in India, as the absence of smoking in public places would discourage people, especially the youth, from taking up the habit.
The ban would also have economic benefits for the restaurant industry. Smoke-free environments are more appealing to customers, particularly foreign tourists, who often prefer dining in smoke-free establishments. This, in turn, would boost the hospitality industry and increase revenue.
Some argue that a smoking ban would infringe upon the rights of smokers and negatively impact businesses. However, the rights of non-smokers to breathe clean air should take precedence over the rights of smokers. Moreover, restaurants can provide designated smoking areas outside, minimizing the impact on smokers.
Several countries have successfully implemented smoking bans in public places, including restaurants, and have seen significant improvements in public health. India can follow suit and create a healthier environment for its citizens.
In conclusion, banning smoking in all restaurants across India is a necessary measure to protect public health, reduce smoking-related illnesses, and promote a healthier environment. It is time for India to take a proactive step towards a smoke-free future and join the ranks of countries that have already implemented similar bans. By doing so, India can ensure a healthier and more prosperous future for its citizens."
