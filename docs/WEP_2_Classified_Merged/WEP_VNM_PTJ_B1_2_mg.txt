I will express my thoughts on whether part-time work is really important for students or not. Of course I completely agree with this opinion. Because working part-time after school can help you earn enough money for daily living, catering or entertainment needs, in addition, this can also help you. Some students with difficult family circumstances can help their families with part of their tuition fees. Working overtime can also help you accumulate more valuable knowledge in society, while also developing soft skills such as communication, time management, and teamwork. Helps students build a network of relationships and expand future career opportunities.However, working part-time also has certain challenges. .It is important for students to choose jobs that suit their study schedule and health, as well as develop effective time management skills. This way, they can take advantage of the benefits of part-time work without compromising their main study goals. If students do not know how to balance work and study, they are susceptible to stress, fatigue, and academic performance. Finally, being independent while working part-time also trains a sense of responsibility and confidence, better preparing for life after graduation. So I think that part-time work will be very important for students, it will help you a lot, and choose a job that suits you and know how to stay healthy to be able to work. work and study well.
"I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Part-time employment provides students with valuable work experience that can be crucial for their future careers. For example, working in a customer service role helps students develop communication and problem-solving skills, which are highly valued by employers. Additionally, part-time jobs teach students time management skills, as they must balance work responsibilities with their academic studies.

Moreover, part-time work can alleviate some of the financial burdens associated with college. Many students face high tuition fees and living expenses, and a part-time job can help cover these costs, reducing the need for student loans. In reality, a student working part-time as a tutor or in a retail store can earn enough money to pay for textbooks and other necessary supplies. 

Lastly, having a part-time job can provide students with a sense of independence and responsibility. It encourages them to be more self-sufficient and better prepared for life after graduation. Managing work schedules, meeting deadlines, and handling finances are all aspects of adulthood that students can practice through part-time employment.

In conclusion, part-time jobs offer college students practical benefits that extend beyond financial support. They provide essential life skills, work experience, and a sense of responsibility, making them an important aspect of the college experience."
"It is undeniable that having a job during leisure times would be a great experience for students in college. However, I would argue that there are some drawbacks of having a part-time job during college time.
On the one hand, having a job can bring about many benefits for college students. First, it is totally a great opportunity for those who want to gain some new skills. For example, by working as a waiter in a restaurant, one can not only learn how to do things in a careful way, but can also have a chance to communicate with people from all walks of life, which definitely enhances their communication skills. In addition, the act of having a part-time job can be beneficial in terms of problem-solving skills, making one more skillful in solving real life situations. Lastly, having a job is absolutely a good way to make more income, especially for those who have some economic difficulties. 
On the other hand, given many benefits listed above, having a job in accompany with school works is not the best idea. In fact, by doing two works at a time could make one’s life imbalanced. This is because it is somewhat lacking of time for ones to focusing on their homework after hours of hardworking, in addition to their large study schedules. Additionally, it is sometime hard for ones who have just entered the college to adapt with the real life environments, as they have been nourished and helped by their parents for a very long period of time. 
In conclusion, I think that although having a part-time job can be beneficial for college students, but it can give rise to some significant drawbacks. The final decision to whether work or not would solely depend on their preferences and main problems.

"Owing to the advancement in living standard, the daily expenses of the populations have significantly increased regarding the medical, educational section,…Hence, to relieve the parents’ financial burden, several tertiary learners spend their time engaging in part-time jobs. While there are numerous advocates support that notion, some critics oppose that it would detrimentally affect the students. From my perspective, I strongly agree with the former idea, and the following essay will state some reasons to support my viewpoint.
Regarding the financial aspects, doing part-time jobs not only positively affect the parents but also themselves. In fact, some students can not afford to their tuition fee and eventually drop out of school due to the escalating costs. In some cases, parents simultaneously do several occupations to earn more money, expecting their children will have a better access to a qualified education. Therefore, students may have much more income by working part time as to pay for the pricey tuition fee and also purchasing their interested things by themselves.
In contrast, some people criticize that part-time jobs engagement lead to the poor academic performance of students, possibly hampering students from concentrating on their studies and encountering severe health problems under long-working hours. Although it may sound true to some certain extent, I still concur that it offers various advantages for college students. Another merit of partaking in part-time job is that students can enhance their soft skills such as problem-solving, time management skill, … which can not be taught in class. Those skills play a crucial role which help students to be well-prepared prior to embarking in their careers. 
In conclusion, doing part time jobs provide several advantages for college students due to various reasons. However, students should make a timetable to strike a work-study balance and mitigate the potential demerits."
"As the constant development of today society, everything seems to be priceyer than in the past. The majority of students who follow advanced learning need to take a part time job to meet the bills of high level programs and basic living condition. To me, I think it is just a natural tendency and apparent result of digital era for a few reasons. 
To start with, not only does part-time job bring forth monetary value but also a great deal of social experience. Youngsters will have great chances to interact with different kinds of people outside their school, hence, they will improve soft skill, problem-solving skill, team-working skill in a long term. Secondly, some students would love to join in corporations relating to their major, which will give them a few achievements and valuable experience to fulfil their cv after graduation. It is obvious that companies and organizations prefer an attendant with a lot of experience and sufficient mettle from reality to the one just giving out academic qualifications at school without a single real-life knowledge confirmation. Last but not least, the main reason why the rate of students joining part-time industry has rocketed so far is financial burden. Entering university means opening the world of maturity for that reason they have more stuffs to worry about than just focusing on studying like it used to be in the past such as the school fee, electricity bill, water bill, food and drink.
In summary, it is true that students should spend time for educational purpose but the benefits of having a part-time job is undeniable and adolescents who has the ability to balance working and studying will cultivate fruitful achievements in the future."
"I strongly agree with the opinion that emphasizes the importance of a part-time job for college students as long as students can balance between studying at school and having part-time job because of the benefits a part-time job can give them. 
First of all, they’ll have extra money, that can help with living expenses to have less burden on their family, or they can use it as savings for their important goals in the future. 
Secondly, having a part-time job for college students is a helpful way for them to explore the working field and having social networks that will benefit them in the future. Nowadays, students can easily find a part-time job that is related to their major in college. It’s easy for students in logistic, computer science or travel field to find related part-time job. Even in some major that is hard to think about having a part-time job such as the medical field, students can find a part-time job related to clinics, and clinical researches at school. That job can help medical students approach to the patients, have a brief understanding of what they will do with their job and build social network with seniors to mentor them.
Thirdly, students can develop plenty of soft skills when having a part-time job. For example, time management skills and planning skills will obviously developed well when they can balance between having a job and studying at school. Other remarkable skills such as social communication skills, money management skills that are raised when having a part-time job is helpful in the future. 
Finally, having a part-time job is a great way for students to explore themselves, knowing what fits them better, to have a more focus studying and training for the job they chose. "
"People of different ages need money and college students are not the exception. A majority of people claim that college students should have a part-time job to address the issues related to finance. However, others think that college students should exclusively concentrate on their learning. In this essay, I will state a neutral point of view towards the following topic.
On the one hand, possessing a part-time job could foster the inner growth of students and help them to be more mature. To demonstrate, getting involved in the working environment is deemed to be complex as students could confront predicaments that they have not experienced before and be forced to adapt to uncomfortable circumstances. If they can overcome such difficulties, it is believed that they could develop a more stable mentality as well as confidence. 
On the other hand, spending too much time on part-time jobs could induce a decrease in academic performance among students. Particularly, higher education is an academically competitive environment. Without extra time spent on exercises outside the class, it could be a huge disadvantage for students since they could not further elaborate or expand their pool of knowledge. As a result, they would hardly achieve any prominent awards to benefit their after-college path.
In conclusion, having a part-time job could be an intriguing experience as it provides students with thoughtful insights. However, their learning at the university should also be taken into consideration. Indeed, gaining positive results at college could also create opportunities for their future career. "
"Nowadays, students studying at the university make end meet to help their family. It can be given by many reasons.
On the one hand we can get is supplemental income. Many college students face significant financial burdens, including tuition fees, textbooks. A part-time job can provide much-needed income to help cover these costs. Besides, earning and managing money can teach students important financial skills, such as budgeting, saving, and understanding the value of money.
On the second hand, part-time positions may be less stable, with fewer guarantees of long-term employment. Employers might prioritize full-time employees during restructuring.
However, it takes some disadvantages, it wastes much time instead of doing other things or you can study better your specialties with flying colors. Furthermore, it also has lower status and recognition. Part-time employees might not be perceived as integral members of the team and may receive less recognition for their contributions. Finally Limited Skill Development: Some part-time jobs may offer fewer opportunities to learn new skills or gain valuable experience compared to full-time positions.
In conclusion, I think although part time job play some crucial role but it also has some significative inconvenient when you discuss this problem. The best solution is that we need to balance between two thing so that we can find the method effectively."
"It is said that college students should engage in part – time job for many benefits such as financial independence, real – life experience, but it is crucial to recognize that a part – time job might not be universally good for every student. 
To begin with, getting a good result is the primary objective of college. Students have to balance difficult courses and a lot of homework. Having a part – time job can lead to stress and burnout. When students are stressed, their grades and overall health might suffer.
Also, not all part – time jobs are related to what students want to do in their careers. Many students work in jobs that don’t help with their goals, which means the job might not be very useful for their plans in the future.
Additionally, there are many other ways to support school fee. Scholarship, sponsors, and student loans are variable to help students with their finances. Relying on a part – time job might not be necessary if these supports are used effectively. 
Finally, students might get more benefits from using their time for activities related to their field of study, like internships or research. These experiences can be more valuable for their future careers than a part – time job that isn’t related to their goals.
In conclusion, while working part – time can have benefits, I think it’s not always the best option for every college student."
"Many people believe that it is essential for university students to have a part-time job. Personally, I agree with this sentiment for a number of reasons.

First of all, going to college is not just about studying and gaining knowledge; it is also about developing skills. When a student have a part-time job, they can develop many soft skills as well as hard skills such as time management skills, teamwork skills, communication skills and computer skills. These skills are all very crucial for their future career. Therefore, if a student have a part-time job while going to college, they have the opportunity to develop many valuable skills, which are beneficial for both their study and future work.

Second, college students can earn some money to help with their tuition fees and living expenses. When a student goes to college, their parents have to pay for them many kinds of fees. It can be a burden to them. If a student have a part-time job, they can earn some money to pay their own fees although the salary may not be too high.

Finally, students should be encouraged to have a part-time job because it helps them to be more active and responsible. When a student have a part-time job, they will find a way to balance their study and their work. They have to ensure that their work will not interfere their study, which makes them more responsible. Having a part-time job also helps college students more active because they have to work and study at the same time.

In conclusion, I believe that university students should have a part-time job because it will bring about a great number of benefits for them."
"Undergraduates nowadays are expected to not only be academically capable but also have the experience to get a job. Thus, part-time jobs are considered by many to be imperative for college students, as they help them gain hands-on experience, improve their confidence, soft skills, all of which are highly desirable by employers. The aim of this essay is to shed light on how a part-time job contributes to the overall success of college students, as well as underscoring aspects of which students should be aware to fully utilize part-time job.
A part-time job is a work position where people devote a certain amount of their day to work in exchange for financial gain. It is notable that part-time jobs only require employees to work for 4 to 5 hours, whereas a typical nine-to-five job would take 8 to 10 hours daily, and part-time jobs are highly flexible. With the nature of a part-time job, college students can earn money while attending undergraduate programs. Hence, a part-time job can help students develop their soft skills and gain confidence. In addition, students who work part-time can learn how to manage their time, as they are required to juggle between work and study at their educational institutions. Nevertheless, a part-time job can be the cause that affects students’ academic achievement. Most students are not equipped with knowledge on how to manage their time effectively, hence causing students to multi-task between their work and study assignments at their institutions. 
In conclusion, while a part-time job might help students to gain experience and develop their skills at work, students who are unable to manage their time can suffer as a result. Therefore, it is essential that undergraduates equip themselves with time-management skills in addition to the support from their institutions, parents, and experts."
"i agree with that idea because when a college students have part time job they can have more money to using also they know is rely hard to earn money. from that they have more respect with money that parent spent for them to the university and have better life. When we go out and have a part time job it also can practice english when we have to talk with our customer or just talk to partner , for who got the trend introverted get a part time job can improve the social skill to get better in communication. Get new job that mean we know more friend and more experiment for future. have a part time job that got a lot of adventage 
if we do a great job like from waiter to manager in five guys or any restaurent or the convenient we can have alot in come and good at finance can open we realationship. It may can pay for college bill. for me am a college student i have work in the sushi shop and can bring some free food to home and eat like dinner it save a lot money."
"In recent years, the university student working part-time is one of the extremely popular situations, it not only wastes time but also has a negative impact on classroom results. So I disagree.

In my opinion, every part-time student will cause a sense of lethargy, drowsiness whenever she finishes working, negatively affecting class hours in class. This causes extremely dangerous consequences, maybe a case that makes you get some money, but until the results are not good, you have to spend 3 to 4 times the money to pay for the educational money. From a person who wants to make money to help the family to become more costly, this is bad. 

But it must also be said that the part-time job also has its good aspects if you can take advantage of time, or if a student manages a good time or arranges a reasonable time, this is great, you can just have income for yourself and also study well in the lecture hall. 

In short, this depends on each individual, each person has his own way of thinking, and we cannot change their thoughts. So although I did not agree, I did not condemn this issue, because everyone had a private life."
"In my opinion, I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.

The first reason is that college students when they have a time -to -time job, they will gain practical experiences such as working skills, time management, and communication with people. These will help students have more soft skills, confident skills, learn how to handle situations and build relationships that may help their future work. In addition, to develop themselves, students can help cover living expenses, reduce the burden on the family by receiving salary from those part-time jobs. 

However, part-time jobs also affect students as some jobs are not related to the students' field. It may not be networked for long-term benefits, pressure and fatigue when working can be photos. Students should enjoy their rest because if there is no balance between learning, part-time and reasonable rest, that will make them prone to stress and stress. If students can arrange a reasonable time and choose a job that is suitable for the field of study, the part-time job will be very beneficial for students.

In conclusion, having a part-time job is necessary for students to have more skills and relationships, but they should balance between working and learning. "
"Some people think that college students, who have a lot of spare time, having a part-time job is an essential activity after school. From my perspective, I partly agree with this statement on account of some reasons below. 

On the one hand, college students would spend much of money for university so that they should have a part-time job to cover personal expenses and reduce dependence on parents. Work experience is one of some benefits to have a part-time job because it builds some practical skills which enhance your resume for the future jobs. Moreover, students of university could build relationships through outside activities, so having a part-time job is such a great experience that they take networking opportunities for their future careers. 

On the other hand, having a half-time work could have some downsides by some reasons. College students may involve many tasks and homework after joining classes, it requires them to spend many hours to meet the deadline but part-time jobs would limit their time for doing homework and some social activities. Furthermore, they might face with academic pressure because they have to maintain the balance between work and studies, which can be stressful and affect academic performances.  

College students should get part-time jobs depending on their ability to manage their time and maintain the balance well. They can take advantage of half-time work to improve many requirements and help in their careers but students should ensure that part-time job doesn't negatively influence on their studies. "
I strongly agree that having a part time job is important for college students. Firstly, it prove the financial independence of students. Many students rely on financial support of their parent, so that a part time job allows them to earn their own money and manage their expenses. This experience teach them about the value of money and budgeting. Secondly, a part time job  helps students develop time management skills. Balancing work and studies requires effective planning and time management , which are essential skills for future careers and daily life. Students learn to allocate their time efficiently, ensuring they meet both academic and work commitments. Moreover, part-time jobs offer practical experience. Students gain insights into the working world, which can be beneficial when they enter the job market after graduate. They develop soft skills such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving, which are highly valued with employers. Lastly, working part-time can enhance the student’s resume. Employers often look for candidates with work experience, and having a part-time job demonstrates the student’s ability to handle responsibilities and work under pressure. In conclusion, having a part-time job during college is beneficial as it fosters financial independence, time management, practical experience, and enhances employability.
"There are many people who believe that the undergraduate should spend their time working a part-time job. I strongly agree with this point of view because a lot of part- time work only requires minimum skill sets, experience, and a flexible schedule which is suitable for college students.

First of all, it is generally agreed that students can get more practical experience for both their future careers. In fact, formal training under college or university institutions only provides students with a basic background of knowledge. Therefore, working part-time seems to be more advantageous as it helps students to learn more about responsibilities as well as business hurdles they might encounter, which reinforces what they are learning in school. For example, some studies proved that students working part-time jobs have more confidence than the others when they get into the work field after graduation. 

Furthermore, with part-time work, students can earn more money to spend on their daily expenses. College students often spend 4-5 years to finish their studies, which costs a lot of money and puts a burden on their family's financial resources. As a result, it is important for students to work a part time job to reduce their debt.  In fact, there has been an increase in the number of students leaving college or university because they don’t have enough money to pay for training fees in recent years. In addition, it is evident that it is hard to earn money in most situations, so earning money during school years also teaches students to understand the true values of money.

In Conclusion, it is clearly evident that students can gain several benefits from working part-time. Apart from getting more practical experiences and earning money to spend on their tuition as well as daily expenses, they can properly develop their time management skills, which, hopefully, prepare them for a good future.

"Is it reasonable to think that undergraduates should have part-time jobs. From my perspective, I agree with this idea because part-time jobs can help students earn money and improve their skills.

First of all, having a part-time job helps students earn money for their daily needs such as food, books, or transportation. This is very useful, especially for students from poor families. They do not need to ask their parents for money all the time. Besides, students can learn to manage their money better when they work and earn by themselves.

Moreover, working part-time allows students to learn important skills such as teamwork, time management, and communication. These skills will help them a lot when they graduate and look for a full-time job. For example, a student who works in a coffee shop will learn how to talk to customers and solve problems quickly.

In conclusion, I believe having a part-time job is good for college students if they know how to manage their time well. It helps them earn money and learn useful skills for their future."
"I firmly agree that college students can greatly benefit from holding a part-time job. First and foremost, working alongside studies cultivates time‑management skills. Balancing class schedules, assignments, and job shifts forces students to plan ahead, prioritize tasks, and avoid procrastination. These organizational abilities not only help them perform well academically, but also become indispensable in future careers where deadlines and multitasking are everyday realities.
Secondly, part‑time employment provides practical experience that complements theoretical learning. For instance, a student majoring in marketing who works as a social‑media assistant gains firsthand insight into audience engagement strategies, analytics tools, and content creation—knowledge that cannot be acquired solely from textbooks. Such on‑the‑job training enhances employability by demonstrating to prospective employers that the student already understands workplace dynamics, teamwork, and customer relations.
Furthermore, earning one’s own income promotes financial responsibility and independence. Managing wages to cover personal expenses—textbooks, transportation, or even emergency costs—teaches budgeting, saving, and wise spending. Students who contribute to their own upkeep tend to value money more and develop a stronger work ethic. At the same time, they learn to distinguish between essential needs and discretionary wants, laying a foundation for sound personal‑finance habits in adulthood.
Of course, it is important that part‑time work does not overwhelm academic commitments. Students should seek positions with flexible hours and clear expectations, and remain mindful of their study load. When selected thoughtfully, however, a part‑time job can be an invaluable complement to college life—sharpening practical skills, fostering maturity, and easing financial pressures, all while enriching the overall educational experience"
"I think that having a part-time job is important for college students. It’s not just about making money, but also about learning many useful things for life.
Firstly, a part-time job helps students learn how to manage their money. When students start earning by themselves, they will understand the value of money. They will think more carefully before spending it on unnecessary things. This habit will be helpful when they graduate and live on their own.
Secondly, students can gain a lot of experience from part-time jobs. They learn how to work with different people, handle problems, and communicate better. These soft skills are very important for future jobs, but they are not usually taught in school. Even simple jobs like working in a coffee shop or bookstore can help students grow their confidence and responsibility.
And, having a job allows students to understand more about the real world. It teaches them that life is not always easy, and success requires hard work. Meeting people from different backgrounds also helps students open their minds.
Of course, students should know how to balance work and study. Studying is still the most important thing. But if students can manage their time well, having a part-time job brings many good things for their future."
"Some people believe that having a part-time job during college is essential for students. However, I disagree with this opinion. In my view, studying should be the top priority for college students, especially in demanding fields like accounting and auditing.
As a senior student majoring in accounting and auditing, I understand how challenging and knowledge-intensive this field is. To truly grasp the lessons taught in class, students must dedicate sufficient time and effort to their studies. In my opinion, a part-time job can distract students from fully focusing on academic goals. For example, important subjects such as financial reporting, auditing standards, and taxation require not only classroom learning but also additional self-study and practice.
Moreover, students in this field often aim to achieve international certifications such as CPA or ACCA. These certifications are highly respected and valuable for future careers, but they require a deep understanding of technical content and significant preparation time. Although I have always wanted to pursue these certifications, I must admit that I have not yet been able to do so, even as a fourth-year student. One of the reasons is that balancing too many commitments would make it harder for me to perform well academically.
In conclusion, while part-time jobs may provide some benefits, I believe that for students in specialized fields like accounting and auditing, focusing on academic excellence and professional certifications is more important. This foundation will offer greater long-term value than temporary work experience."
I agree that having a part-time job is important for college students. Although studying is the main focus in college, working part-time brings many benefits that help students grow and prepare for the future. First, a part-time job teaches time management. Students need to balance their classes, assignments, and work schedules. This helps them become more organized and responsible. These skills are useful not only in school but also in their future careers. Second, working part-time gives students valuable experience. They learn how to work with others, solve problems, and communicate better. This practical experience can make a big difference when they apply for jobs after graduation. Employers often prefer candidates who have some real-world experience. Another important reason is financial support. Many students face money problems during college. A part-time job helps them earn money for tuition, books, or daily expenses. This makes them less dependent on their families and teaches them how to manage money. However, it’s important that the job doesn’t affect their studies. Students should choose jobs with flexible hours that fit their class schedules. If they manage their time well, they can enjoy both working and studying. In conclusion, part-time jobs are very helpful for college students. They offer experience, skills, and money, all of which are useful for personal and career growth. Therefore, I believe college students should have a part-time job.
"Nowadays, skills play an important role for college students. For me, it's important for them to have a part-time job.
First of all, as i have mentioned, having a part-time job help them improve their soft skills, such as communication, problem-solving. While doing their job, their have chance to meet more people to communicate, more circumstantial in real-life and know how to solve them. Moreover, they also can try to teamwork with their colleague, especially when working in customer service role. These skills are not taught in school, so it is important in workspace. Secondly, it help college students earn money for their daily need of their life. They can be no longer depend on their parents, which is good for them. 
Finally, having a part-time job can also help their gain more experience. That means while they doing their job, it helps them gain experience for real, not just on theory. 
In conclude, i totally agree that having a part-time job is necessary for collage student. It brings soft skills, financial and valuable experience for their future. "
"In order to make money while they study, many students today attempt freelancing or launching small businesses. Students from developing nations, who frequently do not receive adequate financial aid for their education, are particularly affected by this. As a result, a lot of them search for part-time work to assist with their bills.

The ability to acquire practical skills for the future is a major justification for students working part-time jobs. They can apply what they learn in class to their real-world jobs. For instance, a marketing student can gain experience dealing with customers and gain a better understanding of business by working part-time at a store or in a small business. Additionally, they make new friends, which will benefit them later on when they're looking for a full-time job.

Part-time employment has the added benefit of fostering students' independence. They can earn their own money rather than constantly begging their parents for it. They become more confident in their decision-making and feel proud as a result. Because it demonstrates their strength and responsibility, people also respect those who can work and study simultaneously.

In conclusion, college students can benefit greatly from working a part-time job. They become more self-reliant, acquire practical experience, and improve their future readiness. Students who work part-time learn how to manage their lives independently and find their true strengths instead of depending solely on their parents.

"I personally agree that having a part-time job is important for college students. Even though it may be hard to balance studying and working, I think it brings more good than harm.

Firstly, doing part-time jobs helps students earn extra money. Many university students have to pay for daily things like food, clothes, or even tuition. With a part-time job, they can reduce the pressure on their parents and feel more independent. For example, I have a friend who teaches English to kids in the evening. He can pay for his rent and phone bill by himself, which is quite impressive.

Secondly, part-time work can give students useful skills. They can learn how to talk with people, manage time, and solve problems. These are real-life skills that are really helpful for the future. When they apply for a full-time job after graduation, they already have some experience, which makes them more confident and stand out from other candidates.

Of course, some students may spend too much time working and forget to study. But I believe that if they plan their schedule well, they can do both.

In conclusion, part-time jobs are helpful for college students. They bring money and experience, and also prepare them better for life after university."
"I agree that It is important for college students to have a part-time job
As a second year college student in university, I think having a partime-job is very important, especially in a higher year. Because inside another income to support parents, It's a chance to push my skills when it is suitable for my major. However, the issue of how to balance working and studying still is a problem. If the student can not solve it, they burn-out easier than others.
I have a friend, she had an internship job at the first year in the university, after 3-month, she approved and became an employee of an agency where related to our marketing major besides being an excellent student in class.. I really admire her and I've also started sending my CV to recruiters until now, I still do not find my job that suitable. 

But I believe that having a partime job prepares us for our careers after graduate. If I have advice for a first year student after me, I will say that they can use the first year to be familiar with the university environment and let’s start sending your CV to have a partime job related to your major and can help you have money.
"
"In my opinion, it is crucial that a part-time job should be included in a university student’s plan. 
First of all, the initial reason for this is that attending the university requires a large amount of resources, including fees such as tuition fee, commuting, food and the most vital one for those living far from home is living cost. These sorts of costs are extremely extortionate for ones who are not having a fully financial condition. Therefore, securing a job would enable them to make ends meet. Moreover, doing a full-time job could deprive students from spending less time for their studying, thereby leading them to terrible grades at school and even failing the exam and paying twice to take the course they failed again. 
However, not everyone should take a part-time job, especially those who don’t have a good health condition. For example, they could easily get sick or can not carry heavy objects.

Lastly, I strongly agree with the point that students in university should have a job to make a living."

"I partly agree with this topic. 
There are so many opportunities for us to make a profit from having a part-time job.First, students can learn how to manage their time better. When they have both classes and a job, they must plan carefully. This helps them become more organized and responsible. These skills are helpful not only in school but also in their future jobs.
Second, a part-time job can help students earn some money. Many students have to pay for books, food, or travel. If they can make their own money, they do not need to ask their parents all the time. This also helps them feel more independent.
In addition, part-time jobs can give students real work experience. They can learn how to work with other people, speak clearly, and solve problems. These are important skills for any job after graduation. Sometimes, students can even find a job in the field they are studying, which is even more helpful.

"Long has been discussed over whether working part-time is beneficial for college students or not. While some people argue that academic pursuit should be prioritized, others claim that part-time employment offer valuable advantages, far beyond immediate financial support.
On one hand, the most tangible benefit of a part-time job is financial gains. For students who grow up in low-income families, they show an inclination towards engaging in income-generating activities. This source of income helps them lighten the financial burden in their family. For those in the middle or high class, the desire for financial support is not that strong, but they seek financial independence and financial management skills in their college years. Beyond immediate needs, the money earned can be allocated to saving, investment, and higher education opportunities, laying a solid foundation for their post-graduation life.
On the other hand, it is also crucial for students to wake up to the fact that there are downsides to reinforcing this idea. The most significant disadvantage is the emphasis on part-time jobs might take a toll on their academic performance. Multitasking between schoolwork and deadlines from work can place undue pressure on individuals, leaving less time for studying, and even poor performance. Furthermore, the employment in part-time jobs which are not aligned with students’ profession and intention seem to be a waste of time. Because these jobs often do not necessitate candidates with a wealth of experience, which has been cultivated in college years.
In conclusion, while academic performance is paramount, the benefits associated with working part-time are undeniable. It is imperative for students to strike a balance between learning commitments and other personal interests, such as part-time employment.

"I partly agree with the idea that college students should have a part-time job.

On the one hand, a part-time job helps students earn extra money. Many students need to pay for daily expenses, books, and sometimes tuition. With a job, they can be more independent and support their families. In addition, students can get real experience from work. They can improve soft skills like communication, teamwork, and time management. These are very useful for their future careers. On the other hand, working part-time takes time and energy. If students work too much, they may feel tired and have less time to study. This can lead to lower grades and stress. Some students cannot balance between studying and working, which can affect their academic life. In my opinion, college students can have a part-time job, but they need to know how to manage their time well. If they have good planning, they can both study and work successfully.

In conclusion, part-time jobs are helpful, but not always suitable for every student. It depends on each person’s situation and ability to balance study and work."
"in todays society "" part time job"" has become an essential part of the rising debate in the present word, including in Vietnam. Many college student choose to work part- time while pursuing their studies. I strong agree that having a part time job during college is important for student. This essay will provide some reasons and relevant examples to support arguments.
Firstly,  it should be recognized part- time jobs provide students with practical experience  that cannot be learned from text books alone. working while studying teaches time management, responsibility, and teamwork. For example, a student working at a café learns to handle customers and word efficiently under pressure. These skill are transferable to many professional settings and give students an edge when they enter the job market after graduation
Another interesting point is that , part time jobs help students become financially independent. College expenses ca be high, including tuition fees, books, and daily living costs. By earning their own money, students can reduce the financial burden on their families and learn how to budget and manage expenses wisely. This financial independence foster a sense of responsibility and maturity.
Finally, balancing work and study prepares students for the realities of adult life. Managing multiple  commitments can be challenging, but it builds resilience and problem-solving skills. Moreover, part-time jobs often allow students to explore career interests, network with professional, and build a resume that impresses future employers.
in conclusion, this essay argued that ""It is important for college students to have a part-time job"". However, everything has two sides and this situation is no exception Therefore, colleges and parents should encourage students to engage in part-time work while studying.

In conclusion, a part-time job has many good points. It helps students grow, learn new skills, and earn money. That is why I think college students should have a part-time job."
"I agree that having a part-time job is important for college students. First of all, having a part-time job helps students earn extra money to pay daily expenses such as food, transportation, or material books. College can be expensive and not all students have enough financial support from their families so a part-time job can relieve some of the pressure. A lot of part -time jobs which college students can try as tutor, waiter, freelancer and so on
Secondly, working part-time allows students to gain real-world experience. They learn how to manage their time, communicate with others and become more responsible. These soft skills are very useful later when they graduate and look for a full-time job. Mostly, employer will be interest in job-seeker who have soft-skill to deal with problems in working environment. 
Finally, having a job helps students understand the value of money and hard work. When you work to earn your own money, you learn how to spend it more wisely.

Although it can be difficult to balance work and study, I believe that having a part-time job during college has more benefits than disadvantages."
"In these days, many college students work part-time jobs while they are studying. It is believed that they should concentrate on their studies while others think it is vital for them to do part-time jobs. In my opinion, I partly agree that having a part-time job is important for college students for several reasons.
On the one hand, doing a part-time job can bring some benefits. Firstly, a part-time job helps students earn extra money. For instance, having a part-time job allow them to cover some the basic needs such as meals, books, and daily living expense. Students can also reduce the financial burden on their families and become more independent. Secondly, when students have part-time jobs, they will gain some soft skills and working experience which will be helpful for them in workplace in their future. To be specific, many employers prefer to hire students who already have working experience, even if it is not related to their major. Part-time jobs also help students develop soft skills like communication, teamwork, and time management.
On the other hand, though doing part-time jobs can help them mitigate the financial pressure, it effects on the students’ academic. In fact, many students spend too much their time to work and not enough time studying, so they will not achieve highly results. In addition, some students may feel too tired after work and have less time or energy to study, do homework, or prepare for exams. At a result, it could be adversely impact on their quality studies.
In conclusion, it is important for college students to have a part-time job. It not only helps them financially but also gives them valuable experience for the future. As long as they manage their time well, part-time jobs can be a positive part of student life"
I agree with the statement. When I went to college, my parents told me that I had to focus on studying not making money. Therefore, I didn’t have any part-time job until my 4th year. But I didn’t graduate on time, so I worked part-time to distract myself. I’m an introvert and haven’t changed at all in my 4-year long period at college – gloomy and never interact with others. When I worked part-time in a coffee shop, the environment changed, I must communicate with my colleges. They inspired me a lot. I realized that it’s not that scary to talk with a stranger or ask someone for help. My family also commented that I smiled more. Although my part-time job has nothing to do with my major, it helped me develop my soft skills and gain some confidence. But everything has its own pros and cons, due to my weak personality, I couldn’t refuse others’ requests though some of them are inconvenient for me and therefore neglected my study. It made me stressed and became insecure. I had to learn how to say no and set my boundaries the hard way. So even though there are some down sides, I still think having a part-time job is important for college students.
"We cannot deny that earning a living is one of the most important goals for a lot of people. However, each period of life has a specific aim. As a result, I believe that it is not too crucial for college students to get a temporary job. In this essay, I will prove my viewpoint clearly.

As students, studying is always a preference because this is the stage that they can absorb knowledge associated with the career they pursue without fear of being timeless. They should spend more time on classes so that they can get the highest mark on tests. Moreover, getting a good score is a plus in CV when they apply for a position after graduating from college.

On the other hand, college students should take part in curriculum activities, instead of working, to improve and enhance their soft skills such as communication skill, problem-solving skill, etc. Additionally, they should take time to enroll in courses involved in their major or join several contests. 

In conclusion, college students can get part-time jobs, but they should have a balance between working and studying. They should make use of student life to experience everything and prepare themselves perfectly before getting into society.
