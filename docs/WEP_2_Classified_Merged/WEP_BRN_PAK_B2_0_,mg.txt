Yes, somewhat because it’s important because it helps with students to get experience and get acclimated to working conditions. It’s also good because it helps with getting some money on the side. But it shouldn’t be too much effort that it takes away time for students to study, or that it becomes a distraction. Even so I think that getting experience might be good to put in a CV. Personally I’ve never pushed myself to get one, but from hearing my friend’s stories it might be really difficult to juggle studies and a job, especially with families asking for help a lot. I think an example could be getting a part-time job as a barista. You would learn ways to make coffee and probably stuff about hospitality since you would work in the food and beverage industry. Another good part-time job could be interning at companies, because you could learn and get hands-on experience in your field. Again I’ve heard stories about interns being asked to do real mundane stuff so it’s a coin toss for whether you would get anything out of it. So conceptually it’s good, but in execution it could be really difficult, since a lot of factors could change your experience.
I agree because not all college students are given incentives such as scholarships that could alleviate potential financial problems while they are attending college. As a college student myself, I understand the problems a college student may face, and the most common problem is finance. Even though I was given a local scholarship, the allowance is not enough to help pay the cost that exceeds the given allowance. One experience was the repair cost of the cooling compartment of my car which cost about $500+ and that was not enough with the allowance I was given. So, my dad helped pay part of the costs and I would have to pay him back with next month’s allowance. Having a part-time job can ease the stress of financial problems. The one advantage is learning how to manage your finances. It’s not too early to learn about managing finances, especially as a college student, we are at the age where we are considered adults and by the time, we have graduated, we would be released to the outside world. Finances is not something to underestimate so it’s better to learn early. Having a part-time job can be a reason to start learning about managing finances especially when given our first paycheck and learning about savings and even potentially how to gain more money for our current self and the future as well.
Acquiring a part-time job as a college student is a decision some students may face in the midst of studenthood. The incentive of part-time jobs for a student is easily the financial perks and experience they gain, but the downside to part-time jobs is the need for discipline to balance out both schoolwork and the part-time job description. It is important for college students to have part time jobs as it teaches students about hard work, introduces students to real-life situations that they will face after graduating, to preventing the ‘culture shock’ factor as they transition from becoming students. However, part-time jobs can also be tiring both physically and mentally. This can lead to other effects on the student’s health such as the feeling of burn-out, not being able to cope with their college studies and workload and losing the or work and school life balance. Overall, it could be argued that to have a part-time job is more ideal – mainly because it teaches the student to gain discipline which could easily cross out factors such as lack of student and work-life balance. Another option might be to take hours off from the part-time job when crucial school dates such as exams are around the corner.
In my opinion, college is when you transition from being a teenager to a young adult for a lot of people, so it is important for college students to have a part-time job to gain experience. It does not have to be specific or related to what they are studying as the experience is not limited to working but also life. I cannot say for those who landed a job through connections, however even getting one has its processes, like stages in life. For example, a student would first need to search for a job depending on their preferences or the situation they are in. Once they found an appropriate one, they would need to apply. Otherwise, send in their resume. If they are noticed, they will need to go through interviews and once they get accepted, they will need to learn the company’s standards of procedure. Another thing is learning how to work with people, like working with the higher-ups, setting up boundaries between coworkers, dealing with diverse types of customers and so on. Having a part-time job while studying may also help with time management as the student would need to plan out their schedule around the classes, assignments, and their shifts. While having a part-time job that is in line with their majors can be beneficial, experience is much more valuable. After all, that is what employers usually seek.
I disagree. Being a college student is already an occupation. The student has to attend classes like lectures and tutorials for many modules. One student can have up to six modules per semester at Universiti Brunei Darussalam. One module will have one lecture and one tutorial every week. That means six modules will have six lectures and six tutorials each week. Each module will have assignments like an oral presentation, written report or essays, and examination. That means for one student, he or she will have six lectures and six tutorials to attend every week and have to find the time to study for assignments. I think that is too much of a workload for one student and being a student, finishing the study is much more important. If the student works for a part-time job, how can they find the time to balance both studying and working? Unless that student is a genius then I think studying is not a daunting task for them. Many students have failed their modules because they don’t attend lectures or tutorials and submit their assignments on time. This is an issue itself. In a course of 20 students, less than 10 will pass the module. Those who failed the module will have to take the same module again in the next semester. Some of those students chose to quit university before graduating because they can’t cope with the workload. So I think that is why having a part-time job is not important while being a college student.
I both agree and disagree on this because there are advantages and disadvantages to having a part-time job while studying at college. Having a part-time job can boost the student’s work experience, social skills, and financial support. With work experience, the student can form a social network for his or her career opportunities after graduating from college. Let’s say that the student worked part-time as a barista, he or she may get another opportunity as a full-time barista at a better coffee shop with a higher salary. Some workplaces present awards to the staff so if the student has a great work performance, he or she may get the award and that can boost the student’s work achievement. The manager or boss of the workplace may suggest better opportunities. Of course money is an important reason why students work part-time so they can support themselves without burdening their parents. The disadvantages of having a job while being a student is the time management and stress from doing so much in a day. The student’s energy can decrease after a day of working and studying and he or she may not get enough rest at night. Balancing both working and studying can also deprive the student of the freedom of hanging out with friends and taking part in extracurricular activities. This can lead to the student feeling burnout and stress because of the overwhelming burden of both working and studying. In conclusion, I cannot decide which one is better but it all depends on the will and determination of the student.
I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Part-time jobs can provide valuable benefits for students. Firstly, part-time jobs offer a practical way for students to gain work experience, which can be an advantage when entering the job market after graduation. Having both real-world experience and academic qualifications makes students more well-rounded and employable. Part-time jobs can also help students develop essential soft skills such as time management, responsibility, and communication, which are crucial in any professional setting. I think that the financial aspect is the most important reason why I agree with the statement. Many students face financial challenges due to the current economy and their monthly allowance is not enough. A part-time job can help lessen some of the burdens of tuition fees, textbooks, transportation, and living expenses. The good thing nowadays is that some websites provide free downloadable PDFs so students do not need to have physical textbooks. The disadvantage of having a part-time job is the effect it has on academic performance and student well-being. Students need to make sure that their part-time job does not interfere with their education. Completing their education should be their primary focus so it is important that the students must not work excessively. That way they can have a balance of work hours and study hours.
No. I disagree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. College students have a lot of studying and assignments to complete before the end of each semester. Depending on the programme of study, different students have different lengths of study. Studying, completing assignments, and preparing for the final exam can be stressful and require hours of focus and dedication. If students have jobs while they are still attending college, they may have less hours to spend on their studies and their personal resting time. Students also need a lot of rest and peer support to help with their studies, and having jobs could take that personal time and support away. Rather than having jobs, I think that having a balance between studying and personal time is much more important. Students should dedicate themselves to activities that they find enjoyable, relaxing, or fulfilling, such as hobbies, exercise, reading, meditation, or simply resting. Personal time is important for maintaining a healthy college-life balance, reducing stress, and improving overall well-being. If the students have to work in addition to attending college, they won’t be able to find quality time to decompress each day because both studying and working can be stressful and tiring. Although having a job has its benefits such as earning money, time management skills, communication skills, and work experience, students must have a strong mentality to be able to work and study at the same time. It is not easy but many have successfully done it, and it is also okay to do one thing at a time and prioritise health and well-being.
I would say that I’m neutral on this because of many reasons. First, while it is important for college students to have a part-time job if they need extra money, they also must be able to balance studying and working. Attending university requires money for car fuel, food, stationeries, and other important items like a laptop. Second, while having a work experience is important for when the students apply for jobs after they graduate, juggling between working and studying can be overwhelming and stressful. The students may not have personal free time to escape work or their assignments. If they have upcoming exams, that will be even more stressful. Some employers at part-time jobs may not let the students be absent from work just because of having exams. I think it would be much better if the students can find flexible jobs that suit their schedules. Third, having a part-time job gives the students life skills and knowledge that they won’t acquire from studying at college. These skills depend on where they work. If the students really enjoy working at their jobs, they may think that the skills they obtain from college are not necessary. They may decide to quit college all of a sudden and that means they won’t receive a qualification of higher education. Based on these reasons, I would say that the students must be able to juggle both attending college and working for them to be successful at both. If they can’t do that, it is okay to focus on one occupation at a time.
I totally agree that it is super important for college students to have a part-time job. Having a job helps students learn so many essential skills, become more independent, and manage their time better. First off, part-time jobs give students real-life experience that they can't get just from studying. For example, working in customer service or retail teaches them how to communicate well, solve problems, and work as a team – skills they will need for any future job. They also learn how to handle tough situations, deal with difficult customers, and adapt to different work environments. This gives them confidence and makes them better prepared for life after college. Having a part-time job also helps students become more financially independent. When they earn their own money, they can pay for things like textbooks, transportation, and fun activities without always relying on their parents or getting into debt. It is a great way for them to learn how to budget and manage their money wisely, which sets them up for success later on. Lastly, juggling work and studies helps students get really good at managing their time. They learn how to plan carefully, prioritize their tasks, and make sure they meet their work and academic commitments. This will be super valuable for them in their future careers, where they will need to meet deadlines, work with others, and keep a healthy work-life balance.
I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job to gain work experience. Studying at college is the final step before entering the real world of working, so having part-time jobs can prepare for that transition. This experience is not just about building professional skills for their resume, but also about personal growth. Personal growth is the experience of being independent and responsible and developing crucial skills such as time management and money saving. I realize that the job search process can be challenging, and even landing a job through personal connections involves its own set of experiences that parallel those of life. It can be daunting to search for a job and go through the application and interview process. Once hired, there is a lot to learn. It is not going to be just about the job itself but also about interpersonal skills and time management while juggling work and studies. I believe that having a part-time job can provide an important experience that employers value regardless of its relevance to one's major at college. It is important for students to remember that they are not alone in navigating the journey from college to the professional world.
I agree because not every college student is lucky enough to get scholarships or other financial help to ease the burden while they are in college. As I was a fee-paying student myself, I understand how tough it can be to save money for my own needs and to pay my tuition fee. Although my parents helped pay the fees at the beginning so I could attend university, they also taught me to work to pay them back little by little. So I had to work part-time to earn money so I can pay my parents back slowly. Apart from paying the tuition fee, I had to save money for car repairs and food. Luckily I never had to pay for anything or buy other necessities throughout my undergrad years. One of the best things about having a part-time job as a student is that it pushes you to start managing your money and teaches you to be responsible. It’s never too early to get a grip on your finances, especially when you’re in college and starting to take on more adult responsibilities. I’m grateful that my parents taught me early to act like adults, such as dealing with bills, rent, and everything else that comes with being independent because that’s how it is in the real world. Another thing is that I’m lucky that I could always find the time to study for assignments and exams so my academic performance was not affected even though I had to work. I was able to attend lectures and tutorials because I managed my own schedule. My free time was spent on studying and revising for exams.
