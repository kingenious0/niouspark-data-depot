"Nowadays, people have a very high knowledge about health. So that, they tend to have a very serious attitude when other people do some negative effects for their health. Base on that opinion, I completely agree with the sentence: cigarettes should be seriously banned at all the restaurants in our country.
Firstly, restaurants are places where have diversity kind of people, from all generations. Children and elderly are kinds of people really easy to be hurt, and need to be protected. Definitely, smoking can destroy deeply their lung although they are not someone who directly smoke. 
Secondly, restaurants do not just sale food but they also provide some services, for example: atmosphere, music, place for eating and so on. And having the smoke of the cigarettes can make the atmosphere becomes terrible with some clients, they can have some complaints about that.
Besides, a solution for the restaurants is to have a private place for someone who smoking. It can solve problems from smoking people and also help the restaurants do not have to band their customers.  
In conclusion, we all know that smoking is something not good in society so It should be unacceptable in restaurants. Although smoking has many weaknesses but we also can have solution for it. 
"I have some reasons to disagree and agree with the topic do not servicing smoking at all restaurants in the country.
First, if some people are having trouble in their lungs, they can eat the outside. The restaurant can be serviced to them. Second, the finances of a restaurant can be low-down. The restaurants can collaborate with some brands to produce smoke or something like that, if we do not service something like that, we can lose a lot of money from the brands and the people using the service in the restaurant. So for all reasons, I disagree do not being serviced at all restaurants in the country.
However not serviced at all restaurants in the country is a good suggestion to improve health. If a family has some children go to the restaurant to accept smoking. Children can be coughing and snowing. Second, when teenagers see a man or woman smoking, they will do that. It is a bad mirror for teenagers. And people should not do it.
So serviced smoking at all restaurants has a lot of advantages and disadvantages. When people go to restaurants, I believe that they want to enjoy the food and background, good atmosphere, not smoking. "
I think that is a good idea when smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, and I strongly agree with this idea. The first reason is about the heath of the human in the restaurants. Smoking is going to affect badly for the health of the people smoke and the others people in the restaurants. Specially, the smoke will strongly affect to the development of children in the restaurants. The second reason is about the view inside the restaurants. Smoke in the air cause the customers in the restaurants feel really badly. They can see the view and it leads to their experience to be badly. After that, they will give the bad comments for the manager and they aren’t going to go to this restaurant. The last reason is about inside your mouth. Some research in the world about the effect of smoke to the smell of mouth. They proved the effect from the smoke to the smell of mouth is true. Therefore, I think the restaurants can build a room for people use to smoke. Because, some people addict to smoke and they can live without smoking. All in all, I think smoking is not good and it should be banned at all the restaurants in the country.
"I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are several compelling reasons to support this stance. Firstly, banning smoking in restaurants protects public health. Secondhand smoke is harmful to both smokers and non-smokers, and it can cause a range of health issues, including respiratory problems, heart disease, and cancer. By prohibiting smoking in restaurants, we can ensure that all patrons and staff are not exposed to these dangerous toxins. For example, in countries where smoking bans in public places have been implemented, there has been a significant reduction in hospital admissions for heart attacks and respiratory conditions. Secondly, a smoke-free environment improves the dining experience. The smell of smoke can be unpleasant and off-putting, especially when people are trying to enjoy their meals. Non-smoking customers are more likely to frequent restaurants that do not allow smoking, which can increase the establishment's clientele and revenue. For instance, many restaurants in cities with smoking bans have reported increased patronage and customer satisfaction. Thirdly, enforcing a smoking ban in restaurants is relatively straightforward and can be effectively regulated. Clear signage, designated smoking areas outside the restaurant, and strict penalties for violations can ensure compliance. This approach has been successfully implemented in many countries and cities, demonstrating that it is both practical and beneficial. In conclusion, smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants to protect public health, enhance the dining experience, and ensure a pleasant environment for everyone. The benefits of such a ban far outweigh any potential drawbacks, making it a necessary step for the well-being of community.

I agree. Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Because smoking is not healthy and do my go to the doctor. Firsthand foremost, smoking increases the risk of lung cancer, heart disease, and repertory problems. It damages the lungs, making it difficult for individuals to breathe and leading to chronic obstructive pulmonary diseas.the chemicals in tobacco smoke can also cause strokes and increase. Many restaurant, they are very dislike smoking, it is diffical for everyone. Especially pregnant woman it dangerous to healthy and baby. Smoking is a very insensitive behavior, not only affects the respiratory and cardiovascular systems but also wreaks havoc on one is overall health. It can lead to various types of cancer. Additionally, it can result in dental problems such as gum disease and tooth loss. The financial burden of smoking is substantial as well. Smoking spend a significant amount of money on cigarettes, which could otherwise be used for better purposes. Health care costs related to smoking-related illnesses also place a heavy strain on healthcare systems. In summary, smoking is a dangerous habit that can lead to numerous health problems and is detrimental not only to the smoker but also to those around that needs to be addressed with education, support, and resources for those looking to quite.
"In spite of hating smoking very much, I still think it is not necessary to ban smoking at every restaurant in my nation. 
Smoking is harm for people who use it and people around them, especially for pregnant. It affects their economy, in restaurants it can affect the taste and smell of other people, a biggest harm everyone can see is problem about lung and health. Governments did a lot of thing to reduce amount of smoking-person, such as rising fax, but they never strictly ban it. First, it can be difficult for them because there is not everyone smoking can give up this, it will be not comfortable when they can not use it for a long time. Using smoke is harmful, but it still brings some small benefits, like reducing stress or be warmer. Banning completely is unequally to them, like we acting with a villain. Second, the separate area for smoking is enough to them. It is good for all, they can smoke and not harm to anyone. Third, the smoking-person takes a big percent of people, banning all can make them not comfortable and so on, they do not go outside for eating and then, the annual money of restaurant can go down.
To include, we do not have to ban all smoking. Instead, we should be more sympathize and remind if some one smoke in improper place."
"Nowadays, smoking in public places, especially in restaurants, has been a controversial issue for years. Many countries have already imposed bans on smoking in indoor spaces. I agree with this statement. Smoking in public places like restaurant should be banned because of some reasons.

First of all, smoking in restaurants poses serious health risks to both smokers and non-smokers. For non-smokers including the children and older people, smoking leads to problems about the environment because it is very dangerous for many people's health when they sit near the smokers.

Secondly, banning smoking in restaurant protects the environment. The restaurant's atmosphere will become fresher and more peaceful. By prohibiting smoking, restaurants can maintain a cleaner space and attract customers. A smoking ban ensures a healthier environment for everyone in the public places.

Last but not least, banning smoking in the restaurant is very important because it not only improves their product quality but also improves the environment. I hope many countries can ban smoking in the restaurant and other public places. 

Ịn conclusion, smoking in the restaurant is very dangerous, so we must ban smoking to protect any health for everyone and the environment. It is very useful for the present and the future."
