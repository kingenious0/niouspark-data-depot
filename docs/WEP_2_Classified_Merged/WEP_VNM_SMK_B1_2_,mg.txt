I will express my opinion on whether smoking should be banned in restaurants in different countries.I completely agree with the above viewpoint .Banning smoking in restaurants is a crucial measure to protect public health and create a healthy dining environment. When people smoke, cigarette smoke containing harmful substances like nicotine, carbon monoxide, and other carcinogenic chemicals spreads in the air, harming both smokers and those around them. Non-smokers who inhale secondhand smoke are at higher risk of respiratory diseases, cardiovascular issues, and cancer. Children and the elderly are particularly vulnerable to the effects of cigarette smoke. Prohibiting smoking in restaurants not only protects the health of customers but also the employees working there.A smoke-free environment will be cleaner and more comfortable, allowing diners to enjoy their meals without worrying about cigarette smoke. By creating smoke-free environments, countries can significantly reduce healthcare costs associated with smoking-related illnesses and improve overall air quality . Additionally, this policy encourages people to quit smoking, thereby reducing the smoking rate in the community. Banning smoking in restaurants is a necessary policy that should be enforced worldwide to protect human health and improve the quality of life.Smoking is very harmful to your health, so quit smoking to avoid affecting the good health of yourself and your family.Appreciate your health before cigarette smoke affects you.
"I strongly agree that smoking should be not allowed at all restaurants in the country. First and foremost, smoking poses significant health risks to both smokers and non-smokers. Secondhand smoke exposure can cause serious health issues, such as respiratory problems, heart disease, and even cancer. For instance, employees working in a smoking-permitted restaurant are at a higher risk of developing these health problems due to constant exposure. 

Moreover, banning smoking in restaurants creates a more pleasant dining environment for all customers. The smell of smoke can be unappetizing and bothersome, detracting from the overall dining experience. A family with children may avoid dining out if they know the restaurant allows smoking, thereby impacting the business negatively. By implementing a smoking ban, restaurants can attract a wider range of customers who appreciate a smoke-free environment.

Additionally, a smoking ban in restaurants promotes a healthier lifestyle and encourages smokers to reduce or quit smoking. Public policies that restrict smoking in certain areas have been shown to decrease smoking rates. Based on a large number of scientific research results, countries that have implemented smoking bans in public places have observed a decline in smoking prevalence among their populations.

In conclusion, completely banning smoking in all restaurants in the country is essential for protecting public health, enhancing the dining experience, and encouraging healthier habits. It is a necessary step towards creating a healthier and more enjoyable environment for everyone."
"In recent years, there are some concerns about the act of allowing people to smoke in restaurants, leading some ideas that it should be completely banned. In my opinion, there are some other ways to avoid the harmfulness of smoking to people in restaurants but do no need to ban it completely. 
On the one side, smoking is definitely harmful to human’s health, which can make it being considered not good for restaurant environments. For example, it can cause people suffering from many lung diseases, especially lung cancer, one of the most leading causes of deaths worldwide. Additionally, some people might have some types of immune disorders, making them sensitive to smoke and trigger many serious reactions in a smoking environment. Lastly, smoking in restaurants could put some significant risks of causing fires there, which is definitely not a good news for anyone.
On the other side, there are several ways to avoid the effects of smoking in restaurants, without banning it completely. For instance, the restaurants’ owners can change the way they design rooms for their restaurants, by making specific areas for people to come there and smoke. Additionally, there should be some fire alarming systems to control and reduce the impacts of fires that might possibly occur while someone smoke. 
In conclusion, in spite of the harmfulness of smoking to human health, there are still several ways to prevent it from affecting people in the restaurants. Therefore, I think there should be some policies and changes to the ways of managing restaurants and control smoking without even banning it completely.

"In today’s society, there is a social prejudice about the smoking in public areas such as restaurant, hotel…. Although some people suppose that it should be fully restricted to smoke in restaurant, the other still allow this activity. From my perspective, I agree that it should be limited but to a certain extent, and the following essay will state some reasons to support my viewpoint.
Regarding the health aspect of populations, smoking in the restaurants may detrimentally affect mental and physical well being. According to other research, our respiratory system can be damaged with the smoke from cigar, potentially people are more at risk of several illness, such as sore throat, asthma,....Particularly, restaurants may serve a range of customers from all ages, including the elderly, adults, and even babies in which some of they are allergic to the smoke. 
However, I’m more opposed to the opinion that it should completely eliminate smoking activities in those formal places. In some cases, restaurant may have a specific room for the smokers since it helps them to relieve their stress after a day of hard work. Besides, several eating places have been constructed in the opening atmosphere which not obviously affect surrounded customers. 
In conclusion, I concur that smoking in restaurant should be limited but not completely eradicated due to several reasons. Therefore, the restaurant should spend little spaces as smoking area to mitigate the effect of smoking on other customers. "
"Health-conscious is one of the most significant concerns nowadays when everything has been operated in a rapid pace of digital era. Some people opine that cigarettes industry should be eliminated to bring back a healthy world. However, I do not have the same idea for 3 main reasons.
To commence with, it is factual that a phenomenon just becomes detrimental it has been over-abused over a long period of time, not apart from the existence of addictants. The pristine purpose of producing cigarettes is as a stress reduction substance and that value of it has still continued till recent days. In fact, there is no survey saying that life expectancy of a person will be affected if they just take 2 or 3 cigarettes a month. What’s more, the right amount of usage will stimulate working efficiency and maintain stable emotion. Secondly, the action of banning a product is not as easy as saying, it is actually relevant to a whole industry and rate of employment. If this decision is made internationally valid, millions of citizens will lose their job, leading to the degradation of economy and the strike in protests on a large scale. Finally, it is psychologically true that putting restriction is incline to resulting in opposite consequences. For example, going along the street of Viet Nam, you can easily catch some banning signs of throwing rubbish at the corner of somewhere, but instead of the maintance of a clean and fresh area, they have a full of trash piling up like a mountain. 
To conclude, I totally on the other side of this argument. However, I do think that the government should issue some restrictions on the amount of using or legal places to smoke for a civilized and controlled community. "
"I totally agree with the idea of banning smoking at all the restaurants in the country. 
First of all, the action of smoking itself is a risk for many chronic cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases such as: hypertension, dyslipidemia, aortic coarctation, Chronic obstruction pneumonia disease that is known as COPD, pulmonary cancer, and some researches recently prove that children inactively smoke by living with a smoking person will have more risk of having wheezes, women can have a more dangerous gestation by actively smoking. Understanding of the disadvantages of smoking, it is everyone’s duty to prevent this action.
Secondly, restaurants are considered as public places, so if one smoke, everyone in the same room with him or her will be actively smoked, including children, women with the possibility of having a gestation, or people having pulmonary diseases. Inactive smoking is a real thing, the risk of developing chronic diseases from smoking is the same for the actively smoking and inactively smoking person. If all the restaurants in the country ban smoking, the restaurant will obviously have fresher and healthier air for everyone. 
Finally, it is a social’s duty to prevent smoking. The restriction of smoking in all restaurants will be a strong message for everyone to have more concern thoughts about the disadvantages of smoking, and inspire people to have more actions on preventing smoking in the future.  "
"In Vietnam, it is a common fact that smoking is harmful to people’s health. Thus, a mass majority of people reject the use of cigarettes in public places, for example, restaurants. In this essay, I will demonstrate an endorsement of the policy of total smoking restriction at all restaurants nationwide. 
Regarding health, smoking is the major reason for severe diseases, most typically lung cancer. Cigarettes consist of numerous components, including nicotine, a detrimental chemical that causes cancer. There have been reports on the increase in cases related to lung cancer throughout the world. This could result from the early use of cigarettes among youngsters. Therefore, the use of cigarettes should be moderated.
Cigarettes are not only harmful for smokers but also for individuals who accidentally inhale. Public places, such as restaurants, have a huge number of people gathering around. With only a sufficient amount of smoke escaping from the cigarettes could induce negative impacts to the crowd nearby. So, the act of completely banning smoking is highly necessary for the safety and the consolidation of public health. 
In short, I agree that smoking should be eliminated for the reasons mentioned above. By doing so, the world could witness a decrease in lung cancer, and community health would be ensured and protected."
"At the present, smoking is becoming a main problem happening all around the world. The majority of the store sell the tobacco. Whether smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants is a topic that generates significant debate. Here’s some opinion of the arguments on both sides:
On the first hand, exposure to secondhand smoke can cause serious health issues, including respiratory problems, heart disease, and cancer. Banning smoking in restaurants protects non-smokers, including children, pregnant women, and employees, from these risks.
On the second hand, restaurant staff are particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of secondhand smoke due to their prolonged exposure in the workplace. 
However, it consisted many personal freedom. Adults should have the right to choose whether to smoke or not. Some argue that as long as there are designated smoking areas that do not affect non-smokers, smoking should be allowed.
In conclusion, I personally agree that smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants. While it is important to consider personal freedom and business rights, these can be addressed through designated smoking areas outside of restaurants, ensuring that the indoor dining experience remains safe and enjoyable for everyone. The health and welfare of the general public should take consideration in order to protect the space green, properly and beautiful. "
"It is said that completely banning smoking in all restaurants in the country is necessary for many reasons. Such a ban would significantly enhance public health, make dining out more enjoyable, and keep up with modern health standards. So, I strongly agree with the above statement. 

Firstly, a no smoking environment is much better for health. Smoke from cigarette is harmful and can cause serious health problem like lung disease and heart issues. When smoking is allowed in restaurants, both customers and staff are faced with these dangers. By banning smoking, we would protect everyone from the harmful effects of smoke, leading to better public health.
Secondly, banning smoke would make dining out more pleasant. Restaurants should be enjoyable places to eat, but smoke can make it uncomfortable. It can affect the state of food, make the air unpleasant, and annoy customers. A no smoking restaurant would ensure a more enjoyable experience for everyone. For example, when I go to the restaurant, I want to have time with my friends, my family, but everyone can be disturbed by smoke. We have to choose a separate area, so we are not really enjoy this moment together. 
Finally, a nationwide smoking ban in restaurants would show that we are keeping up with how other places handle health. Many countries have already made this change to improve health standards. 
In summary, banning smoke in all restaurants would protect health, enhance the dining experience, and keep up with modern health standards."
"It is proposed that smoking should be prohibited from all the restaurants nationally. Personally, I am an advocate of this proposal for a number of reasons.

First of all, it is no doubt that the smoke of any kind of cigarettes is harmful to human. At the restaurants, there are many people of various ages including toddlers and young children. If smoking was allowed, it would be extremely harmful for the kids’ health. Not only that, many people including adults are allergic to the smoke of cigarettes. This can make them feel ill and sometimes even vomit inside the restaurants.

Second, the smoke of cigarettes can interfere the taste of the dishes in the restaurants. People go to the restaurants in order to enjoy the taste of delicious and nutritious dishes. If there is someone starting to smoke, the smoke can affect the taste of other guests’ dishes and even the atmosphere of the restaurants. 

Finally, smoking in a restaurant could sometimes cause fire. This is a rare situation; however, it still can happen. Therefore, it would cause a lot of damage for humans and possessions.

In conclusion, considering the all the above mentioned reasons, I believe that smoking of any kind should be completed prohibited at all the restaurants in the country. "
"Some people express their opinion that smoking is harmful, and it is important that smoking be banned at all restaurants in the country. I would argue that smoking should be banned, but such changes would be too radical.
Smoking is harmful not only to the smoker but also for the people around them.  For example, smoking in public releases smoke that affects the health of the smokers and causes other people who inhale the smoke to be sick. Other people who are of no business would be affected by the smoke. In many developed countries (e.g. Japan, the US), dining places either ban smoking altogether or establish separate spaces for smokers, as many people argue that it is unfair that non-smokers are indirectly harmed by the acts of smokers. It is imperative that smoking be banned in restaurants around the country. But, at the same time, those changes should take place in a step-by-step manner. The first thing that we should do is to actively campaign against smoking and raise awareness. Secondly, governments should introduce legislation that requires smoking to be banned in public places and set up smoking areas in public places. When public awareness of smoking is of an appropriate level, only then can governments ban smoking in public places, restaurants altogether. By employing a constructive approach to banning smoking, governments can ensure that the banning is well received and successfully implemented.
In conclusion, I am of the argument that smoking be banned in eateries and restaurants, for its detrimental effect to the smokers and the public, but the banning per se should be implemented constructively. While smokers are allowed to smoke, it is unfair that the act of smoking affects non-smokers. Thus, it is important to ban smoking constructively to protect the public from smoking."
"Nowadays, most people have a habit of smoking, and it is gradually rejuvenating to young people, not as middle-aged as before, most of them are dragged into these evils. I have also encountered cases where people casually smoke in public places and in restaurants and bars. This is not good at all, so I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.

Smoking in restaurants is not normal as people think, because the restaurant has all classes, everyone is at risk of infection with unnecessary problems with smoke, in addition to smoke. The drug affects more people inhaled more to the sucker, affecting the elderly, young children and pregnant women more than that. 

Smoking in restaurants causes loss of traditions and affects the reputation of that restaurant, so each restaurant needs its own measures to prevent this continued, can be banned or built. So a separate smoking room, but for me to build a separate smoking room is not optimal because they may not go there to breathe each other's smoke? So for me, it should be completely banned from smoking in restaurants, a luxurious, romantic space with candles and flowers that cannot let smoke destroy all. So each person has a unique point of view and no one is like anyone, maybe I think so, but some people think differently.

In short, everything has two opposing thoughts and it depends on how you think. But with this topic, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
"
"Some people believe that smoking at restaurants is not a problem, others think that is not good, but in my point of view, I totally agree with the above view. In this day and age, smoking is an alarming issue, because it not only affects the health of smokers, but smoke also has a significant impact on people around them. Therefore, smoking in the restaurant should be completely banned.

The restaurant is home to many people, smoking in the restaurant will affect many people, not only makes customers uncomfortable by smoke, but it also affects children and pregnant women when They come to the restaurant. Besides, it also seriously affects the experience of eating, other customers will feel unhappy when they are eating with the smell of toxic smoke. Completely banning smoking in the restaurant will protect the health of both customers and store staff, creating a clean and safe environment for everyone to experience eating here. That not only increases the economy of the restaurant but also creates a good reputation when there is protection to customer health.

I think the restaurant should have actions to protect the health of people, improve the message of non-smoking and create a clean and safe environment to the health of customers."
"Smoking is known as a harmful habit of many people in society. Banning smoking in restaurant has been a hot topic of discussion for many years. In my opinion, I agree with the reasons why smoking should be completely prohibited. 

To begin with, smoking should be banned due to its negative impact on health and environment, over dining experiences for restaurant's customers. Smoke contains many harmful chemicals that can cause serious diseases such as heart problems and lung cancer for human. Non-smokers, children and pregnant women, even restaurant staff that are exposed to these dangers when smoking is allowed in public place. In addition, the smell of cigarette smoke can be unpleasant for the dining experience for non-smokers. By banning smoking, restaurants would be fresher, more enjoyable environment leading to increased business and customer satisfaction.

Moreover, cigarette smoke not only affects human health but also contributes to the environmental pollution. Smoke lingers in the air, making it difficult to breathe and reduce the quality of atmosphere. Banning smoking sets a good example for younger generations by promoting clean air and healthy habits. Over time, such measures can lead to a decline in smoking-related diseases and pollution environment. 

The benefits of banning smoking in restaurant outweigh the drawbacks. Public health should be prioritized so people should be more aware of the harmful effects of smoking for individuals and society.   "
