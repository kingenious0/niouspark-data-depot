I disagree with this statement. Although I agree that smoking is injurious to health, I feel that individuals should be able to have a separate space for smoking. This is because individuals who smoke, would want these facilities to be there when they visit a restaurant. This not only gives them an opportunity to be comfortable in their own space, but also protects those who are non-smokers. Moreover, having this allocated space could also be a reason for these individuals to visit these restaurants. This could give the restaurant a driving force for revenue and also give them an additional opportunity to cater to this demography of the population. Although it could be an idea that not all restaurants would need to allow smoking, some, or those who chose to could do it. Banning creates a situation where people must be provided with an alternative but if it is not provided, then there could be a case where people are forced to find places to smoke in public, which are not suitable or might cause others discomfort. Lastly, banning will always lead to resistance, therefore, other policies which influence people to smoke in an area where non-smokers are not impacted, should be implemented.
 Some people argue that smoking should be banned in restaurants. And I strongly agree with that argument.
Every new-generation restaurant has separate rooms for smokers. Smoking has become a very common part of life. And the restaurant owners played their part in normalizing smoking. In every country, a good number of people smoke on a daily basis. Smokers usually feel the real craving after lunch or dinner. So restaurants keep a smoking zone to increase their service. These days, restaurants are using fancy designs and making their smoking areas more attractive for smokers. Because of these things, teenagers might think that smoking is a cool trend to follow. Restaurant owners might not know that, but they are promoting smoking directly to their customers. It can ruin a family. Smoking should be banned in restaurants. Because not only does it attract chain smokers but also potential smokers. Smoking in restaurants can also spread a bad smell throughout the restaurant. Restaurants can be a very suffocating place to be when the bad smell spreads. It won't be good for the business as well. Taking all these into condsideration, restaurants of any nature should be smoke-free places where families can go with their children. 
 I absolutely agree with the notion that smoking should be prohibited in all restaurants around the country. This position is supported by solid evidence.

To begin with, smoking offers substantial health concerns not only to smokers but also to nonsmokers who are exposed to secondhand smoke. We can create a healthier and safer atmosphere for everyone by outlawing smoking in restaurants. According to studies, secondhand smoke contains a variety of hazardous compounds that can cause respiratory difficulties, heart disease, and even cancer. Smoking bans in restaurants will help safeguard both customers and restaurant employees from the risks of tobacco smoke.

Second, smoking in restaurants not only harms people's health but also degrades the overall eating experience. Cigarette smoke can be obtrusive and unpleasant for nonsmokers, causing discomfort and unhappiness. Furthermore, the odor of smoking can linger on clothing and impact the flavor of food, reducing the enjoyment of dining out. Restaurants can create a more comfortable and inclusive environment for all patrons by prohibiting smoking.

Furthermore, a complete prohibition on smoking in restaurants is consistent with the global trend of encouraging smoke-free settings. Many countries and towns have already enacted similar prohibitions in response to the harmful consequences of smoking on public health. By following suit, we may help to reduce smoking-related ailments and create a healthier society as a whole.
Some may argue that people have the right to smoke and that prohibiting smoking in restaurants violates such rights. However, it is critical to emphasize public health and the well-being of the majority. The detrimental impact of secondhand smoke on others outweighs the individual's freedom to smoke in public places.

To summarize, a comprehensive ban on smoking in all restaurants across the country is critical to protecting public health and improving the eating experience. 
 Smoking is a very common thing in every country across the world. Some like smoking, while others don't. It is a very personal choice and nobody is bothered if the other person is smoking or not, unless it's someone's parents or their significant half. However, in a country like Bangladesh, smoking is very common and people can be seen smoking in the open.
However, I don't think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. As long as the non-smokers are not disturbed by the smokers, it seems okay to smoke in a restaurant because most restaurants have a separate space for smokers and non-smokers. Some people visit specific restaurants because they can't smoke in the open or at their home, so they visit these particular restaurants to smoke. This also helps the restaurant in some way, as they have to buy food as well besides smoking in a separate space.
For example: I am a non-smoker, I don't like cigarette smoke around my food. If anyone smokes cigarette while I am having food, this will automatically irritate me and I will never visit that restaurant again. However, If I am having my food separately, and the smoker is enjoying smoking in cigarette in a different corner then I don't see any problem here. So, I disagree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. 
 Restaurant business is one of the most rapidly growing industry right now in our country. In every other corner we see a café or a restaurant.  From teen agers to millennials everyone often visits a restaurant. A common thing in these modern restaurants is almost every one of them has a smoking zone in there. Now, smoking as we all know is injurious to health and environment. But this is something that cannot be controlled overnight. There is no such law in our country where one cannot smoke publicly. The café and restaurant owners grabbed this opportunity with both hands and to attract more customer they provided a smoking zone. I am a nonsmoker but I often see smokers tend to have a cigarette with their coffee or having a cigarette after their meal. It is a very common practice for them. But there are other people in the restaurants as well specially kids. This can be very harmful for them. I believe that the smoking zone in a restaurant should not be in an open place where other customers will get affected. It should be in a separate place.
So, in my opinion restaurants can have a smoking zone but in a place where the other customers will not get affected. 
 
 I am strongly agree with the agreement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because of the health issue of the people.
First of all, restaurants are the public place where every age of people go for eat and drink. Smoking effects the smokers and the others also the childrens. Smoking causes cancer to the people who smokes and also the people who don't smoke but staying with the smokers. Smoking causes same health issues for both smokers and non smokers. Smoking can make the restaurants unhigenic and it can also make the environment of the restaurants unstable.
On the other hand, if the people smoke openly in the restaurants it can make the environment of the place unstable and uhigenic. The children cant be go to the restaurants if the people smoke their because smoke causes health issue to others also. Non smoker people don't go to the restaurant where people smoke openly. Nowadays people are more aware of health hazards that's why it will create a bad reputations for the restaurant. Restaurants will also lose a huge number of customer who don't smoke which will decrease their revenue.
In conclusion, Smoking should be banned in all the restaurants in the country for the sake of the people's health and safety.
 
 The ever-present debate about smoking in restaurants needs a blanket prohibition across Bangladesh. Several factors explain this viewpoint, including the importance of public health and consumer happiness.

To emphasize public health, a smoking ban in restaurants must be implemented. Active smokers and those exposed to secondhand smoke are at risk of developing respiratory ailments, cardiovascular difficulties, and long-term health issues. Bangladesh may preserve the well-being of restaurant guests and workers by preventing smoking, supporting healthier lifestyles, and lowering the strain on healthcare services.

A smoke-free eating atmosphere improves the overall dining experience for all customers. Nonsmokers may enjoy their meals without pain or exposure to bad scents, resulting in a welcoming environment. Restaurants in Bangladesh can provide a more sanitary environment by enacting a prohibition.

Improved air quality, lower smoking rates, and more public knowledge of the dangers of smoking are all effects of smoking bans in public areas, including restaurants. The effectiveness of these programs will illustrate the achievable goal and upside of installing a countrywide smoking prohibition in restaurants.

As a result, a complete restriction on smoking in restaurants across Bangladesh is required to preserve public wellness and improve the eating experience. Accepting a smoke-free restaurant atmosphere encourages healthier choices and demonstrates Bangladesh's dedication to its population's health. 
       I disagree with the proposal that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. We all know smoking is very harmful to one's health. It causes severe respiratory problems. Cigarette contains nicotine, which increases our heartbeat rate and blood pressure. In the long run, nicotine increases the possibility of heart attack. Smoking cigarette causes cancer. When a person smokes a cigarette, the smoke is exposed in the environment. As a result, people around the smoker also inhale nicotine and toxic chemicals. So, it is very unfair to the non-smokers as they are exposed to nicotine involuntarily. Therefore, public smoking should be banned.                                                  However, smoking cigarettes is a serious addiction. An addict cannot get rid of his addiction so easily. It is a long and painful process. A lot of smokers go to restaurants everyday. If smoking is banned in all the restaurants, many of those smokers might stop coming to the restaurants. We cannot be that naïve to hope that banning smoking in restaurants will cause the smokers to leave smoking. In fact, the restaurants might rather lose a lot of customers. The best possible solution to this problem is to create a separate 'Smoking zone' in the restaurants for smokers. In this way, the non-smokers will be safe from the hazards of nicotine. Rather than issuing a strict ban, chain smokers should be rehabilitated and passive smokers should be discouraged. This is the process through which I think this issue should be handled.
 Smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants nationwide to protect public health, create a smoke-free environment and promote a more enjoyable dining experience for all.

 Firstly , a complete ban on smoking in restaurants is essential to protect public health. Smoking in restaurants exposes staff and other guests to these toxic substances, increasing the risk of respiratory disease, heart disease and other health problems. By enacting a smoke-free environment, restaurants can ensure a healthier environment for all and reduce the potential long-term health effects.

Secondly , banning smoking in restaurants helps create a smoke-free environment.. People with respiratory disease, allergies and smoking sensitivities may be particularly affected, which may cause discomfort or even refuse to eat out. The restaurant's non-smoking environment ensures that all guests can enjoy their meals without being exposed to dangers.

 Additionally, implementing a 100% smoke-free restaurant policy can have a positive impact on public perception and attract a wider customer base. Many people, especially families with children, prefer to dine in non-smoking establishments. By catering to this preference, restaurants can increase their appeal to a wider audience and potentially grow their business.. Many countries have banned indoor smoking in public places for public health reasons.

 In summary, a complete ban on smoking in all restaurants nationwide is a necessary step to protect public health, create a smoke-free environment, and improve the overall dining experience. The benefits of such bans outweigh individual preferences as they contribute to a safer, cleaner and more enjoyable dining environment for all.  
 No, I don't think smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants around the country. Smoking is a social thing done by maximum of people in Bangladesh. Smoking is common in every social class from poor to rich smoking can be found done by everyone.  

 

Restaurants are a common place for smoking. In Bangladesh almost all restaurants have smoking zones because of this reason. Banning smoking in restaurants would be a great loss for restaurant owners as some people go to restaurants to smoke, eat and socialize. Many restaurants will be shut down and will be a mess for the economy of Bangladesh.  

 

There is also the problem of pollution and littering. People who smoke in the streets usually pollute the streets with cigarette ash and bud. Due to smoking in restaurants pollution has been minimized as in restaurants one can smoke in a controlled environment where no pollution occurs. Which is healthy for the environment.  

 

Public smoking is a huge problem in Bangladesh. Due to this a lot of non-smokers are punished by passive smoke. The smoke of tobacco burning is harmful and can cause huge problems to kids in the future. Lung infection to nose block it is bad. But smoking in restaurants helps eliminate that. In this situation smokers and non-smokers both are happy.  

  
We can see from the above paragraphs how important and helpful it is to smoke in restaurants and that it shouldn't be stopped in any shape or form.  
 Banning smoking at all the restaurants might create some short comings which seems neglectful but should be considered. I disagree to the fact that smoking should be banned completely in restaurants Because of three reasons. Such as: better monitoring system, less uncomfortableness for non smokers, less littering. 

At first, Smoking inside a designated facility such as restaurant smoking zone creates better monitoring. Nowadays smoking here and there has created a mass area to monitor. Which can be solved under designated areas as they are covered in CCTV facility. If this is not allowed, smoking inside sensitive areas will create much hazards.

Secondly, smoking inside a designated area will ease the pain of non smokers by making the situation less uncomfortable. No smokers face the majority of the problem of facing sudden blows of cigarette smoke coming towards their faces. Smoking inside smoking zones will lessen this problem even more. 

Lastly, smoking creates littering because of the burnt or used butts are not disposed accordingly. The smoke of smoking affects the air but the left overs of smoking affects the soil. It litters our roads, blocks our drainage system and if not affects the whole eco system. Every smoking zone in restaurants has littering boxes or ash tray and dustbin for the butts to be disposed. It Will decrease a marginal amount of littering. 

Banning a system doesn't change the affects rather creates permanent hazards which might seem negligible. Banning smoking inside restaurant will never stop people from smoking. Rather it is an opportunity to initiate better monitoring, ample ambiance for non smokers and less littering. 
 Smoking should be prohibited at all the restaurants in Bangladesh. Considering the harmful effects of smoking cigarettes not only on the person doing it but also on the people around them, there should be definite laws ensuring the need of refraining oneself from it. 
Since there's a term called secondhand smoke exposure which occurs when people breath in smoke breathed out by people who smoke and even this brief exposure has deadly effects on human body. 
Additionally, people in public especially the children between the age group of 15-19 basically teenagers get fascinated and influenced by this. Restaurant is a place where all groups of people come to enjoy their time and others smoking in an open place can be a very unpleasant experience for nonsmokers.
As I have mentioned smoking having impact on other's health it also can cause discomfort to people who have health issues like asthma. We can prevent the deaths caused by secondhand smoking by enforcing the laws. 
Lastly people visit restaurants to have a cheerful time with their families, friends or anyone it might be not to get affected by passive smoking.
In my opinion smoking ban law should be enforced in all restaurants in the country seeing all the negative effects the smoking behavior causes. 
I completely agree that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking is a very strong addiction that has taken over people of all ages. Smoking has so many harmful effects on a smoker's health. For example, it damages his lungs and increases the risk of getting cancer. A significant number of people, from all over the world die each year just because of this addiction. Smoking hinders a smoker's health improvement. However, this bad habit not only kills the person who's doing it, but also damages the health and risks the lives of people around him. As a consequence, when a smoker smokes in a restaurant, the smoke produced from cigarettes causes suffocation to others around him. In a restaurant, there might be people who are suffering from asthma. It can be really dangerous and deadly for them to stay in a room full of tobacco smoke. Moreover, old people with heart problems suffer a lot when someone smokes around them. So smoking in a restaurant can affect their heart and cause the heart to damage even more. Smoking also makes the place dirty and unhygienic. Smoking at a restaurant can have an impact on a child's health as well. Studies have shown that, smoke produced from cigars harm other people more than the one who's smoking it. So it should be banned as a smoker harms his health as well as of the others.
 Smoking, nowadays has become a norm for everyone. It has spread enormously among the youth, which has allowed them to smoke without taking notice of their surroundings.
Restaurants are public places in which people from every generation visits from toddlers to senior citizens. Smoking in a nutshell causing severe damage to the lungs of the individual who is smoking a cigarette. But, the damage is not only limited to the ones who are smoking and it spreads even further. The passerby's who are in the restaurants sitting idly and are in contact of a smoker, in their background are also hindered, just by inhaling the released puffs of smoke, causing them to be inherit the same health hazards which a smoker gains. Restaurants emit a good vibe with the help of their delicacies which releases an ample amount refreshing scent in their background, now with smokers coming into the place, the scent will dissolve, further causing more harm with the essence of nicotine. Restaurants are a wholesome place, in which families visit to spend quality time with their loved ones, thus with smokers coming into the plain, the non-smokers who cannot endure the scent of nicotine are robbed of their quality time to enjoy themselves at the restaurant by the smokers.
However, smoking brings an enormous amount of tax revenue to the government of Bangladesh. Thus, simply banning it in restaurants will strike in an enormous amount of loss, for the government. This may result in the stoppage of multi-million dollar projects, leading the country in a downward phase of development.
In the end, smoking does cause an enormous amount of damage to the ones passing by and minding their own business, simply wanting to lead a healthy life. But due the generation of tax revenue smoking should not be banned in restaurants, as an alternative the restaurants should have a smoking zone in place for the smokers, so that the non-smokers do not come in contact with them.  
 
 Smoking is undoubtedly a dangerous threat to both smokers and nonsmokers. When it comes to the threat for non-smokers, it is an important issue to discuss. Passive smoking or second hand smoking can cause more damage to the non-smokers than it does to those who smoke actively. In my point of view, smoking should be completely banned from all the restaurants in the country. 

Passive smoking mostly happens in restaurants having no restrictions on smoking. However, some restaurants in our country took the non-smokers' health into account and provided separate rooms for smoking. Though banning smoking in restaurants has been a burning question in recent times, there are people who believe that implementing a smoking ban violates freedoms and the rights of smokers. They argue that individuals should be free to make choices even if those choices have effects on their health. Additionally, some restaurant owners express worries that a smoking ban could result in decreased business as some customers may prefer restaurants where smoking is allowed

On the other hand, enforcing a ban on smoking in restaurants can motivate smokers to quit smoking or find designated areas for smoking that are separate from dining spaces. This can play a role in promoting a society and ensure a healthy life for citizens. Moreover having smoke free environments creates a welcoming atmosphere, for families and individuals who wish to enjoy their meals without being exposed to smoke

In conclusion, I think that smoking should be entirely prohibited in all restaurants across the nation. By banning smoking, we can contribute to the improvement of the nation's health and welfare.



 
 One of the most controversial topics in public health is the regulation of smoking in restaurants. As a college student, I am convinced that smoking should be prohibited in all places of dining.The health risks associated with smoking are well-documented, with several studies demonstrating second hand smoke's negative impacts on persons. First, a complete ban on smoking in restaurants would significantly improve the health and well-being of both customers and staff members. Secondhand smoke contains over 7,000 harmful chemicals, with at least 70 known to cause cancer. Constant contact with these pollutants can cause respiratory issues, heart disease, and even lung cancer. 

Moreover, banning smoking in restaurants would also contribute to a better overall dining experience. Smoke-free environments provide a more pleasant atmosphere, free from the discomfort and annoyance caused by secondhand smoke. Customers can enjoy their meals without the distraction of smoke drifting into their nostrils or the fear of inhaling harmful substances. Additionally, non-smoking diners often have to choose between entering smoking and non-smoking sections, which can be disheartening and inconvenient.

In conclusion, By implementing a total ban on smoking in restaurants, we can ensure a healthier environment for every single client, reduce the risk of respiratory diseases, and maintain a more enjoyable dining experience overall.
 
 I agree with the statement that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. 

Throughout history, mankind has been plagued with a number of vices, smoking tobacco being a fairly prominent one. Besides being a health hazard to the smoker, cigarette smoke is a threat to other people in the smoker's vicinity. Smoking in a public place, such as a restaurant is a deplorable act which endangers others. While the smoker made the conscious decision to take up smoking, the other people did not and it is unfair to subject them to passive smoking. According to a report from the World Health Organization, passive smoking is responsible for the deaths of over 600,000 people every year. This is a grave issue and should not be treated lightly.

While outright banning smoking on restaurant premises is the morally correct thing to do, from a business perspective, restaurant authorities are reluctant to do so. As it is their duty to accommodate their customers, restaurants often look the other way when patrons decide to smoke. At least creating separate smoking zones away from the main lounges should be a priority for now. A lot of newer and upscale restaurants are following this positive trend by offering dedicated smoking zones, while others have gone on to completely banning the act.

It is impractical to ban the sale of all tobacco products, as it would mean an almost trillion dollar industry would cease to exist, which would greatly affect the economy and would drastically decrease tax revenue. However, what we can do is control the environmental and health risks it poses by not tolerating smoking in public places, especially restaurants.

 
 Smoking is not only harmful for the smoker, it is also injurious for the people around the smoker. There is a term which is called passive smoking, it means breathing in tobacco smoke from other people. As restaurants are the place where people of various ages and classes visit for food and enjoyment, I think smoking should be completely banned from the restaurants. 
Smoking causes various deadly diseases like cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, chronic bronchitis etc. Restaurants are open for all kind of people and if smoking is not banned then the smokers will surely smoke and it would be harmful for both the smoker and other people who are inhaling the fume passively. Passive smoking is more injurious to children and pregnant women, it will cause respiratory illness like asthma, pneumonia etc. 
Some restaurants may have separate smoking zone but it should also be banned because it will influence others to smoke. People in restaurants pay to taste good food but breathing in the smoke fume from other person can cause asthma and cough to them. A non -smoker person has the right to enjoy his food with a good environment and breathe fresh air. So, smoking should be completely banned from all the restaurants in the country. 
 
 
 The case for banning smoking at all restaurants across the country has been a contentious issue. Smoking is a leading source of avoidable health issues, such as heart disease, respiratory diseases, various forms of cancer, etc.

Therefore, when smoking is permitted in restaurants, not only do smokers put themselves at risk but non-smokers are also put in harm's way due to indirect inhalation of smoke particles. Moreover, allowing smoking in restaurants can create an unpleasant and uncomfortable environment for non-smokers leading to limited options for customers who prefer smoke-free spaces. 

However, some restaurants have separate areas for smokers to smoke and enjoy whatever items the restaurant has to offer. Even so, restaurant employees are at a higher risk of developing health problems due to continuous exposure during their work hours in the smoking zone. 

By prohibiting smoking in restaurants, a healthier and more welcoming environment can be created, encouraging more people to dine out without the worry of being exposed to dangerous toxins and would protect the health of employees. 

As a result, I agree banning smoking in restaurants countrywide will be beneficial and create a healthier environment as well as encourage positive lifestyle choices. Even so, there might be negative economic repercussions for the restaurant industry, due to loss of business from smokers. On the contrary, they often result in increased visitations from non-smokers who appreciate the smoke-free environment.









 
Smoking has been controversial as it affects both smokers and non-smokers. There is an increasing agreement that smoking should be banned at all restaurants due to the harmful effects of secondhand smoke. Smoking in restaurants impacts customers. Secondhand smoke contains over 7,000 chemicals, hundreds of which are toxic and 70 of which can cause cancer. Secondhand smoke can cause asthma and chronic bronchitis in non-smokers. Restaurants can improve patron health by banning smoking, especially for children and pregnant women who are more vulnerable to secondhand smoke. Restaurant smoking bans can also help smokers quit. Public smoking bans deter smokers, resulting many to quit. This improves public health and reduces smoking-related healthcare costs.Smoke-free restaurants improve customer dining experiences. Non-smokers avoid restaurants because secondhand smoke is unpleasant. Restaurants attract more customers by banning smoking.Restaurant smoking bans follow the global trend toward smoke-free environments. Public smoking bans, including in restaurants, have reduced smoking rates and improved public health in many countries and cities. Following suit can make the nation a public health and environmental leader.Corporate social responsibility supports restaurant smoking bans. Smoke-free policies show restaurants' commitment to social welfare by protecting customers and staff. Health-conscious consumers and investors appreciate this.In conclusion, banning smoking in all restaurants nationwide is essential to protecting public health, improving dining experiences, and promoting corporate social responsibility. This ban will create a healthier, more inclusive society and reduce smoking's negative effects on people and the environment.
 Smoking is the poison of choice for multitudes, that despite relentless efforts, continues to enchant more of the population. A strong case can therefore be presented to ban smoking from all the restaurants in the country. However, even though on the surface this may seem like a reasonable course of action, I believe such a measure is not necessary and can do more harm than good.

With every passing day, more of society and youth gravitate towards a contrarian lifestyle. As such, to impose such a harsh ban will not be preferred by the masses. Instead, it may lead to smoking seem more desirable and encourage fickle people to take up the habit.

To ban smoking from all the restaurants in the country may seem too stern a measure, but that does not mean there is no merit to this idea. Rather, if smoking was banned from restaurants, but with the flexibility of acquiring a license and increased taxes to allow the restaurants to act as smoking lounges, it will be substantially more beneficial in the long run. There would be reduced risk of social unrest as dedicated smokers could still cherish a space that accomodates their vice, whilst people who would be rightfully uncomfortable from passive smoking could easily choose to avoid the lounges.

To invoke sustainable change in our society, even for its betterment, it cannot be conducted through extreme measures and banning smoking from all the restaurants in the country is exactly that. A more nuanced approach should be entertained. 
Smoking is fatal for health, smoking can cause terrible health concerns such as lung cancer, stroke, heart disease, asthma, bronchitis and so on. Smoking can even make a person go blind. 
However, it is a choice a person makes. On the other hand, secondhand smoke which occurs due to being in front of another smoker can be equally harmful. It can be as fatal as smoking itself. Worst part of this is we do not even know what harm it causes us just being with them while they smoke. 

I agree, smoking in public places should be totally prohibited. There can be pregnant people who are unaware of the issues that smoking can bring such as harming the baby, including low birth weight. Sometimes it is more dangerous than smoking the cigarette ourselves as it is the residue of another person's smoke. 

Smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. If someone smokes at a restaurant where a family went to enjoy it might as well make them very uncomfortable and sick, if a member has asthma, he or she can have an instant reaction to second hand smoke.

By banning smoking in restaurants, we are enabling a safer and healthier risk-free environment for people around us which will protect everyone. By creating a smoke free environment, we are ensuring safety of everyone around us.  A person that wants to smoke can go to a smoking area instead of harming others through passive smoke. Smoking in public places should be banned.
 
 

I agree with the idea of banning smoking in all restaurants. Everyone knows cigarettes are not good for health.  Smoking can cause some dangerous diseases like lung cancer, stroke, chronic bronchitis and so on. Even just the smoke of the cigarette makes a man sick.

As most of the restaurants are air conditioned, when someone smokes, the smoke spreads quite fast through the whole restaurants. A man who doesn't smoke but only breathes in the smoke of cigarettes also has a chance of getting cancer. A restaurant must be a suitable place for a family to go. A family may have children with them. We can totally understand how risky it is for a child to breath in cigarette smoke. A smoker obviously wants to relax with a cigarette and a cup of coffee in his/her favorite cafe. But they can smoke in their home or a private place without affecting others. It may cause an economic loss to some restaurant owners because some smokers may not go the restaurant after banning smoking. But the ratio of smokers and non-smokers is huge. There are many children and old people who go to restaurants. So in that term, restaurant owners can still profit from these customers. They should think about people's health more than their business. 

Obviously we can't stop someone from smoking if they don't care about their health themselves. On the other hand non-smokers have the right to breath in fresh air. Banned of smoking may cause a little loss to the owners but health should be the first concern for people.
                                  
 Smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. In the recent years, public smoking has become a very serious issue particularly in the restaurants. While some believe that people should be able to smoke publicly many others argue that it's a serious health concern. I strongly agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants across the country. Because its hazardous to the smokers and the non-smokers as well to smoke publicly on a restaurant.

Secondhand smoke is a serious concern for the people. Secondhand smoke means to passively smoke. I.e. when some one is smoking in public some other person around him might intake the smoke with or without knowing about it. Passive smoking is as harmful for the health as active smoking is.

There might be different types of people at a restaurant. Children, elderly, pregnant women people with lung issues etc. might be present at a restaurant. Public smoking might affect these people because they're very sensitive and fragile in nature. This is a serious health concern for the children, elderly and pregnant women.

Although in many restaurants there are some designated smoking zones, most of the restaurants don't practice this at all. But smoking zones are not the solution. Sometimes because of bad ventilation the smokes from a cigarette might still cause hamper to the environment and not always the smoking zones are actually smoke resistant.

So I think, at all the restaurants of the country smoking should completely be banned. As a restaurant is a place where all kinds of people visit, smoking should not be allowed there publicly. Or all restaurants should practice having designated smoking zones as well as they have to offer better ventilation system so that non-smokers don't have any kind of health hazard due to smoking. 
  Smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country  I disagree with this statement because not everyone will be comfortable with this decision also if smoking is banned in some restaurants then it will be considerable but not all restaurants.

Smoking is a addictive habit that we all know and for some people it became a lifestyle. Some people smoke daily and some occasionally. Those who smoke daily or too often can hardly live without smoking. So they smoke at their own home, they smoke outside and also they smoke in restaurants. If a restaurant ban smoking in their place then it can have a negative impact on their business because the place will be filled with non smokers and the smokers will not go to the restaurants and the business may go down some percentage. On the other hand, if the banning smoking in all restaurants can cause a mass negative impression about this measure taken by the restaurants. This negative impression can flood social media with negative comments and posts and worst case scenario it can create a mass movement by the country people.

On the other side of the page, I do agree to ban smoking in some particular restaurants which are designed and created to be much healthier and which is also children friendly. Smoking can cause bad affects on childrens health if they often inhale the smoke passed out from a smoker. Also, the old people can have some problems in their body like asthma which can be worse if the person is near smoke. It can seriously damage their lungs and also cause other problems in their body. Hence, some particular restaurants can ban the smoking or to be fair they can introduce a separate smoking zone for the smokers.

     Smoking injurious to health , is a common saying. Nowadays smoking has increased a lot. It has become very popular term among the new generation. Some of them become chain-smoker. Smoking has not any advantages. Now almost all restaurants have separate smoking zone for the smokers. 
      Smoking is a major cause of different diseases. It leads to disability and harms nearly every organ of the body. It increases the risk of heart diseases and stroke. Not only those who do smoke, but also its smog harms non-smokers. So, non-smokers also can be affected in different diseases related to smoking. Besides human health, smoking causes air pollution, which is very harmful to the environment. 
        When a restaurant provides a separate smoking zone, it encourages people basically the young generations to become addicted to smoking. Which affects people's health more badly. Moreover, those non-smokers come to the restaurant to enjoy, also affected by the smog come from the smoking zone. This facility of the restaurant also pollutes its own environment.
         Smoking facilities may increase the market value of that restaurant but it is not good for the society and also not good for the human health. Smoking has many disadvantages so smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
"I strongly support the proposition that smoking should be entirely prohibited within all restaurants across the country. The detrimental health effects of smoking are well-established, not only for the individuals who engage in this habit but also for those who are involuntarily exposed to secondhand smoke. This concern becomes even more pronounced when considering the presence of children, who can unknowingly become passive smokers in such environments.
To address this issue, implementing a blanket ban on smoking within restaurants is a crucial step. However, recognizing the practical challenges faced by passive smokers who might require designated areas for smoking, the creation of separate smoking zones or balconies is a reasonable compromise. Such dedicated spaces would ensure that individuals who choose to smoke can do so without infringing upon the health and comfort of non-smokers.
This comprehensive prohibition aligns perfectly with the overarching public health objective of curbing smoking rates and fostering a smoke-free atmosphere. It underscores a collective commitment to safeguarding public well-being over personal inclinations. By extending this ban to all eateries, the message is clear: public health takes precedence over individual habits.
In conclusion, a resolute ban on smoking within restaurants, coupled with provisions for isolated smoking zones, strikes a balance between personal choices and public health. It signifies a significant stride towards cultivating a healthier dining milieu and is pivotal in safeguarding the health and enjoyment of all patrons.
