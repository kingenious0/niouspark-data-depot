" Yes, I strongly agree with this statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
Everyone knows smoking is injurious to health but after knowing it too, people are consuming it. We can see the people smoking everywhere in the road, bus station and so on. Along with those places, mostly people are also seen smoking in restaurants. All people who smoke or don't smoke goes to restaurants for eating food. The one who smoke there disturb the other people who came there to eat food. Those people who don't smoke may have allergy or many other things from smoker which might be also dangerous for their health too.  But, nowdays all restaurants are seen selling the ciagarettes and also allows people to smokes there too in the restaurants. People going in the restaurant to food also gets irritate with those smoke exhale by the smokers. People are seen smoking as a fun in the current situation. Many youngsters are also seen smoking as a fun too. So, it is necessary to banned the smoking in all the restaurant in the country. 
  In conclusion, I would like to say that smoking is necessary to banned in all the restaurants in the country due to its various negative effects and other many more."
"No, I don't agree that smoking should be banned from the every restaurants in the county. Smoking is the habit of addiction of the people. We cant banned completely in the country because It can be dangerous for some people. Some people cant live, they cant focused on their work as well. It is the digital age and people have a lots of challenges, stress and anxiety in their daily life, so they smoke to relieve from the stress. For example, many restaurants have designated smoking zones where smokers can enjoy their cigarettes without disturbing non-smokers. This way, both groups can be comfortable, and restaurant owners do not lose customers who smoke.
 Rather than banning the smoke we can do some awareness program about the bad effect of the smoke. If we banned the smoke from all the restaurant in Nepal people will stop to go to the restaurants. If there are less number of customers most of the restaurants and hotels will shutdown because of the crisis. People go to hotels and restaurants to get some refreshment, hanging out with their friends and family. In this way hotels and restaurants can generate some income. If we banned the smoking in the restaurants people will start to smoke at their own home. People cant stop smoking by banning in the restaurants. So that we can do other things rather than banning in the restaurants.  Therefore, instead of a full ban, the government can implement rules to protect non-smokers while still allowing smokers to have their space."
"I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants in the country.  Smoking is harmful not only to the person who smokes but also to those who are around them. For this reason smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants across the country like Nepal. 
First, smoking in restaurants creates an unhealthy environment in restaurants as many people go there to enjoy food and relax, but smoking ruins the normal people experience and life too. The smoke can also get mix with food, affecting its taste and quality. Smoking also harms children, pregnant women, and people with severe health conditions. As we know that, smoking causes serious diseases, including lung, blood cancer, and heart problems. Banning smoking in restaurants would be beneficial for the non-smokers in the restaurant. Banning smoking in the restaurants can also improve the reputation of the business organization. More customers will visit smoke free restaurants knowing they can enjoy their healthier meals in a pleasant environment.
Hence, smoking in restaurants should not be allowed; it must be restricted as it causes health problems making uncomfortable to nonsmokers and can negatively affect businesses too. A complete ban on smoking in restaurants would benefit both to customers and restaurant owners.

""Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country."" yes I  agree with this statement .smoking is injourious to health. It is hamful to atmosphere. smoking causes many deases .
Government should completely banned smoking at all restaurants in the country.if smoking is banned at all restaurants it safeguards the life of  the smokers as well as that of the other people around them.studies have shown that second hand smoke kills. Second hand smoke causes sudden infant death syndrome ,respiratory infections and asthma attacks in children.
Restaurants should be suitable place for families to go to.For example : many people with their children visit XXX Restaurant on vacation .No one wants to see their children playing with cigarette butts and breathing in cigarette smoke. It will be very disturbing and annoying. However, those smokers can smoke at their home or other places themselves without affecting the others.

It is true to say that some businesses have many customers who smoke. Places such as restaurants and bars let people smoke while they are having a meal. 
Everyone knows that smoking affects people's health. Cigarette smoke can cause lung cancer and respiratory problems. Undoubtedly, we cannot ban one from smoking if they, themselves, do not care about their own health. However, as most of the restaurants  are air-conditioned, when someone smokes, the smoke will spread through the whole restaurants   via the ventilation system. Second-hand smokers will also have a great chance of getting cancer. This means that anybody who breathes in cigarette smoke is placing his or her lives at risk. Smokers are not only placing their lives at risk but also other customers.

Yes, I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants across the country. Smoking is extremely harmful to health, as it can cause serious diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and lung problems. It also contributes to breathing difficulties and mental health issues. Cigarettes contain nicotine, which is highly addictive, especially for young people.

Smoking not only harms the smoker's body but can also affect hearing and vision. It often leads young people in the wrong direction, eventually resulting in drug addiction. In restaurants, families with children often dine together. When children witness people smoking and are exposed to the strong smell of cigarettes, it can leave a negative impression on their minds. Since children tend to imitate what they see, watching adults smoke might make them curious to try it themselves, which is dangerous and damaging to their development.

Nowadays, smoking has become very common among the youth. Many young individuals not only smoke cigarettes but also consume alcohol, hookah, and other substances. This behavior gradually leads them into harmful habits and, in many cases, full drug addiction. This negatively affects their health and changes how society views them. Teenagers, too, are increasingly engaging in smoking and drinking. Instead of focusing on their studies, they fall into addiction, damaging their future and leading them down a dark path.

In conclusion, smoking does not just harm physical health—it also ruins the future of young people by pushing them toward addiction. For the well-being of individuals and society as a whole, smoking should be strictly banned, especially in public places like restaurants.

"I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking is very harmful for health, not only for the person who smokes but also for others around them. When someone smokes in a restaurant, other people also breathe in that smoke. This is called passive smoking, and it is dangerous too.

Restaurants are public places. Many families, children, and old people go there to enjoy food and spend time together. They should not be forced to breathe dirty and harmful air because someone is smoking nearby. It makes the air smell bad and can even make people feel sick.
      Smoking causes many diseases like cancer, heart disease and breathing problems. When people smoke in resturants,the smoke spreads in the air. Other people who do not smoke they also breathe in this smoke,this is called secondhand smoke and it is very dangerous . Children and older people who have never smoked,they also make victim of those bad smell.
      
      
   Many country around the world have already banned smoking in public place,including resturants.If our countries government completely banned smoking in restaurants it will show that country care about public health. It will also make our country more attractive place for tourist who prefer a clean and healthy environment .

Some people might say that smokers have rights too. But their right to smoke should not harm the health of others. If they want to smoke, they can do it in private places where others are not affected.

In conclusion, smoking should not be allowed in restaurants. It will help keep the air clean, protect people's health, and make the restaurant a better place for everyone.

"Yes, I agree that smoking should be banned in very part of the country. Daily smoking is harmful to health smoking is the easiest way to consume tobacco products like cigarettes tobacco and other tobacco products. Nicotine found in cigarettes and cigars is the factor that effects people's taste and increases water intake it exposes the human body to the family society and even the nation. It also shows problems in censer asthma, coughing swelling of the hands and breadting that is why smoking which has been practiced is our society. For example, it can still be seen in our village houses the true story of my villages is that my uncle used to run a hotel and he marijuana he know that smoking has a negative effect. On the body and he did not even sell. Even have the time to take cancer medicine and sod it from house to house. 
	Smoking should not sold if a person is smoking and is considered off then he can also get respiratory health problems like cancer. Therefore, smoking should be removed from all places in the country including hotels and public places. Since ancient times has also taken places. 
	Finally what I want to say is that smoking is having a negative impact. On every individual, family, community, even a whole nation and to remove it, the local bodies under the government will also die prematurely. "

Smoking has become a trend among the younger generation. Many youths believe that if one of their friends smokes, they must also smoke to show off their style and attitude, thinking it makes them appear bold and trendy. As a result, a growing number of young people are suffering from cancer at various stages and facing other serious health problems.

The number of restaurants is increasing day by day, even in small towns and villages. Some restaurant owners promote smoking by offering various types of cigarettes to attract more customers. Their strategy is simple yet harmful — customers come to smoke and end up buying food as well. However, this is an unhealthy and irresponsible approach. It leads to a loss of both health and wealth for the customers. Smoking has become one of the fastest-growing addictions, especially among the youth and the elderly. According to various health research studies, smoking plays a major role in causing mouth and lung cancer. Shockingly, even non-smokers are at high risk due to secondhand smoke exposure, meaning one smoker in a family can negatively impact everyone's health.

Restaurants are places where families — including small children, pregnant women, and the elderly — go to spend quality time together. A smoky environment ruins that experience and silently affects everyone's health. Since restaurants are public spaces, they must remain clean, safe, and healthy. Good food, good service, and a clean environment are the true pillars of the tourism and hospitality industry.

Smoking-related problems are already at their peak. Therefore, it is crucial to eliminate smoking in all public gathering spaces, especially restaurants. A smoke-free restaurant policy would significantly reduce smoking-related issues. So, let's say no to smoking in restaurants and take a step toward building a healthier, smoke-free society and nation."

"Yes, I completely agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants across the country. Smoking in restaurants not only affects the person smoking but also harms others around them.
When people smoke in a restaurant, non-smokers, including children and elderly people, are forced to breathe in toxic air. This can lead to serious health problems like asthma, lung disease, and even heart issues. Everyone should have the right to enjoy their meals in a clean and healthy environment without worrying about the harmful effects of cigarette smoke.
The smell of smoke can be unpleasant, especially when people are trying to enjoy their food. A smoke-free environment ensures that customers can eat comfortably without being disturbed by the strong odor of cigarettes. It also makes restaurants more welcoming for families and individuals who prefer a clean atmosphere.
Some people argue that banning smoking in restaurants is unfair to smokers. However, they can always step outside to smoke, where they won't affect others. Many countries have already implemented such bans, and they have seen positive results in public health and customer satisfaction.
Smoking should not be allowed in restaurants because it harms others and is unnecessary in public eating spaces. A ban would create a healthier and more pleasant environment for everyone.
