 Smoking should be banned in restaurants in the country. There are lots of logical reasons for this statement. Restaurants should be suitable place for families to go and they should not feel uncomfortable there. Besides, children also go to restaurants with their respectable parents. They roam and play around the restaurant. If someone smokes there and leaves the cigarette buds, then children will play with those harmful buds.
 Moreover, if someone smokes in front of children then that will be passive smoking for the children which is very harmful. Banning smoking in restaurants also helps to create awareness among the people because smoking is very injurious to health. It causes cancer and various lung related diseases. Banning smoking in restaurants will also lead to less smoking in public. There is no doubt that banning smoking will lead to some business losses.
 However, most of the customers of restaurants are non-smokers. It is also help to improve public health. Banning smoking also prevents air pollution as well. By this ban government can take advantage and do many public seminars against smoking. They can also impose rules and regulations. This will also result in smokers smoking at their homes instead of outside. So, banning smoking in restaurants is important.
 
 Yes, I agree with the statement that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. No wonder how smoking is so much harmful for the environment and also smoking can be a bad influence for other people.
Smoking plays a big role in environment and air pollution. It pollutes the fresh air and makes it feel dizzy. There is no logic behind letting anyone smoke in a renowned restaurant. It can never bring any positive outcome.  If someone is going to a restaurant, they do not expect to get sick of its air or environment.  A restaurants atmosphere and air should be refreshing and beautiful to be in. 
 In addition, smoking is always a bad influence to everyone. No matter if a person smokes or not, if someone is smoking around or publicly, it can trigger the demand for smoking for those who soke. It can influence the people who doesn't smoke as well. 
Moreover, there is a thing called second-hand smoking. If someone is smoking nearby, it's smoke can lead to a second-hand smoking to the people who are not smoking. It's harmful just like first-hand smoking.
Thus, every restaurant should ban smoking. It will be a wise and logical decision keeping it's customers health and well-being in mind.  
 I agree that smoking should be totally banned at all restaurants within the country. There are several compelling reasons to support this stance. 

To begin with and first, smoking poses noteworthy health dangers not as it were to the smokers themselves but too to the people in their proximity. Used smoke contains destructive chemicals that can lead to different respiratory illnesses and increase the chance of lung cancer, heart disease, and other serious health conditions. By executing a ban on smoking in restaurants, ready to make a more advantageous and more secure environment for both clients and workers. 

Additionally, smoking in restaurants can adversely affect the in general eating involvement. The scent of smoke can be unpleasant for non-smokers, and it can interfere with their capacity to appreciate their meals. Furthermore, smoke can wait within the discuss, influencing the vibe and cleanliness of the foundation. A smoking boycott would guarantee that all supporters can dine in a smoke-free environment, upgrading their in general fulfillment. 

Moreover, executing a smoking boycott in restaurants adjusts with the worldwide drift of advancing smoke-free open spaces. Numerous nations have as of now actualized comparable measures, recognizing the detrimental health effects of smoking and the significance of ensuring people from used smoke. By taking after suit, we are able contribute to the broader exertion of lessening tobacco-related health dangers and making a more beneficial society. 

In conclusion, a total boycott on smoking in restaurants is justified due to the health dangers related with used smoke and the negative affect it has on the dining experience. By sanctioning such a boycott, able to prioritize the well-being of clients and workers, make a more pleasant eating environment, and adjust with worldwide efforts to advance smoke-free public spaces. 
Yes, I will strongly agree smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant in the country. First of all, heath concerns. Exposure to secondhand smoke is known to be unhealthy for one's health and can raise the risk of developing a number of respiratory and cardiovascular conditions. A smoking ban in restaurants would help safeguard non-smokers from the negative effects of secondhand smoke, including patrons and staff. However, it encourages healthy environments. By making dining establishments smoke-free, people are encouraged to live healthier lifestyles and make better decisions. Additionally, since it may lower smoking rates and overall tobacco consumption, this can benefit public health. Finally, inclusion and equality An all-out ban on smoking would foster a more welcoming environment by ensuring that non-smokers, including those with respiratory conditions or sensitivities, can enjoy dining experiences without being exposed to smoke or experiencing discomfort. By making it uncomfortable for people to smoke in public places like restaurants, we can encourage smokers to reevaluate their habit and possibly take steps toward quitting completely. As a result, public health would be enhanced and the burden on healthcare services would decrease. A ban on smoking would also be consistent with the growing global trend toward smoke-free environments. Other countries and communities around the world, who recognize how important it is to protect the public's health and provide smoke-free environments, have already put similar policies in place. In conclusion, a nationwide ban on smoking in all restaurants is essential to safeguarding the public's health, enhancing the dining experience for all patrons, reducing smoking rates, and adhering to international regulations. We must prioritize public health and work to ensure that everyone has access to smoke-free environments.
 The earlier we can ban  smoking in public places, the better it would be for the human kind. Having foreseen the same, many offices and governing bodies imposed a strict ban on public smoking. This measure is generally applauded by the majority of mass. However, the opposing minority interrupt this ban as an act of arrest on one's free will. Let us discourse on this moot issue below.

It is generally agreed and even proven with scientific studies, that smoking is injurious to health. Health problems that smoking can induce are numerous. Cancer is among the major detrimental effects of smoking on one's health.  As it is rightly displayed on the cigar packets , smoking is one of the primary factors leading to cancer.

Another factor significant to this context would be the financial constraints imposed by smoking. In many developing countries, where people work on daily wages, the habit of smoking has an atrocious impact on their quality of life. In the majority of the mediocre families, around the world, smoking drains the significant part of their family budgets. For example, I witnessed many problems with reference to my father being a chronic smoker and the financial crisis it caused.

 In fact, the effect of first-hand smoke is seen permeable to even the second and third-hand smokers in the spectrum. The significance of the public ban on smoking is not just justifying but a necessity as it calls for. As a result, it is widely banned in some offices and institutions. Awareness programmes are being conducted all around the world against this habit. 
I wholeheartedly agree that smoking should be banned entirely at all restaurants nationwide. It is essential to implement such a ban due to the harmful effects of smoking and the necessity to create a safe and healthy atmosphere for everyone.

The negative effects of smoking on one's health are well known, and being around secondhand smoke seriously threatens people's well-being. We can protect the people's and employees' health by banning smoking in restaurants. Secondhand smoke contains harmful chemicals that increase the risk of respiratory illnesses, heart disease, and even cancer.

Children, pregnant women, and those with respiratory disorders are among the non-smokers who are most vulnerable to secondhand smoke. Restaurants should be places where customers can eat without breathing in dangerous smoke. A complete prohibition on smoking would protect non-smokers from the health dangers brought on by secondhand smoke, ensuring a healthier atmosphere for everyone.

All customers would enjoy their meals more if smoking were prohibited in restaurants. The odor and discomfort caused by smoking can detract from a restaurant's overall ambiance, leading to customer dissatisfaction. Restaurants can attract a wider customer base by making their spaces smoke-free, including families and anyone who appreciate a clean and healthful environment.

This, in return, can contribute to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.
In conclusion, a complete ban on smoking in all restaurants nationwide is essential to protect public health, eliminate secondhand smoke exposure, and enhance the overall dining experience for all customers. By enforcing such a prohibition we put people's health first and establish surroundings free from smoking's negative consequences. The importance of this issue must be acknowledged by officials, who must then take the necessary steps to ensure that all restaurants become smoke-free places, encouraging a healthy society and advancing the welfare of everyone in the community.
 I totally agreed with the following statement that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. It should be banned because of the health risks.
As everyone knows smoking affects people's health. Smoking can cause lung cancer and many health problems. Most of the restaurants are air-conditioned. When someone smokes, the smoke will spread through the whole restaurant. Second-hand smokers will also have a chance of getting cancer. There should have smoking zone in the restaurants. Otherwise, other customers will face trouble, as they must breathe in the cigarette smoke.
Restaurants should be suitable places for families to go to. Sometimes young children and old people also visit the restaurants. If someone smokes in a restaurant that might be harmful for those people. The ban of smoking may affect the income for a few restaurant businesses. However, the majority of the customers are non-smokers.
Nowadays, people are more aware of the importance of health. So, people thing this proposal will bring about the benefits on public health. If smoking is banned in all the restaurants, it will help to improve people's health. Health is the most important thing for people. If you are healthy enough, then you can do whatever you want to do. Restaurants should consider people's health rather than considering their income. 

I strongly agree.

Restaurants are places where one can visit, sit and enjoy a jolly time with friends and family or just sit with themselves and enjoy the food. It is a place that serves us food while we spend moments with our loved ones. Having to smell smoke coming from cigarettes or vapes while we spend good moments should not be something tolerable.

Smoking is injurious to health, yet it is not banned completely. But one lacks the decency to smoke in restaurants and cafes. One should always remember to leave the harming factors behind and enter places where children might be present. It is just a matter of good behaviour and common decency. 

Moreover, our country Bangladesh does not possess any rules or restrictions behind smokers or public smoking, unlike many countries that take steps regarding such issues and maintain it thoroughly. However, in a country where decency is still alive, one expects citizens to behave properly when visiting the same place as families and friends. Although, it is required to take steps to ban smoking, especially publicly, as smoking does contain harmful substances that don't only affect the one smoking but also the one who is inhaling the damaging components residing in the smoke. Therefore, I unarguably agree that smoking should be dismissed completely at all restaurants in the country for valid reasons.
 
Smoking poses serious health dangers to both smokers and those who are exposed to secondhand smoke.In order to protect public health, advance cleaner environments, and improve everyone's overall dining experience, this essay argues in favour of a state-wide ban on smoking in all restaurants. The overwhelming body of scientific evidence reveals second-hand smoke's harmful impact on people's health. Studies have connected breathing in passive cigarette smoke to respiratory problems, heart conditions, and even cancer. Smoking is prohibited in restaurants to protect customers and workers from health concerns and to provide a safer and healthier dining experience. Smoking in restaurants not only affects smokers' health but also negatively affects non-smokers' ability to enjoy their meals.

Restaurants may improve the overall experience and ambiance of the sector by imposing a comprehensive smoking prohibition that guarantees all customers can eat in a spotless, smoke-free environment. Additionally, a complete prohibition on smoking in establishments might be a potent motivator for people to give up smoking. People trying to quit smoking may find it easier to withstand cravings and keep their commitment to a healthier lifestyle by eliminating smoking cues and triggers from these places. By lowering the prevalence of smoking and aiding individuals in their quest for a smoke-free lifestyle, such a ban would benefit larger public health initiatives. 
Nowadays, smoking cigarettes---which is extremely harmful to your health---is fashionable. In restaurants, both adults and teenagers are smoking in public. Such labor degrades the atmosphere of the restaurants and makes it uncomfortable for non-smoking patrons. 
Smoking in restaurants is harmful to people's health because it impacts everyone's health. People who don't even smoke have to breathe in the gas that smokers exhale, which has an impact on everyone's health. Anyhow, a restaurant is a common gathering place where many children go to spend time with their parents. But because of the gas the smoker breathed after smoking, the child also has to suffer. It adversely affects the environment in every way imaginable. 
Both smokers and non-smokers find it awkward to be at restaurants where smoking is allowed. When a smoker puffs on a cigarette, he detracts from the restaurant's lovely ambiance by expelling gas that makes the place quite odorous. Additionally, because youth in our society are smoking openly in front of their elders, their respects is eroding. 
Being in restaurants where smoking is permitted causes discomfort for both smoker and non-smokers. Smokers ruin the restaurant's pleasant environment by exhaling gas that gives the space a strong odor when they puff on a cigarette. Youth in our society are also losing respect for their elders as a result of smoking openly in front of them.

In fact, research has shown that smoking restrictions can boost restaurant business.I think that the advantages of a total smoking ban in restaurants exceed the disadvantages. Restaurants are public spaces, and smoking is an unsafe and hazardous habit that has no place there.

 
 Smoking has long been acknowledged as a dangerous habit that puts both smokers and non-smokers at serious risk. A universal ban on smoking at all restaurants is necessary to protect public health and foster a smoke-free atmosphere. Such a policy would support a healthy society by safeguarding customers and staff from the damaging effects of secondhand smoking.

In conclusion, it is crucial to enact a statewide ban on smoking in restaurants in order to safeguard the public's health and improve the entire eating experience.

 Smoking is an international hassle that influences greater than simply the smoker's health. Others close by are uncovered to secondhand smoke, which can have harmful consequences on their fitness as well. Restaurants are public locations the places men and women spend substantial quantities of time and regularly come into contact with limitless people. Therefore, imposing a whole ban on smoking in restaurants would promote healthier surroundings for each client and restaurant staff.
Furthermore, smoking can damage the photograph and recognition of a restaurant. Second-hand smoke can purpose soreness and can create disagreeable surroundings for non-smoking patrons. Bad odors from smoking can break the eating experience, and clients who are troubled by means of smoke might also select to dine elsewhere. Alternatively, eating places that promote a smoke-free ecosystem have a tendency to entice greater clients who are additionally conscious of their health. 
Many nations international have already banned smoking in public spaces, together with restaurants, for the betterment of public health. Banning smoking in eating places would minimize the number of men and women uncovered to secondhand smoke, promote more healthy environments, and speak that public fitness is an excessive priority. In summary, it is fundamental to reflect on consideration on each of the fitness and commercial enterprise implications of smoking in eating places and to enforce insurance policies that make certain smoke-free environments. 
 Smoking is a dangerous habit that has severe health risks to both smokers and non-smokers. In Bangladesh, where the majority of the population is exposed to secondhand smoke in restaurants, I agree that smoking should be completely banned in the restaurants of the country. Smoking should be banned because as it has detrimental health effects, it also poses health risk for non-smokers.

Firstly, the health risks associated with smoking are clinically proven. Smoking not only harms the individual indulging in the habit but also the people around them. Studies have found secondhand smoke to various health conditions, including respiratory diseases, heart disease, and even cancer. By implementing a ban on smoking at all restaurants, we can protect citizens from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke which will foster a healthier society.

To sum up, we can say that to ensure the good health of both smokers and non-smokers, ban on smoking in all restaurants is essential in Bangladesh. By stopping smoking from such establishments, government can protect the health of the population. It is high time for Bangladesh to take wise step towards making a smoke-free future by banning smoking at all restaurants. 
 
When we came to dine in the restaurants, we actually want to have a good time while eating our food. But if we see other people smoking, I as a customer actually don't like it. Moreover, It's also had a bad impact on our health even though I don't a smoke. It's actually remind me an incident when I first go to Ghatphar with friends. I was actually quite surprised to see the ambience. Everyone was actually talking, smoking and eating. It was totally different from my imagination. I was quite obnoxious and uncomfortable at that moment. Suddenly, one of my friends pulls out a pack of cigarette and start to smoke and casually talking to us. Actually, it was nothing new, I have seen my uncles and relatives to smoke. So, after sometime I get used to the scenario. But in my opinions, restaurants should respectfully tell customer they are not allowed to smoke. If they want to smoke, they should leave this restaurants. But most of the restaurants won't do it because it will make them lose customer. So, I think that my opinions about this actually do not hold any importance. But restaurant such as Wooden Spoon have an open space where smoker can dine in and have a cigarette. But this is solution is not applicable to all restaurants!
Without any doubt smoking is very dangerous habit for anyone. There are uncountable proven bad disadvantages of the habit of smoking. It is not only effects on the smoker but also causes dangerous health issues to the surrounding of the smoker. Now, offering smoking in restaurant has became traditional thing in human life style. But they should remember that only smokers don't visit restaurants. Family persons, kids, senior citizen, pregnant women also visit restaurant to spend some quality time with their dear one while eating food. Smoking permission in a restaurant is nothing but a cheap thrills. In this modern era most restaurants are fully covered with air cooler. So whenever a smoker light up cigarettes, smoke makes the environment very suffocating. Though it is very hard to stop smoking tobacco ,we can suggest a smoking zone. Surprisingly bunch of restaurant owner think that open place restaurant can offer smokers to smoke without any hesitations which is completely wrong. Beside so many restrictions, if we take any step to stop smoking in restaurant, it may take long time but in some day people will understand its importance. Therefore I do agree that smking should be controlled or even banned in restaurants, especially those which are family firendly.
 One of the primary arguments for banning smoking in restaurants is the health risks associated with smoking. Smoking has been linked to numerous health problems, including respiratory issues and cancer. Proponents argue that banning smoking in restaurants helps protect the health and well-being of both customers and employees.
Non-smoking customers often prefer dining in smoke-free environments due to the unpleasant smell and potential health effects. A smoking ban can create a more comfortable and enjoyable experience for a larger segment of the population. This may attract more customers and improve overall satisfaction.
Employees who work in restaurants where smoking is allowed can be exposed to significant amounts of smoke. Implementing a smoking ban protects the health and well-being of employees, reducing their risk of developing smoking-related health issues.
Critics of smoking bans argue that they can have negative economic effect for restaurants. Some claim that smokers may choose to eat at establishments that allow smoking, while others argue that the bans can reduce overall customer numbers. However, studies have shown that smoking bans do not necessarily lead to significant economic losses, and some establishments may even benefit from attracting more non-smoking customers.
Opponents of smoking bans often argue that they it violates individual rights and personal freedom. They believe that individuals should have the choice to smoke in designated areas or establishments that cater to smokers, rather than imposing a complete ban.
It's worth noting that many jurisdictions have implemented smoking bans in indoor public spaces, including restaurants, to address public health concerns. These bans are often the result of extensive research on the dangers of smoking and the desire to create healthier environments for everyone.
Public opinion and government regulations regarding smoking in restaurants can vary, and it's important to consider the cultural, legal, and social context of a particular region when discussing this issue.
 
 Smoking has long been a topic of debate when it comes to public spaces, especially restaurants. I will explore the merits of completely banning smoking in all restaurants across the country. Taking into account the health and well-being of both customers and employees, I firmly believe that such a ban is necessary.

A complete smoking ban in restaurants would significantly improve the health and safety of both customers and employees. Secondhand smoke poses a serious health risk, causing various respiratory and cardiovascular issues. By eliminating smoking, we create a clean and healthy environment for everyone, reducing the risk of passive smoking-related diseases.

Banning smoking in restaurants promotes equality and inclusivity. Non-smokers often find it uncomfortable or even distressing to dine in an environment tainted by cigarette smoke. By eliminating smoking altogether, restaurants become welcoming spaces for all, accommodating the needs and preferences of both smokers and non-smokers.

Restaurant employees, including servers, chefs, and support staff, are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of secondhand smoke due to prolonged exposure. A complete smoking ban would protect their health, creating a safer workplace free from the hazards associated with tobacco smoke. This demonstrates a commitment to employee welfare and fosters a healthier and more productive workforce.

A comprehensive smoking ban in restaurants aligns with efforts to promote public health and reduce smoking-related illnesses. By creating smoke-free environments, we encourage smokers to reconsider their habits and potentially reduce or quit smoking altogether. This ban would contribute to a cultural shift towards healthier lifestyles and significantly improve the overall well-being of the population. 
 Smoking is widely acknowledged as a severe public health issue. Day by day, the number of smokers is increasing. However, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. 
Passive smoking is a big concern in a restaurant. Since most restaurants are not open-air based, smoking inside those restaurants leads to passive smoking.  Passive smoking is very harmful to our bodies, unlike active smoking. Several studies showed that being affected by passive smoking raises the chance of severe diseases like lung cancer, coronary artery disease, and breathing problems. Restaurants should be viewed as enjoyable places where consumers can eat without harming their health. Restaurants that allow smoking exposes non-smokers to the dangers of passive smoking and make the atmosphere unpleasant for people who don't smoke. According to economists, restaurants that do not allow smoking do not face any business loss. Smoke-free environments draw more customers, including non-smokers who may have walked back from dining in places where smoking is permitted.
A complete ban on smoking in all restaurants is necessary to ensure public health. The restaurant owners should know the customers' satisfaction and take the required step to build an enjoyable and safe environment. Moreover, the Government should make a strict law to ban smoking in every restaurant. 
 
Smoking has become a very harmful habit nowadays. People know how bad smoking is for their health but still they do it. Nowadays we see people smoking even in restaurants. Not all restaurants allow smoking but some restaurants do. Especially in some big restaurants in our country, smoking is prohibited. And in my opinion, people should have this freedom. But of course, no one's problem like they can have a separate smoking room in the restaurant so that smokers can go there to smoke. Meanwhile, there must be a separate seating area for the common people who are there who don't like to smoke exclusively. According to me, smoking is a personal choice of people so if someone wants to smoke in a restaurant then he can go to a separate room to smoke. He should have this freedom. If someone wants to smoke in a restaurant and the restaurant has the capability to afford a separate room, then it will be okay for everyone. Finally, I can say that instead of banning smoking in restaurants, there should be a separate room for smokers where they can sit and smoke and of course, they should make sure that it is not a problem for common people. 
 
The topic of banning smoking in all restaurants across the country has two sides to it. Some people argue that a complete ban is crucial for public health. Others believe that individual rights should be considered and other alternative solutions should be implemented.

A complete smoking ban in restaurants is important to protect the public health and the well-being of customers and employees. Secondhand smoke can cause irritation and health problems to people who are simply bystanders. By implementing a comprehensive ban, restaurants can create a safer and friendlier environment for all.

On the other hand, the argument can be made that this violates personal freedom and opinion. Restaurant owners themselves should have the freedom to decide whether to allow smoking in their premises, and the customers can choose whether or not to visit the smoking zones in restaurants based on their preferences. Maybe it can be a better idea to have designated smoking and non-smoking zones within restaurants. That way, it provides the best of both worlds for all parties. There can also be other methods to solve this problem. Implementing stricter ventilation systems or designated outdoor smoking areas can help reduce the impact of secondhand smoke while still allowing freedom of choice.

In conclusion, the topic of a complete smoking ban in all restaurants generates strong arguments from both sides. While protecting public health can be important, it is important to keep individual rights in mind and come up with less drastic solutions. Implementing measures such as designated smoking zones or improved ventilation systems can provide a compromises that reduces the problem while respecting individuals who make the choice to smoke. 
First of all, smoking is harmful to health. Smokers also suffer from other diseases such as tuberculosis and heart disease. Symptoms may take a while to appear, but eventually lead to a serious crisis. It affects not only the smoker, but also those around him. Both active and passive smokers can get sick, so a total ban on smoking in public places needs strong support. Second, smoking is an addiction that also affects non-smokers. Anything addictive is not safe and tends to spread quickly. The influence of peers and peer groups is common in the formation of smoking habits. It's easy to start smoking when you're a long-term smoker. People spend a lot of time in public places, so smoking in public places should be banned to avoid this negative effect. Finally, among smokers, non-smokers feel stressed. Pregnant women, the elderly and children have difficulty adjusting to an environment filled with cigarette smoke. It can irritate non-smokers of all ages. Smoking in public places should be banned as it causes a serious nuisance. In my opinion, there should be some smoking areas in the common areas. Bus stops, shopping centers, restaurants and offices must have separate smoking areas so addicted smokers are not influenced or disadvantaged.
Smoking cigarettes which is very injurious to health has become a fashion nowadays. Adults as well as the teenagers are smoking openly in restaurants. Such work hampers the environment of the restaurant, make the place awkward for the other customers who doesn't smoke.
Smoking in the restaurants are injurious to people's health as it affects everyone's health, those who doesn't even smoke has to inhale the gas which the person exhaled after smoking the cigarettes and such affects the both smokers and non-smokers health. Anyway, restaurant is a public place and in there many kids also come to spend some quality time with their parents. But the kid also has to suffer because of the gas the smoker exhaled after smoking. It hampers the environment in every possible way.
Smoking in the restaurants make the place awkward for both the smoker and the non-smoker customer. When a smoker smokes a cigarette, he hampers the beautiful environment of the restaurant by exhaling the gas which makes the environment of restaurant very smelly. Also, the adequate of the teenagers of our society are vanishing as they are smoking openly in front of their seniors. 
Smoking in the restaurants are becoming a major problem in our country as it makes the environment of the restaurant very awkward and with that it affects the health of the non-smokers very badly. Smoking is injurious for everyone so our government should take some major steps to quit smoking and they should completely ban smoking in the restaurants as well as the other public places.
 
 While acknowledging the health risks associated with smoking, I disagree with a nationwide complete smoking ban in restaurants, advocating for individual choice and finding a middle ground that accommodates both smokers and non-smokers.

Banning smoking in all restaurants restricts individual freedom, and instead, designated smoking areas or well-ventilated spaces should be considered to respect the rights of both smokers and non-smokers. A complete smoking ban can have severe economic consequences for small businesses, so a balanced approach with designated areas can address concerns while mitigating financial strain. Promoting responsible smoking behavior and adhering to designated areas fosters a considerate environment, promoting social responsibility and acknowledging smokers' rights. Implementing measures like improved ventilation or outdoor smoking areas can minimize the impact of secondhand smoke. A balanced approach that respects the rights of both smokers and non-smokers allows for informed choices and accommodates diverse preferences. Society should strive for a harmonious coexistence by striking a balance between smokers' needs and non-smokers' rights, rather than implementing a complete ban that may alienate a portion of the population and disregard compromise.

A complete smoking ban in all restaurants infringes on individual freedom and can have unintended economic consequences. A balanced approach with designated smoking areas and promoting responsible behavior is a fair compromise. Respecting individual choice while minimizing the impact on non-smokers creates an environment of accommodation and mutual respect. 
  Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country  I agree with this argument. There are various reasons for which I stand by this claim. Health issues, fine dining experience, clean and pleasant environment. 
Smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke have been proven to have harmful effects on health. Restaurants are public spaces where people of all ages, including children visit to dine and socialize. A smoking ban ensures that non-smokers, especially vulnerable groups, are protected from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke. It promotes a healthier society by reducing overall tobacco consumption and the associated health risks. Non-smokers can enjoy their meals without being exposed to the discomfort and annoyance of secondhand smoke. The implementation of a smoking ban in restaurants enables positive role modeling. By establishing smoke-free areas, it is made very obvious that smoking is not a desired or socially acceptable habit. This can discourage young people from starting to smoke and encourage healthier lifestyle choices. It helps to reinforce not smoking in public norm in society that creates a positive impact. A complete prohibition on smoking in establishments could be another incentive for people who want to give up smoking. By limiting smoking chances in public areas, it supports the decision to stop smoking and promotes an environment that is supportive of those trying to live healthier lives.
 
I agree, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. For a number of convincing reasons, smoking should be fully prohibited in all restaurants across the nation. First off, secondhand smoke seriously endangers the health of both patrons and staff. It has been demonstrated by numerous studies that secondhand smoke exposure raises the risk of respiratory illnesses, cardiac issues, and even lung cancer. We can safeguard the health and welfare of everyone who enters restaurants by enforcing a smoking prohibition there. Specially, when babies are going restaurant to eat something, they feel insecure on bad fumes. When trying to enjoy their dinner, non-smokers frequently find it stressful and uncomfortable to be around the scent and presence of cigarette smoke. We can guarantee that everyone may thoroughly enjoy their food without the intrusion of hazardous odors by outlawing smoking in restaurants. Smoking restrictions reduce tobacco use and increase the rate of quitting, according to research. We can urge smokers to reassess their habit and possibly take measures toward quitting completely by making it less comfortable for people to smoke in public places like restaurants. In turn, this would improve public health and lighten the load on healthcare services. Additionally, a ban on smoking in restaurants would be consistent with the expanding global trend toward smoke-free spaces. Similar policies have already been put in place by other nations and towns around the globe, which understand how crucial it is to safeguard the public's health and provide smoke-free environments. In conclusion, a total ban on smoking in all eateries across the nation is a crucial move to protect public health, improve the eating experience for all customers, lower smoking rates, and comply with international standards. It is essential that we put people's health first and seek to make smoke-free settings available to everyone. 
I agree that smoking should be banned from all restaurants across the country. The reason I came to this conclusion has to do with the effect of secondhand smoke. Someone who smokes is decreasing their life span also as the smoked exhale is toxic he or she is also affecting others around them or without realizing it. Research shows the terrifying truth that second-hand smoke or inhaling the smoke that is being exhaled by someone who is smoking can lead to cancer. A restaurant is a place where we go just to eat or spend quality time with our family. There can be children, elderly people, or a nonsmoker in the restaurant by smoking in that restaurant we are putting those people at risk of cancer and other disease. To stop this we could ban smoking from restaurants so that we can spend quality time with our loved ones. In bangladesh more then 50% of the polulation is addicted to smoking ciggrate so it is diffucult to ban smoking from the resturent. If it is difficult to do so then restaurant owners should at least create a separate space (smoking zone) for the customers who want to smoke so that their poor choice or lack of situational awareness would not affect people around them. 
Smoking is very injurious to health. It can cause serious damage to the body. It can cause many lung, heart, and respiratory diseases. It can even lead to death. A cigarette is mostly tobacco that contains nicotine and many harmful substances. Smoking is usually an act of inhaling or breathing in the burned or smoked substance that is in the cigarette and then exhaling it. As it is inhaled and exhaled, the burned smoke goes into the consumer's body and also spreads into the surroundings where he/ she is smoking. So, those who are around can also unintentionally inhale that smoke. Since the smoke contains many harmful substances and harms the body, whoever inhales it gets affected by it. So, those who do not smoke also get affected and may develop some illnesses or diseases caused by the cigarette even if they do not smoke. Some people also have asthma and due to the smoke, they might face asthma attacks.  So, it is not right to smoke in public places. For example; restaurants, cafes, etc. Many people go to restaurants and there are children, the elderly, the young, and many different types of people with different health problems. If someone smokes in public places like this, it can affect the health of the non-smokers too. They can develop any lung or heart or respiratory diseases. The children or elderly might have an asthma attack. The smoker is risking everyone's health by smoking in a restaurant. So, smoking should be banned completely at all restaurants in the country.
As a student, I wholeheartedly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. It's essential for the well-being of both customers and employees.

First and foremost, when I go to a restaurant, I want to enjoy my meal in a clean and healthy environment. Secondhand smoke is a major concern, and it's unfair for non-smokers to be subjected to the harmful effects of someone else's smoking habit. It can lead to respiratory problems and increase the risk of serious diseases. By implementing a ban, we can ensure that everyone can savor their food without worrying about inhaling toxic smoke.

Moreover, times are changing, and smoking is becoming less socially acceptable. People are becoming more conscious of the health risks associated with smoking, and many cities and countries have already taken the step to create smoke-free spaces. It's about time that restaurants follow suit and align with these changing attitudes. A smoking ban would demonstrate a commitment to the well-being of their customers and show that they prioritize health and safety.

From a practical standpoint, a smoking ban in restaurants could actually be good for business. Think about it: families, health-conscious individuals, and people with respiratory conditions would feel more comfortable dining in a smoke-free environment. By catering to a broader customer base, restaurants could attract more patrons and potentially increase their revenue. It's a win-win situation.

In conclusion, banning smoking at all restaurants is crucial for the health and well-being of everyone involved. As a student who enjoys going out to eat, I believe that implementing a smoking ban is a necessary step forward.
 Smoking is the most prevalent issue we encounter today. There is much discussion concerning the negative effects of smoking, including whether smoking should be entirely prohibited in all restaurants across the nation. This essay argues for a widespread smoking ban in restaurants.  

For instance, smoking in public settings, especially restaurants has drawbacks including the risk of hurting others, the disruption of other patrons and the issue of non-smoking establishments. Firstly, food can become unappealing to non-smokers because of smoke. Additionally, many people will steer clear of eateries that permit smoking for this reason, which may disadvantage restaurant proprietors. Secondly, dining establishments should be welcoming to families. For instance, many families with young children frequent restaurants. There are kids there who enjoy it. However, cigarette smoke is extremely dangerous to young children if anyone is smoking there. Thirdly, customers and employees both face a health risk because of smoking . It is unfair to subject customers and restaurant staff to these risks given that smoking has been linked to major health issues like cancer among non-smokers. So, restaurants ought to be smoke-free. We might therefore draw the conclusion that smoking ought to be entirely prohibited in all restaurants across the nation. 

 
 

  
 Banning smoking completely in all restaurants have both sides.
The good part is about health. It isn't unknown to anyone that smoking is injurious to health. Smoking is harmful not only for the smoker himself but also the people around him, the harm exponentially increases when it is done in a closed environment. So, if one person is stopped from smoking in a restaurant, which is mostly situated in a closed environment it will save many people from getting potential health hazards. 
Now let's talk about the negative sides. Firstly, as it will reduce the number of the cigars consumed, it will reduce the government's high earning from its tax, it will also reduce the cigar manufacturer's profit due to less quantities sold, the company even might cuttle its workers too. So it has a negative impact on the economy primarily. Then, smoking is nothing illegal, it is basically one's personal choice. So if one is stopped from smoking in a restaurant, it is basically harming his personal space, personal freedom. 
So, is there a way to minimize the negative sides while maximizing poaitives? Yes, there is. The simplest solution is to create dedicated smoking zones in restaurants which will be beneficial for all the parties involved.  
I agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country. Smoking being harmful is not the reason, but it is concerning because non-smokers, kids, and sick people might be harmed by it. Smoking zones do not help a lot. We can easily detect that there is heavy smoking going on around us. When people get out of the zone, anyone can smell it and become uncomfortable. In restaurants, people come to try out new dishes, items, and offers and have a relaxing time with their friends, partners, and loved ones. I do not see any reason why there should even be smoking in a restaurant in the first place. Trying out new food is a heavenly feeling for a food lover. And in a city, people often visit restaurants just for a get-together with their friends. Smoking should not get in the way of a beautiful moment. Smokers need restaurants to smoke; there are thousands of places for it. Most importantly, restaurants are for all kinds of people. There might be people who have trouble breathing, are dealing with mild sickness, are allergic to smoke smells, etc. Smokers should not have the right to make their smoking habit a priority and ruin their time.
 Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country-yes, I am completely agreeing with this statement.
Smoking is very dangerous for the human body. But day by day it's just increasing. People are forgetting their morals. now most people start smoking anywhere at any time. they don't care about the environment or the people around them. if one person is smoking the people around that person is also affected in many ways. Nowadays some restaurants have a corner for people to smoke like a smoking zone or smoking corner. but where there is no such corner for smokers' problems happen the most.in restaurants, we usually go for enjoying our food or to take our meal. but nowadays people publicly smoke in a restaurant. whether it is an open space or in a room they don't care about the surroundings. there are special kids and old people who suffer the most in this case. the air gets polluted so much. Even the smell of nicotine can also mix with your food so in that case you will not be able to eat your food properly. Those who are non-smokers feel so much suffocation.
So, especially in restaurants, there should be strict rules for smokers. then all types of people will enjoy their meal in a good healthy way. So, Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country as soon as possible. 
 I agree that smoking ought to be entirely prohibited in every restaurant in the nation. This kind of restriction would be advantageous for a number of reasons.
The primary health risk associated with smoking is to individuals who are exposed to secondhand smoke as well as the smokers themselves. Numerous dangerous compounds found in secondhand smoking, including those that may lead to cancer, heart disease, and major respiratory and cardiovascular difficulties, are present. We can safeguard the health and wellbeing of patrons and workers by enforcing a smoking prohibition in restaurants, making the area safer for everyone.
Furthermore, a smoking ban would make it more enjoyable for non-smokers to eat out. Many individuals find the smell of smoking to be unpleasant, and it may significantly reduce how much they enjoy a meal. We can guarantee that non-smokers may enjoy their meals free from the intrusion of secondhand smoke by outlawing smoking in restaurants, boosting their entire eating experience.
A smoking ban also fits well with the worldwide movement to encourage healthy lives and decrease tobacco usage. Strict smoking prohibitions, including those in restaurants, have previously been enacted in a number of nations with favorable results. These restrictions have reduced the number of smoking-related ailments, the rate of smoking, and overall population health. By imitating them, we may advance public health and bring our nation into compliance with global norms.
In conclusion, a total ban on smoking in all eateries throughout the nation is a sensible and essential move to safeguard the public's health, improve the eating experience for non-smokers, follow international trends, and profit restaurant owners. We can secure everyone's happiness and well-being while also making society a better and more pleasurable place to live by establishing smoke-free surroundings. 
I concur that smoking ought to be entirely forbidden at every eatery across the nation. There are several compelling arguments for why smoking must be completely banned in all restaurants throughout the country. To begin with, smoke that is inhaled by people who are not smoking, also known as secondhand smoke, puts both customers and workers in great danger of harm to their wellbeing. Several research studies have shown that being exposed to cigarette smoke that is released into the air from someone else increases the likelihood of developing respiratory problems, heart-related health conditions, and possibly even cancer in the lungs. We can protect the well-being and safety of all individuals who visit food establishments by implementing a ban on smoking within them. Particularly, when infants go to a restaurant to consume food, they feel uncertain about unpleasant odors. While attempting to have an enjoyable meal, individuals who do not smoke often feel anxious and uneasy being in the vicinity of the odor and existence of tobacco smoke. According to studies, limits on smoking decrease the prevalence of tobacco consumption and promote an increase in cessation rates. We can encourage individuals who smoke to reconsider their behavior and potentially work towards quitting entirely by making it more inconvenient for them to smoke in communal settings such as restaurants. Furthermore, prohibiting smoking in eateries would match the growing worldwide movement towards areas that are free from tobacco smoke. Overall, enforcing a complete prohibition on smoking in all dining establishments throughout the country is an essential step to safeguard the well-being of the public, enhance the dining experience for every patron, reduce smoking prevalence, and adhere to global benchmarks. It is crucial that we prioritize the wellbeing of individuals and aim to create a setting without smoke.
 There has long been discussion and controversy about the problem of smoking in restaurants. I wholeheartedly agree that smoking should be entirely prohibited in all restaurants across the nation as a specialist in public health and wellbeing. For the sake of the customers' and staff' health and safety, I shall present convincing arguments in this essay as to why such a restriction is essential.

The health consequences of secondhand smoke are a primary reason to ban smoking in restaurants. Secondhand smoke contains dangerous compounds linked to cancer, heart disease, and respiratory ailments. By banning smoking, we prioritize the health of non-smokers.

Restaurants cater to all ages, including children, the elderly, and those with medical conditions. Vulnerable populations are at higher risk from secondhand smoke. A comprehensive smoking ban ensures a safer environment for all patrons.

Restaurant employees are exposed to secondhand smoke daily, leading to long-term health issues. A smoking prohibition protects their health and allows them to work in a smoke-free environment.

A complete ban on smoking in restaurants acts as a powerful deterrent for smokers to cut back or quit. Smoke-free laws have been shown to encourage smoking cessation and reduce tobacco use.

Strict smoking prohibitions have been enacted in several countries. Joining this international trend helps protect public health and minimize smoking's negative impacts.

In conclusion, a complete ban on smoking in restaurants is essential for the health and safety of customers and staff. Secondhand smoke poses serious risks, and a ban promotes a healthier dining environment. Such measures support smoking cessation efforts and align with global initiatives.

 
 Smoking is harmful and puts both smokers and non-smokers' health at risk by causing a number of health issues such lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory issues. This essay advocates a view that a nationwide ban on smoking in restaurants is necessary to prioritize the health of both customers and staff.
A no-smoking zone creates a better atmosphere for everyone. Significant health concerns from secondhand smoke should not be experienced by people when they are eating. By enacting complete prohibition, we protect non-smokers' rights to breathe clean air and shield them from any potential health risks brought on by passive smoking.
A smoke-free environment enhances the appeal and experience of dining businesses overall. Customers may have a bad perception of the atmosphere as a result of smoke and its lingering smell. By outlawing smoking, eateries can establish a friendly setting that appeals to a larger spectrum of customers, such as families and people who value clean air and a smoke-free environment.
The argument put out by opponents is that a smoking ban restricts individual freedom and decision-making. It's crucial to keep in mind, though, that exercising personal freedoms shouldn't come at the expense of the safety and health of others. The right of nonsmokers to live in a secure and healthy environment should not take precedence over their right to smoke. Additionally, people can still smoke in specific areas outside of restaurants, upholding their right to personal preference while safeguarding the health of others.
Ban on smoking in restaurants protects health and enhances dining experience, creating a more enjoyable, inclusive, and healthier environment.
 
 Yes, I agree, Smoking is a bad habit that has an impact on the smoker as well as others around them. Smoking has been linked to a number of detrimental health impacts, including a higher chance of lung cancer, heart disease, stroke, and respiratory disorders. Despite this, a lot of people still smoke, frequently in public settings like restaurants.

I believe that smoking should be entirely prohibited in all dining establishments across the nation. Both smokers and non-smokers would benefit from a safer atmosphere as a result of this. Smokers would be urged to give up or find other locations to smoke, while non-smokers would no longer have to worry about the health consequences of secondhand smoke.

This restriction has previously been enacted in a number of nations, including Ireland, Norway, and New Zealand. Positive changes in the air quality and smoking rates have been observed in these nations.

Additionally, prohibiting smoking in public places like restaurants can help lessen the social acceptance of smoking. We can help prevent young people from adopting this deadly habit by reducing the visibility of smoking in public areas. Young people are particularly susceptible to peer pressure and societal norms. Smokers who assert that they have the freedom to smoke wherever they like may, of course, object. This argument, however, ignores the reality that smoking creates adverse externalities that harm those nearby. Smoking is prohibited in restaurants only to safeguard patrons' health and safety. 

In conclusion, I think that all restaurants across the nation should be entirely smoke-free. This will not only make everyone's environment safer, but it will also urge smokers to give up and lessen the social acceptance of smoking. 
 The topic of banning smoking in restaurants is a contentious one, and opinions vary depending on cultural, social, and health factors. Here are some arguments commonly made for and against such a ban:
Arguments for banning smoking in all restaurants:
Public health: Secondhand smoke can be harmful to non-smokers, and a ban would protect restaurant employees and patrons from exposure to harmful substances.
Encouraging quitting: A ban could motivate smokers to quit or reduce their smoking habits, leading to potential health benefits for them.
Clean air and ambiance: Smoke-free environments improve air quality and create a more pleasant dining experience for non-smokers.
Economic benefits: Healthier patrons and employees might result in reduced healthcare costs and increased productivity.
Arguments against banning smoking in all restaurants:
Personal freedom: Some argue that individuals should have the right to smoke in designated areas, even if it's within restaurants.
Business impact: Restaurant owners who rely on customers who smoke might experience a decline in revenue.
Smoking areas: Some suggest designated smoking areas as a compromise, allowing smokers to smoke without exposing others to secondhand smoke.
Individual responsibility: Critics claim that individuals should be responsible for their own health choices, and non-smokers can choose to eat at smoke-free establishments.
It's essential to consider both the health implications of smoking and the potential impact on businesses and personal liberties when discussing such a ban. Public policies are often the result of a balance between public health interests and individual freedoms. The stance on this issue may vary from country to country and even within different regions of a country, depending on local customs, norms, and legislative processes 
 Yes, I agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants. Because everyone has the right to work in a comfortable, clean, and healthy environment. This is hindered due to smoking as it causes discomfort to others and dirties the place with cigarette ashes.   

We have a general idea of how harmful smoking is to one's health. However, inhalation of cigarette smoke present in the air by non-smokers, known as passive smoking or second-hand smoking is as harmful as smoking a cigarette directly. It's important to keep in mind that smoking doesn't only harm the smoker, but also the people around them. The smoke can cause discomfort for those nearby, and for children in particular, it may lead to serious illnesses like cancer later on.   

Smoking in a restaurant not only poses a health hazard to others but also increases the risk of a fire outbreak within the establishment. Additionally, this creates a negative impression for other customers regarding the restaurant's atmosphere. It's important to note that the odor of cigarettes can have a negative impact on the overall dining experience by affecting the aroma of food and potentially causing a loss of appetite.  

Every individual who visits a restaurant must be able to enjoy their meal in a smoke-free environment. To ensure that this is achieved, it is imperative that smoking be banned in all restaurants. This will enable all customers to enjoy their dining experience without being exposed to any harmful secondhand smoke.  
 Nowadays smoking is more likely a fashionable thing for young people. I agree with the fact that smoking at restaurants and other public places should be completely illegal. In this essay, I will discuss and give you some valid points about why this should be banned.

To begin with, Smoking is injurious to health. It can create dangerous health issues. Smoking affects not only the smoker but also the nearby people. Passive smoking is a proven health hazard, passive smokers can suffer from respiratory problems, heart disease, and even cancer. By enforcing a ban, we create a healthier dining environment, ensuring that non-smokers are not exposed to harmful smoke against their will.

Second, passive smoking has very hazardous health effects on children and young people. Smoking should not be introduced to children while they are still developing. Additionally, a smoke-free society will be promoted and a good example will be established for the younger generation by prohibiting smoking in restaurants. Additionally, with safer working conditions, restaurant employees who are frequently exposed to secondhand smoke will have fewer health hazards. Thirdly, smoking in restaurants contributes to environmental damage in addition to health problems. One of the most frequently found littered items is cigarette filters, which release hazardous compounds into the air, water, and soil, harming ecosystems and wildlife.

In conclusion, we can say that a ban on smoking at all restaurants in the country would be a brilliant decision. By doing this we can safeguard public health and promote environmental sustainability. 
  Smoking is injurious to health  this is what we see on packets of cigarettes, which is true. People who smoke should not do it in public places such as parks, beaches, local buses, trains etc. In short, they should not smoke around people who do not smoke, because smokers are risking others' lives including their own. But in restaurants the scenario is different. I do not support the idea of banning smoking in restaurants. 

Now a days restaurant is the place where we see most of the people spending their quality time with their friends and family. Now it is impossible that no one from that friend circle or family do not smoke, because here in Bangladesh 35% of its population is smoking cigarettes on daily basis. This is where restaurants did an amazing job, which is they came up with smoking zones. Smoking zone is a particular room or a corner of the restaurant which is covered with thick Thai glasses or bricks. It is usually a place where smokers can smoke without causing harm to any other people who do not smoke. 

There are so many people who do not smoke, but they breathe into that poisonous smoke which comes from their friends or uncles' cigarettes. This life taking smoke makes people sick and sometimes they cause diseases like asthma. But because of these restaurants and their smoking zones, smokers are now smoking away from others and not causing any social crime by smoking in public places. Though some people are still smoking in local places but the rate of that has decreased because of restaurants. Restaurants are helping to balance the number of local smokers.   
 Smoking is harmful for peoples health. Smoking causes many diseases such as cancer, stroke, heart attack, diabetes, lung diseases and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In restaurants people pay to taste good food. Smoking should not be allowed in restaurants because it can do harm to others. Health is the most important thing for people. It is true that some customers are smokers but it is harmful for others. On the other hand, non-smokers feel very stressed when among smokers. For pregnant women,senior citizens and children is difficult to adjust to an environment that is filled with cigarette smoke. It irritates non-smokers of various age groups. Smoking in restaurant should be banned as it leads to annoyance to a large extent. Nevertheless, some people oppose this. 

The conclusion should be that smoking should banned because it is unhealthy for both the smoker and those around them. As a whole, the case for smoking being banned is clear. Smoking is a proven health hazard that causes numerous diseases and deaths, both in the smoker and bystanders. It should not be permitted in public places or workplaces.
 
 Smoking has been considered a health hazard in most advanced countries, not only for the smoker but also for others who have to inhale second-hand smoke. Smoking is a major cause of lung cancer and creates complications in treating some other major illnesses, like, diabetes and heart problems. 
In most of our restaurants, the ventilation system is not great, if at all present. I agree that some modern and expensive restaurants have good air conditioning which may alleviate some of the smoke accumulation problems. But a great majority of the restaurants are catering to common people and such have practically no ventilation system at all. Smoking in those restaurants will accumulate second-hand smoke and adversely affect non-smokers. That's why, without making any distinctions, most developed countries have banned smoking in public places and also outside within 10 meters of the place.
Some may argue that the restaurants would not get clients as many people still smoke. However, studies in some countries, as well as practical outcomes, indicate that people gradually adopt the new behaviour within restaurants. For example, in Canada, when smoking was banned in pubs and casinos, the owners predicted that their businesses would fail as smokers would stay away. This outcome did not happen. Of course, one could say that two other vices, drinking and gambling were much too attractive to stay away from! However, in the same manner, our people, poor or rich just cannot stay away from the restaurants. Not being able to smoke there would also help those who really want to kick the habit.
Therefore, considering the pros and cons, I firmly believe that banning smoking from all restaurants will ultimately be beneficial for non-smokers as well as those smokers who want to quit but haven't the firm resolve to do so. 
 Smoking is one of the most widespread causes of death in the modern world. When smoking is permitted in public settings, particularly restaurants, everyone is at risk of being exposed to secondhand tobacco smoking. From my point of view, smoking should be entirely banned at all the restaurants throughout the country.

To begin with, the scent of smoking might suppress one's appetite and turn them off their food. People visit restaurants to eat good food, not to be thrown off by polluted selling smoke. It also makes restaurants unsuitable for family outings. For instance, lots of families with young kids visit restaurants. Nobody wants to see little kids inhaling smoke or playing with cigarette butts. Furthermore, smoking should not be permitted in eateries due to the dangers of secondhand or passive smoking. Asthma attacks and possibly cancer can result from passive smoking, caused by inhaling tobacco that comes from smokers.

Bangladesh legislation prohibits smoking in restaurants with four walls and allows restaurant owners to build smoking zones in open areas. It's undeniable that many restaurants have a significant number of regular consumers who smoke. While many restaurants may suffer without such consumers, businesses can still turn a profit by targeting to non- smokers.

In conclusion, smoking in restaurants must be banned so that all diners get to enjoy a smoke-free meal, which is the only healthy thing to do. 
 Smoking is definitely something negative and should not have existed at the first place, there is no doubt in that. But since it does, it is affiliated not only with our health, but also with a lot of important things like our entire economy. Here is why I disagree with the statement mentioned the title. 
'Smoking is injurious to health' is a statement we often see almost everywhere from movie intros to the walls of the bus. Ironic enough but the package itself has the statement printed on it. But people still smoke. As we know that it is a choice but sadly often it is not. People often get dangerously addicted to the point they cannot quit anymore. 
Now let's talk about smoking being a choice. As much as a fantastic idea it would be to ban smoking from all the restaurants in the country, it will still be a huge injustice to a large amount of people. No matter how self-sabotaging and harmful the decision is, it is still a country of free will. Just because some of us think it will be a good idea, we cannot just force our ideologies on someone else. Not to mention, how a great deal of customers a restaurant is going to lose if they ban smoking from their place because they won't have a variety of adjustments for all kinds of their customers. 
Although banning smoking from all restaurants in the country might sound like a good idea to a lot of us, it will be a matter of great disrespect towards people's respective choices and a huge business risk for restaurants at the same time. Instead, restaurants should make arrangements for both types of people by having two different areas for smokers and non-smokers. This way everybody wins. 
 
I strongly agree with this statement. We all can agree with the statement that smoking is very bad for one's health. Still some people smoke and they do it in their own will. We can spread awareness but can't force someone to stop smoking. People become addicted to smoking and this addiction is hard to just let go. Our loved ones like, parents, siblings, relatives, children, friends become addicted to smoking which is very sad to see. We want best for our loved ones so we want them to stop this unhealthy practice. Which is why it is important for us to take steps which will distract smokers from smoking and use that time to do or think about other things. And one place where we can take this step is at restaurants. Now-a-days restaurants are commonly one of the most visited places for family gathering, hang out with friends, dates, office discussions as well as to spend some me time. That's why smoking in a restaurant is not only unhealthy for smokers but also for all the people present in that restaurant. if all restaurant bans smoking inside the restaurant then those who smokes will be distracted for that time being. And this step can help casual as well as chain smokers to reduce the amount of cigarettes they smoke in a day. Which might make casual smokers to stop smoking. This step will eventually not only be beneficial for the smokers but it will also be beneficial for non-smokers as well.
Smoking is injurious to health and it is known to everyone. Smoking in a public place should not be done. But i think smoking should not be banned in every restaurant in the country.  If it happens, people will smoke outside in public places, smokers will suffer to find a place to smoke and a negative  impact will be on the environment.

Many restaurants have smoking zone. People who smoke regularly can go there to smoke, otherwise they have to smoke outside, which is not good for the public. 

It is not possible to quit smoking easily. So for them, it is necessary to have an open place at restaurants so that other customers can  enjoy their respective time. If they do not find any proper place to smoke, they may smoke at home, which is unhealthy for their family members. 

Again, it is not good for the environment if anyone smokes outside or in any public place. It is pathetic for non-smokers, children, pregnant women and senior citizens.

So I think it is necessary to have a smoking zone at restaurants. If it is totally banned, all will suffer simultaneously. The environment also has to suffer because of this. We should work on how to make people aware of the dangers of smoking instead of banning the smoking zone at restaurants. 
 Smoking is injurious to health. It is considered a bad habit because of it's numerous negative health impacts. For example, it can increase the risk of cancer, lung disease, heart disease, respiratory issues and stroke etc. It can also affect a person's overall appearance, premature aging is also one of the impacts .Moreover there are no positive impacts of smoking known by men so far. Passive smoking is also harmful for people around the smokers. That's why smoking in public places such as restaurants should not be allowed as it can prove to be harmful for non-smokers. Needless to say smoking in restaurants should be banned.

There are various reasons why people smoke, such as youngster and teenage people think it is cool to smoke, a lot of people are influenced by their peers to smoke, a majority of people consider smoking as a stress reliever and the list goes on. Regardless of the reason, it is harmful as we have already discussed the damaging effects. 

Second hand smoking means inhalation of nicotine substances by someone who is not directly consuming the substance but through someone around them. It is also known as passive smoking. Ban on smoking in restaurants is definitely a good idea as it includes passive smoking. Restaurants can assure protection for both the customers and employees by this. All over it can ensure a pleasant environment for both the parties. 

However there is a debate that a ban on smoking is a violation of personal freedom but it is generally for the betterment of public. Furthermore there are many more places for the smokers to choose from. 

To sum up, we can say complete ban on smoking in restaurants is a great decision for everyone as it is for the betterment of the general public. 
 
 In modern times, the issue of smoking has become highly controversial. There are some people who say that smoking must be banned in restaurants, however others believe that it's a wrong idea. I strongly agree with the former view and my opinion will be discussed in further paragraphs with a suitable conclusion.
Generally speaking, there are a number of reasons why I believe that smoking should be canceled not only in restaurants but also in all kinds of public places because it harms our health. The people who smoke cigarettes harm themselves as well as the people in their society. Smoking can cause various diseases in our body which are very harmful for us. To cite an example< it causes diabetes, Lung cancer, asthma, stroke etc. Furthermore, the smoke form cigarette smells terrible. That's why the government should forbid smoking in restaurants and all public places.
Despite these arguments, many people feel that smoking should not be banned in restaurants for a number of reasons. The main reason is that there are many smokers in our country and restaurant owners should make a place for them so that they can smoke, Overall, I don't think it's a good idea because we should not encourage people to smoke. If we allow people to smoke, the number of smokers will continue to increase, and we will get nothing but lose a lot.
In conclusion, it must be said that smoking is extremely harmful for us. That said I feel that smoking. should be banned in restaurants including various public places. 
To ensure a healthy dining experience for all citizens, the complete prohibition of smoking in restaurants across the country emerges as an urgent and crucial necessity.  Smoking is regarded as a contentious and pervasive habit that offers significant health concerns to both smokers and non-smokers. As the harmful health effects of secondhand have become more apparent, the call for smoke-free environments has grown stronger.

To begin with, it is essential for eateries to be suitable place for families to go to. For instance, McDonald's attracts many families with young children. It is pivotal to make sure that such places remain smoke-free, as nobody would want to witness children exposed to such hazards. It is undeniable that many customers want to smoke while having their meals but if the new rules are imposed everywhere, they are bound to follow them.  

Furthermore, the ban of smoking will safeguard the health of both personnel and customers. Smoking in restaurants has been believed to negatively impact the flavor of foods and has also led to diminish employee productivity as they are constantly exposed to secondhand smoke. Besides, implementing a smoking ban could contribute in reducing the prevalence of active smokers. Banning smoking in public areas can act as a deterrent for potential smokers and motivating existing smokers to kick the habit. Consequently, there is a probable reduction in smoking rates, leading to a heathier population and a decline in smoking related diseases. 

To sum up, implementing a countrywide ban on smoking in all restaurants is an essential step towards promoting public health and well-being. Moreover, a nicotine free dining environment will enhance the overall pleasure for all customers, which will make restaurants more appealing and inclusive spaces for everyone. 
 Smoking is one of the most worst habit of human being. It is also popularly known as cigarette to mass people. It is made of tobacco plant. Smokers smoke kind of all the time. That is at work,free time and even they are tensed about something. Smoking causes different types of diseases like cancer, bronchitis and other lung diseases. We cannot totally ban cigarette as much revenue of our country comes from this. 

I feel that smoking should be banned at resturants because it is a place where people eats. Restaurant is a family place where people of all kind comes with their family members and enjoys a good time there. Now a days we can see smoking zones at restaurant which is good as people who doesn't smoke can ignore that part. But the main problem arises when we see people under eighteen goes to the smoking zone.

We should keep restaurant clean and not use it like a pub. Yes many elderly people does smoke and they can use smoking zones for that but we should be careful about the young generation misusing it. Strict rules should be set for smoking at restaurant as it is a public place otherwise it is fine.

Besides government should take initiative about the uses of tobacco around the country. A fine example is our neighboring country Bhutan which is the first smoking free country. We should always remember smoking will cause bad effect on our health in the long run.
 
 We all know that smoking is injurious to health. Smoking causes cancer. Though many people smoke to get relief from their stress. During intense pressure or stressful work, some people are quite used to smoking as it works as a pressure reliever for them. Some people smoke in their offices, public places, home, restaurant, tea stalls, etc.
But restaurants are suitable places to hang out with friends, families, etc. No one wants to see young children playing with cigarettes. If people want to relax by smoking instead of taking coffee or food it will be disturbing and annoying for other people. However, those smokers can smoke at their homes or in suitable places so that people will not feel any disturbance. 
However most of the restaurants are air-conditioned, when someone smokes, the smoke will spread through the whole restaurant which is harmful to non-smoker people. They also have a great chance of getting cancer. 
So from all perspectives, I don't think that smoking should be allowed in the restaurant. However, I think the majority of customers are non-smokers so if smoking is banned from the restaurant it will not affect the profit of the restaurant. It will also help to improve the health of the people. Health is the most important thing.
So, for all these reasons I agree with the statement.  
 
I agree with the above statement. Even though, smoking is a personal habit it comes with a lot of backlashes. The fumes from cigarettes are harmful for the people inhaling it passively just as much as someone inhaling it directly from smoking. Nicotine is a harmful substance which is a part of cigarette and it causes cancer. It severely damages one's lungs and can cause fatal diseases like lung cancer. When someone is smoking cigarettes in a social setting, the smoke is prone to be inhaled by everyone around them in a close proximity. Especially in places like restaurants a lot of people are likely to get affected by the fumes of smokers smoking in the restaurant. Some people might already suffer from major diseases and inhaling smoke may either create other physical complexities or can increase the fatality of the diseases that they may already have. Keeping that in mind, one should not smoke in a public social setting like restaurants because it may hamper other people's well-being. With that being said, everyone deserves to have their own rights and if one wants they can smoke but it needs to be made sure that one's personal habits shouldn't affect someone else or the society. 
Smoking should be completely banned at the restaurants in the country and I completely agree with that. We all know that smoking is injurious to health. If a person smokes it not only affects his/her health but also affects the people surround him. In Dhaka there is a vast amounts of restaurant and there is a smoking zone, many people go to the restaurant for smoking. Many child and young see that and it become curiosity to their minds. They started to do smoking because of their curiosity. Smoking not only affects his/her health but also disturbs the whole environment. There is nothing advantages about it. Smoking should be completely banned in the restaurants it will maintain health cautions in restaurant. A smoker brings a bad odor in the restaurant which discomforts the consumers.  Some people are allergic to smoke and when they come to restaurant with their family for refreshment and when the smokers smoking in the restaurant it will bring bad impacts to their family and children. Not only that smoking also harms the pregnant women and their unborn child. Some people only comes to the restaurant for smoking and they dont order anything. It impacts the economy of the restaurant. So we should create awarness about smoking in restaurant as it ony creates bad images and discomforts the non smoking consumers. Smoking at any public place has impact on others and hampers their without even their knowing. So im strictly against the smoking in restaurants.
Smoking is a harmful habit for both active and passive smokers. Restaurant is a public place where people gather around all the time. When a smoker smokes in a restaurant he doesn't only do harm to his own health but also to the health of people around him in the restaurant. So, smoking should be banned at every single restaurant in the country.

Smoking is undeniably a bad habit. It causes a lot of health problems such as lung cancers, heart disease and malfunction of respiratory system like asthma. Even the nonsmokers who inhales the smoke passively gets affected at the same level of a smoker even more in some cases. Some studies say that passive smoking is more harmful than active smoking. So, if smoking in restaurants be banned, all the people in that restaurant can be protected from all these health issues.

If we prohibit smoking in restaurants, we can assure a pleasant environment to all the customers. Some people feel suffocated by the smell of burning cigarettes. For them having meal where people are smoking is undoubtedly a terrible experience. So by prohibiting smoking in the restaurant we can provide a better aroma in the restaurant and increase the pleasantness of eating the meal. As a result restaurant owners will get more customers and earn more revenue from the business.

In conclusion, smoking should be totally banned I n every single restaurant in the country in order to secure public health, provide a greater dining experience and save the nature from air pollution. This will protect people from the dangers of active and passive smoking and promote healthier lifestyles.

For the above reasons I totally agree that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country
 
 Smoking has detrimental impacts on both active and passive smokers. It is proven that smoking leads to health issues for both chain smokers and people close by.  Due to its harmful effects, some believe that smoking should be banned from restaurants. I agree with their statement.
Medical studies show smoking causes bronchitis, asthma, coronary artery diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and cardiovascular problems. Tobacco leaves contain nicotine. Daily consumption of nicotine can lead to cancer. 
Smoking not only harms the people who choose to do it but also affects the people surrounding them. Passive smokers suffer from suffocation, asthma, lung damage etc. Families often visit restaurants and food courts with their children. Pregnant women, senior citizens and toddlers are often present in restaurants. Often, they suffer from serious health issues because of the toxic fumes.
Often students are seen smoking cigarettes in restaurants surrounding schools, colleges and universities. Non-smokers are usually uncomfortable in these situations. Students often fall victim to peer pressure and start smoking. Many students and employees smoke as a coping mechanism just to fit in their social circles.
Smoking can be a huge fire hazard in diners and restaurants. Most of the restaurants use gas stoves to prepare food. Gas needs just a spark to catch on fire and burn the whole place down. Uncontrolled flames like cigarettes can be very dangerous in these situations.
In conclusion, banning smoking in public places like restaurants can be controversial. Individuals who choose to smoke even after knowing the risk factors should be responsible only for their own health. Considering the damage smoking does it should be banned from restaurants.

 
 It can be an argumentative issue to discuss on if smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country or not.
If we look at it from a moral point of view, it is utterly wrong to smoke in a public restaurant where people come to spend their time with their beloved ones. And the smoke can be extremely disturbing for those people and let's not forget how harmful it can be for health.
On the other hand, from the marketing mindset, if we can manage an extra 'smoking zone' for the smokers, not just regular people but also the other people will go to that restaurant. Thus it will increase their customer engagement for both party with respect. And no one will be disturbed by the other party. 
It is a matter of fact that smoking will never be banned because of the market value it created in economy for years. Preventing something which is nearly impossible to do so is a waste of time and effort. Rather with strategic mindset we can take necessary and strict rules to make people understand and respect the other party with absolute decency.
Since smoking helps growing the economy and kills our lungs at the same time, we can try to help both party through a few arrangements. That's what I believe about banning smoking. 
 
I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking is responsible for more than 1,300 deaths every day. So, it is clearly not a good habit. Allowing designated smoking areas in restaurants can unintentionally make smokers feel important, which encourages the habit. It also lets cigarette companies advertise their products unethically.
Restaurants are places where people of all ages go, including children. Seeing someone smoke might influence them in a bad way. Non-smokers have the right to breathe clean air, but smoking zones make them uncomfortable.
If restaurants stop having smoking zones, it could help smokers quit. If it's absolutely necessary to have smoking areas, they should be outdoors, away from the main dining section.
More importantly, such a ban would create a sense of community well-being as it reflects a collective effort to prioritize public health over individual preferences. It shows that as a society we value the health and comfort of all individuals, and we are willing to take necessary steps to protect everyone from the harmful effects of smoking.
Therefore, banning smoking in all restaurants is vital for public health and making sure everyone can enjoy their meals in a smoke-free environment. It encourages smokers to quit and protects non-smokers from harmful secondhand smoke. 
 
Yes, I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country.
Smoking prohibition in restaurants will improve public health. Many families with young children go to these restaurants. However, it will have negative impacts on children. Smoking will be very disturbing and inconvenient for the non-smokers at the restaurants. Restaurants owners have many smoking customers. Hence, they do not forbid smoking there. Smokers would undoubtedly spend less money at restaurants. If they learned that smoking is prohibited there, which would hurt both the restaurant industry and the overall economy. But smoking ban in restaurants is an essential move for the sake of the public health. 
Everyone is aware of the adverse effects smoking has on one's health. Lung cancer and respiratory issues are brought on by smoking. Smokers won't stop smoking, but there needs to be a private area where they can do so. Additionally, there are a lot of customers who are concerned about their health. Therefore, smoking near them will be harmful for them. Smokers endanger not only themselves but also other customers in restaurants. Without a doubt, restrictions could impact some businesses income levels. But the majority of the customers at the restaurants are non-smokers. 
We could conclude by saying that it is essential to ban smoking in all restaurants in our country.
 
 Smoking is something which is mostly viewed negatively but for some it's their coping method. It's something people do out of curiosity or being influenced by friends/ society. But it is something which is equally harmful for the one who's smoking and whoever is around them. That's why it should be totally banned from all the restaurants in the country in my opinion.

Smoking has infinite harmful effects on the actual smoker and the people surrounding them. It causes so many serious health conditions such as stroke, lung cancer, heart diseases etc. 

Restaurant is somewhere people often visit with their loved ones. So when someone is smoking in a restaurant it means they're putting their loved ones in danger of serious health risks. The smoke which comes out of a cigarette is heavy and spreads slowly. The slower it spreads the longer it's around people. 

A ban of smoking in restaurants can encourage a group of smokers to quit smoking as it is so harmful for not only them but the people around them. It will create a better environment for future generations and people will less likely to get serious health conditions. 

That's why I agree strongly with the fact that smoking should be completely banned in all the restaurants in the country. 
 Smoking is really good for stress relief believed by most of the population in the country. It increased during COVID as it works like a stress reliever. However, . Some people still believe it is a horrible addiction and hampers health in the worst way possible.

Nowadays, most people choose their restaurants based on the smoking zone it has. Mostly pretty restaurants have nice smoking zones. Which deprives non-smokers to visit these places frequently because they get bothered from the smoke. Sometimes, non-smokers have to sit at the smoking zone for their friends to give company. If smoking is fully banned all restaurant It might reduce sales as most people come for spending their time at the smoking zone. Ban smoking at all restaurant could lead to shutdowns of restaurants as chain smokers would not even visit. Furthermore, to take this step the government will be the first one to reject as they receive the highest tax revenue from cigarette industries. Reduce taxes may slow down the growth of a developing country.

On the other hand, people will not have asthma, cancer or any other diseases for smoking. For instance, a smoker can control themselves from smoking in restaurant for 2-3hours which will barely hamper a restaurant's business. Hence, banned at all restaurants will lead to better environment to live in and have lesser diseases. It will bring a hope for the new generation that people are better without any addiction. 
 Yes, I do agree with the statement that smoking should be permanently banned at all the restaurant in the country. There are some logical explanations to support my statement.

Public Health Concerns : Smoking is a well-known health hazard. Smoking causes serious threat to everyone's health. Non-smokers who are exposed to secondhand smoke, run the risk of developing significant health conditions like heart diseases and respiratory disorders. It is just as harmful as actually smoking. In our country, Restaurants are indoor spaces with poor ventilation systems. So smoke can quickly spread throughout the space and cause health problems for both customers and employees. Banning smoking in restaurants would help protect everyone's health. Hence restaurants should prohibit smoking. 

Cleaner Environment : Smoking not only causes health problems but also creates an unpleasant environment for everyone. Cigarette smoke can linger on clothing and other surfaces, leaving an unpleasant smell and causing the restaurant to be less clean. So smoking restrictions will make the air cleaner and the surroundings more welcoming for everyone. When dining out, non-smokers frequently find it uncomfortable and unpleasant to be around smoke. 
Promoting Healthier Habits : A smoking ban in restaurants may persuade smokers to cut back on their overall tobacco use or give up completely. Because fewer people smoking will result in lower healthcare expenses and a healthier population, this could improve public health outcomes.

Overall, we can see the benefit of banning smoking at the restaurant. There are several strong reasons why smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country.  So we should be more conscious and aware regarding this matter to lead a happy and healthy life.



 
 No,I do not agree with the fact that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.Smoking should be obviously banned in the dining area, but outside that, a designated spot for smoking shouldn't be a problem to others staying in the dining space.

Smoking is a very controversial topic.The hesitation,discomfort and hatred towards smoking are connected drastically with the social norms than its actual dangers to both the human body and the environment.Smoking is more like a personal preference. It is undoubtedly injurious to health and many advertisements, seminars and campaigns are hosted for making people aware of its harmful effects. Even the packet of cigarettes holds images of severe health problems caused by smoking.But still, some people choose to do it on their own accord,which might or might not seem normal to the general people. So it's an imposition to tell them not to smoke.

However, people who smoke should be sensible enough to not make the people around them uncomfortable by their smoking, they should politely find a place where they don't disturb anyone.If smoking is banned at all the restaurants totally, it might result into a much bigger problem than smoking itself.For example,even after being banned, some people might still continue smoking in the washroom or the staircase.This creates a far more uncomfortable situation for the guests and ruins the reputation of the place.
Thus it is better to create a small designated space for people who smoke,outside or a bit distant from the dining hall, for creating a favorable environment for everyone visiting the restaurant. 
Yes, I agree with the statement. Smoking is already known as a bad habit. Smoking causes many incurable diseases such as cancer, bronchitis, asthma etc. People see smokers from negative perspectives. And when someone is openly smoking in a café or a restaurant, it causes inconvenience for the surrounding other customers. The other people who are consuming the smoke coming from cigarette feel uncomfortable. Sometimes, people in restaurants feel so uncomfortable to the point that they leave the place. Thus, some restaurant authorities prohibit smoking inside the restaurant. Smoking inside cafes or restaurants is inconvenient to the consumers. Though some restaurants have separate smoking zone these days. People who smoke use the smoking zone in those restaurants. This causes less inconvenience for the other consumers. But when all the tables of non-smoking zone are booked, some stubborn customers use the smoking-zone. And so, they have to consume the smoke. But when customers smoke in a restaurant without separate smoking zone, the other customers become bothered, feel uncomfortable. Children or any customer having asthma can have difficulty breathing due to the smoke. Again, some customer being annoyed can make complains against the smoker. Sometimes, teenage customers can be interested in smoking if they see someone doing so. For these reasons, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country.
Smoking is frowned upon everywhere in the world, it harms the person consuming cigarettes as well as the people around them and their environment. Smoking is not good for anyone except restaurant owners who can use it to their advantage. Nowadays, any place that allows people a place to sit down for a coffee and cigarettes becomes the new hotspot. Banning smoking in restaurants does not really reduce the number of people that smoke, as people that smoke will continue to smoke, just at a different place or at their own homes, therefore banning smoking at restaurants is kind of redundant. From a business stand point, having a smoking zone at your restaurant is a huge cash grab, as you will not be losing customers, instead you will be attracting more. You may lose some customers who actively are against smoking or have their kids with them, but in the bigger picture having a smoking zone is more profitable than not having one. Therefore, smoking at restaurants should not be banned if the incentive is to get people to stop smoking, in Bangladesh cigarettes are very easily accessible and even when taxed heavily it is quite cheap, it will be nearly impossible to stop people from consuming it, no matter how many labels you put on it with scary pictures and warnings.
 I completely agree with the fact that smoking should be banned from all the restaurants of the country. It is because restaurant is a public place and smoking in restaurants hampers the overall environment.
 When a person smokes in a restaurant openly, the people around him are also get affected by the smoke which is being produced by him through smoking. As a result, these people might get affected by diseases like cancer, respiratory infection, hearth attack etc. for which they are not even responsible. Study shows that the people with secondhand smoking are getting more affected than the actual smokers. So, to save these innocent people we must prevent smoking at any cost.
 When smoking is banned in a restaurant, the smokers will feel hesitation to smoke. They will feel that smoking is not normal everywhere. Their sense of responsibility or even self-respect may arise. So, in this way their habit of smoking will reduce eventually.
 Some people may feel that smoking is their right and banning smoking is restricting their right. In this case, the restaurants may create a separate space for smoking, from where no smoke comes to the main area of the restaurant. 
 In conclusion, I will say that smoking should be banned in all the public places, not only in restaurants. The innocents should not suffer for the deed of the smokers.
  



 
Smoking is hazardous to human health. It exists in our society for a long time now. In spite of severe awareness campaigns, smokers are still unable to quit this bad habit. Smoking not only affects the consumer but also people nearby suffer more and if it is a public place, non smokers find it difficult to stay. So, I agree with the statement , Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country .
Moreover, restaurants will be more healthy and safer for people who are health conscious and it will help attracting more health conscious people which as a result, will increase the revenue gained through restaurants. Serious health complications of smoking like heart disease, lung damage can be reduced through this ban implementation. As a result, families will suffer less from treatment costs of health issues. 
Furthermore, this implication may force smokers to quit the habit in a gradual manner. They will be refrained from smoking in public places .This may drastically improve the ambience of the restaurant where children, pregnant women and restaurant waiters and other people can breathe clean air. Restaurants can garner immense praises due to this praiseworthy action of ban on smoking. Everyone can have a wonderful dining experience with their families.
With all that this will bring a positive change in the society as well as health conditions will improve among people. Restaurant industry will thrive and attract new customers who were not pleased with restaurant environments before.
.   There is a proverb  Smoking causes cancer''-putting that in our consideration we can agree to the above statement. If the restaurant provides a soothing environment for all the customers then smoking can be accepted there. Following the statistics of ''British American Tobacco(BAT) which is one of the largest multinational corporations, we come to know that-''Bangladesh contributes approximately more than two-thirds of the revenue derived from the cigarette industry,having contributed over BDT 29.5 crore as taxes to the National Exchequer in the year 2022.'' In this case an eminent part of our economy relies on the tobacco sales. An adult knows about the pros and cons of smoking. It depends on the person whether he/she will do it or not. To maintain a healthy life one must stop smoking as smoking can cause diseases like- cancer, stroke, diabetes,chronic bronchitis etc. Smoking in public places is hazardous not only for the smoker but also for the people around him/her. It also causes air pollution and endangers our environment. Now-a-days some restaurants in our country have smoking zone and it is separated from the food corner. According to me, it provides an acceptable environment for both the smokers and the non-smokers. My opinion about it will be- smoking can be allowed in the restaurants if the restaurant has a specific smoking zone. Otherwise the smoke can cause a hazardous situation for the non-smokers too. Our economy earns a good amount of revenue on the exportation of tobacco. It will not be a good idea to eliminate this from our industry. But when we are talking about a good environment in our restaurants,it is necessary for the restaurant to provide the customers with what they feel comfortable with.                              
 Smoking has been an outrageous concern for decades and its harmful impacts on both smokers and non-smokers are well-known. Nowadays, public health concerns are rising and so the government is planning on taking certain steps to evacuate smoking from several public spots. Restaurants are one of the most scattered places for smoking nowadays and certain aspects say that smoking should be banned at all restaurants.
First of all, banning smoking would protect the well-being of not only smokers but also non-smokers since the polluted smoke won't be inhaled by humans anymore. Furthermore, some people visit restaurants for good ambiance, i.e. they may not want to take their children to such restaurants where people would smoke and so this becomes a down effect on the restaurant sales as well.
Secondly, smoking bans also come up with a lot of economic benefits. This would help lower healthcare costs, as fewer people would suffer from smoking-related diseases. A smoke-free environment would attract more customers which might help in generating more revenue. 
However, smoking bans might refrain a particular segment of young people from coming into restaurants because some of the individuals might not be bothered about health concerns rather they may just want to come with a circle of friends when seeking a place of smoking facilities. Also, some individuals might claim to have the right of making their own decisions, even if it impacts others negatively.
In conclusion, I believe that smoking bans could help influence people to leave this habit when they'll be in a situation where smoking is prohibited. As a result, taking this step would create a choice towards a healthier and safer society. 
   I firmly believe that smooking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.Here are some important things.

 
Health risks: Smoking is a well-known cause of health problems for both smokers and non-smokers.We can safeguard the health of customers as well as staff members who might otherwise be exposed to these dangerous toxins by outlawing smoking in restaurants.

Public health benefits: Studies have shown that smoking bans result in a reduction in smoking rates, which is beneficial for public health.By establishing smoke-free areas, we can motivate smokers to give up, ultimately lowering the burden of smoking-related illnesses on the healthcare system.

A better eating experience:The smell of smoke, which lingers on clothes and hair and can be unpleasant, effecting the enjoyment of a meal. We can ensure that everyone may thoroughly enjoy their eating experience without any discomfort by outlawing smoking.

Commitment to global trends: Recognizing the significance of safeguarding public health, several nations and areas throughout the world have already implemented comprehensive smoking bans in restaurants. We can align our policies with global norms and help to create a society that is healthier and more advanced by adhering to these global trends.

In conclusion, an outright ban on smoking in restaurants would improve the quality of life for everyone, lessen the burden of smoking-related illnesses, and make dining in more enjoyable and delightful for all.   
Yes, I stand with this statement that smoking should be banned in restaurants. restaurants are places we go with families and friends. The smoke makes it really uncomfortable because not everyone is used to with this smell. People are getting more health conscious and I think as a health hazard allowing smoking is not upright. Many people might have issues. When it comes to family the parents never want their child watch smoking people around.it encourage people to smoke more.so we should create some limitations. Business persons says that it will bring loses if they don't allow smoke. But I believe restaurants can still make profits because the main purpose of coming restaurants is food and comfort. Everyone knows that smoking affects people's health. . Lung cancer and respiratory issues can both be brought on by smoking cigarettes. Undoubtedly, we cannot forbid someone from smoking if they do not value their own health. However, because the majority of restaurants are air-conditioned, when someone smokes, the smoke will spread over the entire establishment via the ventilation system. Additionally, secondhand smokers have a high risk of developing cancer. Without a doubt, the prohibition may have an impact on a few enterprises' revenue levels. However, nonsmokers make up the majority of restaurant patrons. The public's health will be enhanced if smoking is outlawed in all restaurants. The most crucial factor for people is their health. You can do everything you want to if you're in good enough health. Even though the current economic downturn requires us to take economic stability into account, if our citizens are healthy and willing to work hard enough, the economy will return eventually.
