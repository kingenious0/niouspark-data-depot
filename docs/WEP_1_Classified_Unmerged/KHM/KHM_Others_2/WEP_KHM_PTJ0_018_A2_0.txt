 We live in the same society, we want to have a better education to get an opportunity for apply for something. As a university students everyone need to be ready to taking risk for doing things. College students not just learn with doing nth and received money from their parents. I strongly agree with the statement above.
 Firstly, we need to challenge ourselves as an adults to gain more experiences for applying something new. For instance, if you have finished your university and you want to find a job which is related to your degree with a good salary, but you never experience working. Therefore, I thought with no experience you will start from zero because most company usually need an employee with some experiences. 
 Secondly, we have a chance to talk about the amount of salary that we need per month if we have a lot of experiences. For example, I know that work hard and study hard at the same time is difficult, but you will deceive better. Moreover, you will get a great opportunity in the future because you know how to handle especially to fight a fear. 
 Last but not least, some people might think that learn with no work will be more focus than work and study at the same time, but they must be mistaken in this ages students should learn the different ways to see how they are born for and to know what is life. Therefore, it is important to have a job as a collage students.
