 I agree with the college students to have a part-time job. Because it is really important to all college students and
when they the college students have a part-time job they can get alot of news experience , when they working that
they can not learn in  thier class. They can get money to spend or pay with thier study at the university thier own 
food , clothes , but some college students they can help thier family too. They give some moeny to thier family.
The part-time job is the best thing that can make all the college students to find and get money buy themself , they 
can help themself. And when they work a part-time job can make the college students more about positive education
all the experience they got from thier part-time job can make them to think about thier furture carees. 
However , having a part-time job is a big responsibility for a college students job really important in thier life. 
Full time and Part-time job are important good for college students. It can make them to find a good job and get 
money to pay with thier family or thier study. 
In conclusion i think that the part-time is good and the best way for college students. It can help them to get alot of 
experience , get alot of money to pay with thier university. Can help them to know alot of knowlauges , make them 
improve thier education in thier classes. They can find and get a good job in thier future by thier experience that 
thier got it. Sometime the part-time job is only 1-5 hours in a day, So they can spend alot of times with thier study 
at the university , research or do thier assignment.
