 Nowadays, we can see that smoking has increased every day and everywhere. Smoking can make our body weak and also provided a bad health. I truly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
 Firstly, smoking can impact other people for no reason. Take myself as an example, I always ate breakfast near my workplace before going to work. There is a man come and smoke while I were eating, you know it is really annoy and make me feel not comfortable.
 Secondly, about health. We try to protect our body to make it become healthy and strong like go to the gym, eat healthy food and so on. We never drink beer or smoke because we know that it is not a reason that our body needed. For instance, if there is someone smoking at the restaurant or around the restaurant area you will be think that it must be impact to your health. 
 In short, smoking is not a good idea to do, not only in the restaurant but any public place that have many people because you never knew how other feel. As it can annoy people feeling and also impact to the mental health, therefore, smoking should be banned.
