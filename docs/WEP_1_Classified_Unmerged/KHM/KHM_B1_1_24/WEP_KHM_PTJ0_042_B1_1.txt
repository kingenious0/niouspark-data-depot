 Do you think school is the only place for you to learn? No, learning is not only from school. School is just a place that you can prove with a piece of paper relevant to your academic performance after you graduate from many theories . To me, anyone can be your teacher, anywhere could be learned, especially from the community you live in. I would agree that it is important for college students to have a part time job based on three remarkable reasons such: students could apply theories they learnt without any delay, students could bring some practicum from outside to reflect in school, and financial support.

Working place is a place where you can apply your theories from school and to measure much you comprehend. By working, students are able to gain some experience as their stepping stone to a big job. However, if we take a look at some students who don't have any chance to practise, they may forget what they have learnt so far and have zero experience. So, I strongly agree that students should have a part time job during their college.

In another reason, absorbing experiences from outside also helps students to do well in school. As we know that school provides lectures and all of those need real reflection and experience to accompany each other. That's why I can say that students should look outside the box to complete something in the box. So, it's a matter of work. 

Last but not least, working totally could help some students with financial support as they have a difficult background. As for myself, my family couldn't support me well for my studies as I have to spend on many items. So, I have to work even if I don't want to. However, at the same time, I can apply, learn and earn money.
