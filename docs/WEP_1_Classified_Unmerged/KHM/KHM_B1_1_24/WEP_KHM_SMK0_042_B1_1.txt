The Health World Organization says that Tobacco (item in the cigarette) kills more than 8 million direct users and 1.2  non-smokers are affected by second-hand smoke each year.
This is enough to prove that smoking cigarettes is not good for users and should be banned in public places. Based on this, I strongly agree that  smoking cigarettes should be completely banned at all restaurants in terms of health effects from the cigarette . 

Cigarettes and their smoke cause many health issues such as cancers, heart disease, stroke, and lung, and weaken your immune system. When you smoke, you blow the smoke all over the restaurant and splash it on your family, servants, kids, old people or maybe pregnant women through the atmosphere and air they breathe in. More danger, if the place installs air conditioners which can get all your smoke in then produce it out to everyone. Additionally, even if some people don't see the long-term impact of smoking to their health, they sure feel uncomfortable, and not healthy to enjoy their meal. Another impact to the restaurant owners, if they allow those people to smoke in, they could lose other customers as well, and there is absolutely no 5 stars rating. 

Last, smoking cigarettes should be banned everywhere in public not only in restaurants, as when you smoke, but its smoke will also blow along the air, yet as human beings, we need fresh air to breathe which leads us to good health conditions not risking with cancer, heart disease, or any kind of it that cause from cigarettes.
