 I agree that the part time is very good for the university students as I have experienced to japan.  I saw that the university at japan they always find the part time job to do during study. 
Partime job it can help the university students to help their family to reduce school fee and meal fee. Moreover, Part time job it can provide us an experience to reach our goal either and we can study a lot from work place about the work flow and working environment. 
Part time job for university students it can make our country runs smoothly .
The people who have the part time job during study it can make them with the strong person and strong life due the life is struggle and they will know the money is not easy to find.
How ever, University students they have tried to do their best to find the part time job. They should not discriminate the working, Even though that job is waitress or Gardner .
For example. As me after I have graduated my first job is worker and after that I work as waitress. So we have try our best to do what we can do and the dream will be come true 
To conclude above topic I would to request our government or Schools Monitor to make the exhibition of job inside the school or public place.  It is the easy way or chance for the university students to find the job. Thanks.
