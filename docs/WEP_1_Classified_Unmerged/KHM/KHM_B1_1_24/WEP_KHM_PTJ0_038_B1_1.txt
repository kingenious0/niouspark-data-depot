Therefore, they have to try even harder because studying in this level is not easy. Is it possible for them to have a part-time job while they are college students?

Based on the experience from their part-time job since student period, it can help them to be a considering candidate and finally they will be selected to work in that place. Thus, working as a part-time job is the first step to the second step and eventually to get successful.
