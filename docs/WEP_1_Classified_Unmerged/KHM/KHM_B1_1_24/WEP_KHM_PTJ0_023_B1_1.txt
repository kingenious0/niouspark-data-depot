          I agree with the statement that  it is important for college students to have a part time job  because they can get some money from the jobs to support their study. 

         Part time job is very important, we are getting new experience from work.  it also teaches people about lesson life. for another, collage students should change their part time jobs for six months once because students can know what they want to do or what type of job they love. For example, Lita is a college student, at the first year Lita worked in the restaurant on service for 5 months then she stopped. after that, she worked at the hotel for 6 months then she stopped to work there. at the last, Lita decided to do the volunteer teacher in KNE School and she love this job. Finally, she started to study at university in Khmer subject and then she became a good at Khmer teacher. 

        All of these reason, it shows that part time job is important for college students however you don't forget to spend time on your study. Make sure that you can control your time on study and work. Work hard study hard.
