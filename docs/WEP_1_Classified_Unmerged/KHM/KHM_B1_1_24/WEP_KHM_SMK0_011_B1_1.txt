 Smoking causes a lot of serious diseases to the smokers and second-hand smoker (someone receives smoke from smokers). It is a smart thing to do if we can stop them from smoking in public places like restaurants. We must ban them from smoking from these places and fine them if they against the regulation. In the follow essay, will tell you why we should completely ban smokers to at all restaurants.
	First, smoking in the restaurants can spread the bad smell to the other people who do not like the smell of smoke. It is hard for them to breathe the air into their lung, so some people will the restaurant urgently with unhappy feeling because of those smokers. However, receiving the smoke from smokers also get bad diseases like heart diseases, lung diseases, and also breathing problems to people who get the smoke from those smokers at those restaurants.
	Second, smoking also provides bad model to the young generations. Of course, smoking in front of people is a bad picture to people in public places especially young people. Young people really want to know and want to test what old people show to them, so it is one of the bad role models to young youths when old people or people who smoke everywhere like restaurants. 	Some people might think that it is their rights to smoke everywhere they want because they buy cigarettes by their own money. But I do not agree with that because it is a bad view to young generation and they will copy from those smokers.
	In summary, smoking in public places like restaurants should be banned all restaurants in country because it affects other people's feeling and it is also a bad role model to young generation.
