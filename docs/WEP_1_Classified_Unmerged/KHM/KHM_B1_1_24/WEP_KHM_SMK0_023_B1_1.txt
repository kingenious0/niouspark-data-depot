     I agree smoking should be completely banned in the restaurant and also everywhere in our country. 
   Smoking is very bad for people. Smoke is very dangerous for health of people, it's destroy immune system of user and the people that stay near them also destroy their healthy, too. So, smoking should be ban at all restaurant in the country because there are many people that there to eat or buying some foods, it has affected for healthy. When someone smoking in the restaurant, it's make smell bad in this place. Nobody want to stay near them because they worry about their healthy or their life. You need more money on buying cigarette and also affect your health.​​ Also, smoking causes more problems to many in the family of those who smoke.  Example, when a father smoke cigarretes around the house, the smoke can go around the house, and this mean people smoke too. 

  I hope that the government will not allow to sell the cigarettes on marketing soon. The world can save is start from us. No Smoke No Cry. I think the goverment should create the laws to punish those people who smoke in restaurans. People who do not care about others in the society.
