 Education is the most powerful weapon that can change the world, said Neson Mondola, a former Nobel Peace prize winner and a former president of the South African country. However, education is the long-term investment. Therefore, most parents send the children to pursue their studies till university. There, the students encounter many hurdles that are needed to puzzle out. One of those problem is the expense. Then is it important for them to have a part-time job?
It is very important for a college student to have a part-time job because they will make some more money adding to the money supported by their parents. Some part-time jobs are better paid, so the college student can survive by themselves. Sometimes, they ask their parents to pay for only the school fee and keep the rest of the expense for themselves. For instance, the school fee is 600 US dollars a year, so they ask this amount of money from their parents. Even this money is already hard for the parents to find. Some parents try their best for this money, some decided to sell some of their heritage for this money. What happens, if their children ask for more money for daily expense. It will become another loading for those parents. Otherwise, if they children could find a part-time job, then they can earn some money for supporting themselves, particularly their spending every day for food so on and so for. If it is possible, the students are able to save the money from their part-time job, for also their school free. It will be the best for them.
Concluding, I want to express my support for a college student to have a part-time job in order to support themselves and also to help their parents.
