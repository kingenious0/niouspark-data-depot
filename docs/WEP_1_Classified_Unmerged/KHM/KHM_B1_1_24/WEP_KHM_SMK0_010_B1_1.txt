Smoking is not allowed in some public place, especially in the restaurant. But not all the restaurant owners restrict their customers to obey the rule. Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant in the country. Many people are getting sick if the government couldn't solve this problem.

Restaurant is a public place generally for everybody who enjoy their meal including kids, adult, old people, and sometime sick people. Some of the restaurants are indoor. They use the air conditioner. So, the poison of the cigarettes smoke cannot move away. They are kind of weak people so if they meet the cigarette smoke it will be worst for them. 

The cigarettes produce bad smell fire. Restaurant is a place where we eat. The smell affects the eaters. If it is bad, they will feel disgusting on their meal also. They will lose their want of eating and the restaurant will lose their customer ether. And most of the reason of getting burned is cigarettes fire.

To sum up, there is no positive thing or any advantages of smoking at a public place as a restaurant. The way to stop this bad action is starting from the smoker. They have to change the thinking. They have to care about the other around them not just themselves.
