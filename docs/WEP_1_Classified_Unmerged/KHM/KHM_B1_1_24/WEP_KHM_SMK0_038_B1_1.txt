 Drug has been destroyed the world so far. A lot of people from both the developed countries and developing counties have addicted to it. There are many types of drugs such as stimulants, opioids, benzodiazepines, alcohol, marijuana, over-the-counter drugs. Then tobacco and cigarette are among of them. Do you think banning smoking in the restaurant is good or bad? They can say there are more bad points than good points.
The first bad point is health. Opening a restaurant successfully, the owners have to think of the location and quality of the service and food and decoration. Then thinking of health care for their customers is very important. When you don't permit the smoke to happen to that restaurant, the customers will be satisfied and enjoy their food in a healthy way without being annoyed by the smoke from somewhere in the that restaurant. 
The second one is fresh air. The environment in that restaurant will be spoiled if the smoke flow all over the complex. And then what happens to the people work are working there and also the people who are having meal there. No one can be safe from this matter. Finally, that restaurant will become the slumber, not eating places.
The good point is to attract the bad customers. If you allow the smoke in your restaurant, I am sure that your customers are only the one who are addicted to cigarette, not normal people. Eventually, those customers might cause more problems to happen.
Finally, I want to suggest that all restaurant should be banned the smoke because it might cause health problem for the customers and it might cause the air to be polluted and then it could attract only the addicted drug people to come to that restaurant.
