 The number of university graduates around the world expected to nearly double over this decade and next to reach 300 million by 2030. However, obtaining a part-time job would help them to figure out their financial problem both gaining experience and making network. 
One of the biggest reasons why college students should have a part-time job is to pay their tuition. The university cost has been raising rapidly in recent years and many of the students can't afford, due to the finical problems; therefore, having a part-time job helps them in this case. For example, in the city I am living, there are many college students obtaining a part-job.
Another factor why college students should have a part-time job is to gain experience. For instance, if they are in TESOL major, they can employ the teaching techniques or methods they learn from their part-time classes. By doing this, they are able to investigate their weakness and strength while the others, who do not have a part-time job, have no chance to do so. Additionally, they can also learn other skills such as time management, and communicative skills or they might have chance to join any podiums or workshops assigned by their supervisor. 
	The last reason why part-time job is important is to make a network. While working, they may meet variety of people who come from different  background. Additionally, knowing more people will help them to easily get information of the job or they may have opportunities to work with those people in the future. 
All in all, having a part-time job really impacts on college students' lives since it gives chance to personalize skills they learn from school, build communication skills, gain experiences and obtain job opportunities.
