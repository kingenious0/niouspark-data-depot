Nowadays, many people have problems with their health. Most of them got sick because of smoking. Some other countries have banned smoking in public. On this point, I strongly agree with the view of  Smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. 

Firstly, I think smoking might be harmful to customers who come to eat. Taking a pregnant woman as an example, she comes to eat and inhales the smell of cigarettes which gives the baby and mother problems. 

Secondly, it's bad for the environment in the place to eat and smell inside the restaurant. For example, people come to enjoy their food but smell cigarettes which makes them feel uncomfortable with the smell. 

Lastly, smoking is not good for people who come to spend their money to enjoy time with their family or friends and also it might affect other people whose allergic to the smell. It's caused many problems as well.

Overall, smoking is not good for health and affect more problems for the smoker and inhaler. It can cause a problem for pregnant women and the baby too. Also, it's bad for the environment and it's a bad habit of smoker that's not respect of each other. Smoker should reduce or stop smoke for their family or their future.
