 I absolutely agree to banning smoking but not only at restaurants. Also, another places, especially public places. Because smoking is affecting the people around the country. For example, you are smoking at public places and there are kids around. So, it can affect the kids because their health is not strong. But anyway, the old people are also effects. So, I think smoking completely banned at all restaurants in the country is a good opinion. If  we can ban smoking at restaurants, it will be protecting our health because for those people who can smoke are smoking at restaurant it may affect lungs of people that nearby. Moreover, countries should completely ban restaurants because it can reduce smoking, especially it can be represented for others country to see. As example, my father, and my brother, they smoke every day, and when they smoke the whole family can smoke like them. I want the government to set rules for not smoking, and they are should ban no ciggarette for all peole around the country and the world. 

I see that people who smoke their life is not long, they can die very young, I have noticed many people get sick in the hospital from everywhere in the country. 

In conclusion, the owner of the restaurant, must not allow people to smoke at their restaurant because they can make around to be sick and never get back to work or support their family after all.
