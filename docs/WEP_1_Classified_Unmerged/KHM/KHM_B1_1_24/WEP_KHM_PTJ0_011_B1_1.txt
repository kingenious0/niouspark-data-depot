 University life is really important for all of those who just graduate grade 12 and want to learn more about their favorite skill. It is the time for them to go far away from their houses in order to study in the city. They are going to spend a lot on their studies. It is essential for students to have part-time jobs during their university lives.
	First, working as part-time job is essential for students to learn about the societies and gain experience. Of course, it is good for all of those students to train a lot about the jobs that are related to their school subjects or skills as well as receive plenty of experiences and learn what the society is.
	Second, working the part-time job also help students on their study spend. As we know, university students have to live apart from their parents by their own, so all of spend is on them. For example, they have to pay for school feel, rent room, buy food, gasoline vehicles, so it is good for them to earn some profit to support their daily spend. 
	Some people might think that working during their university life affects their studies. I do not agree with that I think we can get many benefits of working part-time. As I mentioned, in the essay above, it provided experience, learned about the society and help the spend of students.
	In total, working part-time job during university life is beneficial. It gives us experience, learn about something in society and also provides help to students of their spend on studies.
