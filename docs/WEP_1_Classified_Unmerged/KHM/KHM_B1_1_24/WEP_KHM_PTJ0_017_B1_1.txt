 Of course we agree with collage students to have a part-time job to find work experience and money to support their study and work. It's very important because part time is a good way to help them, family and support their study. I think they should have a part-time job.
Most students who study in university or collage should to have a part-time job because in their collage life need a lot of expend on their own daily life
Part time job is the best way to find work experience. It's very important, when they graduate collage, they need to find  a full time job. So when they had a work experience it'll help them on their work. Example: While they study at university  they worked as an English assistant teacher with the native teacher.Can have a quality, teach and it's a good opportunity to get a high salary and become a professional teacher.
Second, part-time job can make them have a high income and it's can help on their expend for rent house, food, drinks, clothes, electric bill, water bill, skincare…. So when they don't have work all expend are on their family, but when they have a part-time job, they can pay it by themselves or get a little bit money from their family. So it's the way that can help their parents.
In conclusion I would like to say that part-time job is very important to help them on daily life and collage life. I hopefully students in the collage can find a good job and get more experience from their part time job and full time job to success in their life. In the end I would like to tell them should to manage time in the way that both your study and work won't get affected.
