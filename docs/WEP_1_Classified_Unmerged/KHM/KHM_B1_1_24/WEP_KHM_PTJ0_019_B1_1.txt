 
 Working part-time is a very good way that can help students to have more abilities and skills to improve their knowledge and can earn more money while they are in high school or university. I agree with the view that  College students need to have a part-time job.    

Firstly, in our society nowadays, there are many companies and many workplaces that are mostly working by students who are in college. For Example, Students are working as an assistant teachers in many private schools, hotels, and restaurants. Especially for the poor students who are from the countryside and looking for jobs to support themselves and also their studying.  

Secondly, working part-time jobs are an important part in which the students can gain more experience that can help them easy to apply for new jobs after finishing college. For instance, in each company or working place entry requires at least one year of experience for each employee.

Finally, most of those part-time jobs are related to their skills which can help to improve their communication skills and get more knowledgeable about society.

In conclusion, The good things about working part-time jobs for students are improving more abilities, communication skills, and knowledge and letting the students understand how to manage themselves and their time while they are studying and know more about society.
