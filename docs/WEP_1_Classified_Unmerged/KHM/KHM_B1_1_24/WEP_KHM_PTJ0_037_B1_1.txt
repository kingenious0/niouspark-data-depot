 Investing in studying is a long-term effect; that's why a lot of parents send their children to as high level as possible in a hope that their future will be bright and help them when they are old in return. Otherwise, the expense of the school fee become the main concern for both parents and students themselves. Finally, some of them decide to look for some part-time jobs for the income while studying.
The first benefit of having a part time job for college students is to earn money to help their parents paying for the school fee and their daily expenses. If they move to the capital for studying in this level, they have to rend a room, buying food and other households. Money from this part-time job goes vital.
The second benefit from it is to reduce stress from their tough time at school because normally their lecturers assign them a variety of homework and assignment to do. When the over-loading of this work and the deadline come closer, they will feel stressful. However, a part-time job might be helpful for them.
The third benefit is for making new friend besides their classmates. This might be strange, but it is true. In this work place, the students might find better and right friends who can help them whenever they complete course from their schools. As a result, it might be helpful for them either. Thus, it becomes a chance that students could catch up.
Last but not least, having a part-time job for college student is good because this is their perfect chance to earn money. Then they might feel freer and finally they can make more potential friends. As mentioned above, I motivate the college students to explore jobs while studying because it is completely necessary.
