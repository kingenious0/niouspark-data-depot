          A part-time job is essential for university students. Studying in universities is focusing specifically on the major that related to our future job and we also need to spend a lot of money to pay for our study. If the university is far away from where we live, so we have to rent a house and we have to pay for it each months also for the food everyday. It's not enough at all if we only depend on our family to pay for it. In order to solve this problem, we have to find a part-time job to earn the money to support our study at university. Moreover, having a part-time job can also help university students to earn more experience in working and it allows them to get to know new people in their work place. Especially, if their part-time jobs are fit with the major that they are studying at university, so they can apply everything that they have learned in real life, and they can improve themselves. 
             In conclusion, I strongly agree that part-time job is crucial for all the colleges students to find new experience or opportunities to improve themselves. They can also earn the money to support their study and their living. Part-time job is also allowed them to get to know more people in society and themselves.
