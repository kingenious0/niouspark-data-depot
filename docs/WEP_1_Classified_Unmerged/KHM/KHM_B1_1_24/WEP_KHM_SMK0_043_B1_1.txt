Smoking happens almost everywhere all around the world, especially in the restaurant. It has a terrible effect on the smokers and also people who stay around. I strongly agree with the topic  Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country  thanks to three reasons.
First of all, smoking can cause a bad smell. For instance, when people smoke the cigarettes, they collect the smoke that come from the cigarettes into their mouths so that the smoke will cover their teeth and breathing system that can really make them have a bad breath for the smokers themselves and also people who stay around them when they talk with one another in the restaurants and other places. In addition, smoking can cause a lungs cancer for smokers and the people around that come to have a meal in the same restaurant. To illustrate, when you smoke the cigarettes, the smoke that comes from the cigarettes will be absorbed into your lungs that is an awful problem that makes you and the people around you have a lungs cancer. This kind of disease can ruin people health from day to day until people die from constant coughing. Last but not least, smoking can destroy people 's interest in having a meal. To demonstrate, the bad smell that comes from the cigarettes can really interrupt people's feeling during their delicious meal. This problem can produce the argument between the smokers and the customer who have a meal in the same place.
In conclusion, I completely agree with the topic above that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country due to the above- mentioned reasons, such as causing a bad smell, causing a lungs cancer, and destroying people's interest during having a meal.
