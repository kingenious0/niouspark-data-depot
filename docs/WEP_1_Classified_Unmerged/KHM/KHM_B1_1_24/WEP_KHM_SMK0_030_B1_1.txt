 I agree to reduce smoking because we know that there is not good for our health and also smoking  effect to our life and society. 
Smoking is very dangerous for recover people and the society, we know when people smoking is very bad for the society that has many people smoking this country runs slowly. 
The people who smoking  they cannot life without it they will smoke it any time and cigarette very effect to our country and society. Especially, it is effect to the family they always have conflict with each other. Moreover, they have to spend money for buying. It very effect to the day life. For example, if we smoking at home or at the public place when we smoking it very disturbing our neighbor.
However, Smoking it is very effective to the environment and effect to the young generation, As now day, very young people smoking when they have party at their school or at the other place. So it is very bad situation in our country right now.  
That's said all people should reduce to smoking we also have the law about smoking,One more thing, we have to check the identity card when the young generation to buy the cigarettes or smoking at the restaurant we should not sell to them. Therefore, we can reduce the people smoking day by day. 
In conclusion I would say that the government should do more active to encourage people to reduce their smoking the movement should make the strike policy for buy or smoking.
If the rule strike it will reduce the people to smoking and they will get the good health. 

Thanks.
