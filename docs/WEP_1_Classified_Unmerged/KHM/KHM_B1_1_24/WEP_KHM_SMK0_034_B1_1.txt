 Restaurants are the places for eating, so it normally designs and decorates in the standard of the target customers; it might be local and international. However, it normally looks so clean and sanity. Thus, smoking should be banned.
At first, banning smoking in the restaurants might cause the environment clean, particularly the air that can make the customers feel relieved to breathe and enjoy their food. More importantly, it might cause the customers feel close to each other.
Second, banning smoking in the restaurants will not cause the concept of discrimination to one another in those sites. You know? In a restaurant, when someone smokes, other people will move away because they cannot stand for that smoke longer time. It is my experience; I always walk away when somebody smokes nearby. It makes me feel dizzy. Without smoking there, people might build up more relationship and that place will become the warming place for eating.
Finally, banning smoking in the restaurants will make people in general and customers in particular get healthier because the impact of smoking is not only the smoker, but also the absorber. Therefore, when one restaurant conducts this ban and customers love it, it might influence to other restaurants in that region and also in the whole country.
Concluding, I definitely agree with the ban of smoking in the restaurants, not only in the my mother country, but also around the whole to take part with the healthy program of the world health organization that is promoting health care every year to all the countries. Without smoking, the world will look even more beautiful and natural.
