Knowledge has known as an important key for people. No matter about age, gender, or living conditions everyone still has the opportunity to study. Besides that, as an adult, we have to work while studying. I strongly agree with the view of  It is important for college students to have a part-time job. 

Firstly, I think a part-time job might help college students to become confident. When they work probably can be in socializing with others. For example, an introverted person is scared to be social but they have to face it. 

Secondly, gaining more experience based on their major or can understand much faster during work and study at the same time. For an instant, students learn about TEFL Major at university and they volunteer in community or school to gain more experience for their major and they can gain more credits to apply for a job when they graduate. 

Lastly, while studying they can control or manage their finances which money that they earn by themselves. They don't need to ask their guardian for the money. Besides that, they can save up the money to pay their school fees or living condition while living apart from their family. 

In conclusion, college students should have a full-time job or part-time job while studying. They can gain more confidence to face socializing, experiences to find a better job and be able to manage their living condition.
