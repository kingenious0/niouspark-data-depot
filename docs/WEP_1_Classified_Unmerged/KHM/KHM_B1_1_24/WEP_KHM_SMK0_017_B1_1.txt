 I don't agree about that because people can smoking everywhere and every time When they want. 
We know smoking isn't good for health, life and country. Smokers don't smoke only at the restaurants, they can smoke at market, home, library, museum, public place…Smoking should be completely banned at public place. Smoking is very dangerous for people and country.
Smoker can't live without cigarette. They need to pay money for it. Nowadays mostly people all over the world specially people who live Asean have a cigarette with them all the time when they travel, eating, on the public place. We know smoking can give a bad smell, bad for health environment and can make brain disease, lung disease, heart disease, weak bones and yellow teeth. All these can make you waste money for hospital, time. One more it can make people around you get bad smell bad environment. Example: Public places have a lot of people smoking. What do you think? I think they don't want to visit because Environment is bad. One country don't have foreign come to visit it can make low economic that can't develop the country.
That said all the country should completely have banned the public places in the country this rule can reduce smoke in the country. It's good for public place that can make people who don't smoke want to visit, happy with travel, meeting and get fresh air.
Inconclusion I would say that the government or prime minister should to do more to encourage people to reduce their smoke in the public place. For other people and them get a good health don't waste money, time and it the best way to help atmosplere.
