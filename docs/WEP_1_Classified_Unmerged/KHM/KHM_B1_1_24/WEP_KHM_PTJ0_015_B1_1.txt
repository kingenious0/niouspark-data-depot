             Both studying and working are always important. Nowadays many people are continuing their study at university after graduated from high school. Because they believe that the higher education they get, the more opportunity they can find a better job. That is why most of the college students they decided to work and study at the same time. I totally agree with the view that  It is important for college students to have a part time job. 
            Working during attending school provides more benefits to the student. First, it helps them improve their social skill. Especially, people who are introvert. They will change automatically. When they meet a lot of people from difference field they will get used to people and understand more how the world is like. Social connection can allow students to build or create relationship and friendship. Moreover, students can also build their confidence and braveness to talk or to express their ideas and show their real ability. Second, they can use their budget that they get from work to support their study or daily needs. For instance, they can use that money to pay for school fees. Also, they can even support their daily expenses such as food clothes and room that you rent for living. Working also facilitate family responsibilities. Third, time management also one of the reasons why students should have job to do. Especially, students who are working full time.  
              In my opinion, it is relevant for college students to have a job while in school. It makes them become stronger and they can challenge themselves in that hard situation. Also, when you apply for jobs after graduation, you can add your relevant work background in your resume, which may improve your chances of finding a position in your business.
