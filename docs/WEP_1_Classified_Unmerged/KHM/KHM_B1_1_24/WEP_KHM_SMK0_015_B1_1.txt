           Cigarette is known as a sharp weapon which taking many people's life. Especially, those who are using it. Most of people are smoking because of stress from work or personal problems. They think that smoking can solve those problems. But they forget to think that it gives bad effect to their health. They not only hurt themselves but people around. So, I strongly agree with the statement said  Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. 
          First reason why I totally agree with that view is smoking causes health problems not only yourselves but people around you. It can lead people to die when you are using too much. Because smoking can cause lung cancer, heart disease when the smoke goes into your body. Moreover, when people are not healthy, they will find difficulties of completing their job. As long as, they will face losing job. Beside this, smoking can also effects to unborn baby. They will be born with disability. Second, smoking in restaurant can also damage in the taste of food. Customers will not enjoy their meal and the taste of food will be terrible while they are breathing in the cigarette smoke.  To conclude, smoking must be banned not only at all the restaurants but other public places. I think it is an immoral act to smoke in public. Because not all the people like it. To reduce the amount of people who die and avoid losing costumer from the restaurant, owner should provide a good place which is far away from people for them to smoke. Health is the most important thing for people which you can not buy. When you are healthy enough, you can do whatever you want such as help developing your country.
