 Today, smoking is a main issue that people around the world are very concerned about, it has a huge impact on human health, especially the elderly, pregnant women and children.  Most of these activities are always available on restaurants.

First, smoking in public places and restaurant should be banned because these two areas are overcrowded and can affect people in these areas as well. It greatly affects those around us because it smells bad and can make others feel bad. for example when you are go eat out or in the resturant and someone are smoking nearby you, it will make you feel bad and do not hungry anymore.
Secondly, smoking not only affects the smoker himself but also those nearby.  For example, in restaurants. Smoking being banned is a good thing that smokers should be follow because it shows knowledge, dignity, responsibility, and respect for each other's rights. I agree with the topic because smoking has a profound effect on the health of people directly and indirectly in the world.

In conclusion, Smoking in the restaurants should be banned and smokers should be aware of the circumstances as well as understand health issues, respect their rights, and not hurt the feelings of those around them.
