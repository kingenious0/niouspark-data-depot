      In society nowadays college students are mostly working. Because they need to support their family and themselves. So, as a student they cannot have a full-time job. Because they must spend their time studying too. For me, I think students should have a part time job. In addition, study must spend a lot of things such as food electric water and other materials things. Therefore, the family cannot help them all time. Anyway, it important for college students to have a part time job. Moreover, the students can also get new experiences while they are studying so that when they graduate, they can have a good job. Especially fit with the major that they have been chosen. And knew what kind of job they absolutely love. Also know how hard the work is. May people in my family have a job when they study, and they can help themselves when they study at the same time, I want to hav a job too as soon as I can, so that I can help myself for study at the university. 

In conclusion, I think univesity students should have their part-time job, but not the full-time job as they need to put more time for learning, and if they have full-time job, they will get anything from learning at school. 
So all students should get only part-time while they are learnign at the university.
