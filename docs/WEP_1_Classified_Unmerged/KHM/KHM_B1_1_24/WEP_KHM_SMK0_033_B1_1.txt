 People have their own habit. Some prefer playing sports during their free time, but others don't. Some prefer reading books, but others don't. Moreover, some people have got a habit of smoking tobacco and cigarette during their free time, in particular, some people smoke whenever they need. Then, is it good to ban smoking in the restaurant, where people get to for eating? To me, I answer YES based on some reasons as mentioned below.
People smoke thank to their habit, but some smoke because of their addiction. However, other people smoke because they think it is civilized and to attract other people, especially someone whom they fall in love. All the purposes of this smoke will impact to their health as a result. The World Health Organization also warn about that. Cigarettes are available everywhere now. It seems convenient for the smokers to find. The price of cigarette is seasonable, so it is easy for the smoker to afford their money to buy. On the other hand, a restaurant is a place for eating. An eating place should be nice, clean and sanitation because everyone wants to enjoy their meal. Furthermore, banning smoke in that place is also an attraction and sometimes if the service is good; food is yummy, the environment is fresh, but most people smoke there. Sooner or later, that place will become ugly and disgusting. Then no one wants to go and eat there. 
Finally, I want to encourage all restaurants put and apply this banning firmly in order to attract the customers and improve the health of the people in that community. As a result, people in that community will be healthier.
