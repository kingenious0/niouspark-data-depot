 People can be alive because they have enough things to eat. Smoking is smoke food for some people around the world. There are many kinds of cigarettes produced to respond to the need of the smokers. However, not all people smoke and not all people love smoking. This is how it should be banned in some places, especially the place to eat like restaurants.
When the smoke is banned in the restaurants, it attracts more people to come and enjoy their meal in that restaurant. Many people want find the place with fresh air to eat, so no smoking makes the air become fresh. When the air become fresh, they can breathe naturally and enjoy their meal in the healthy way.
Then, when it is banned, the people who work there will work smoothly without any obstacles take place. They can focus more on their work and all the personnel will be healthier. As a result, the restaurants will improve and the service will make all customers feel convenient. Finally, that place will receive more customers because of this reason.
Next, we can save many lives from smoking, not only people who come to eat in this restaurant, but also influence to other relevant ones to the people who come to eat here. When many places are banned, the smokers will meet difficulty in finding and place for smoking. As the result, they will try to reduce smoking and finally they will stop smoking successfully. Then when they stop smoking, the people from their family will not be impacted by this case and all people around the community will be developed.
Finally, smoking in the restaurants should be banned firmly, so to me I completely agree to the topic because there are many good things as mentioned above.
