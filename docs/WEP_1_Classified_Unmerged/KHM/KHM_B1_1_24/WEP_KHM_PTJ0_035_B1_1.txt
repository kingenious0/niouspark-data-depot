 Collage students are normally busy with school work; they most spend their focusing on that in a hope the result of their study would be great and then they are able to find a good job with high salary. Anyway, What is the reason why they need to have a part-time job since when they haven't finished their study yet?
The first reason is that they can practice what they have learnt from school to the real situation, not only theory. For example, they already learnt about one teaching method called task-based learning. Then, they might use what task-based learning is to the real classroom of their part-time job. After that, they will evaluate what they learnt and real apply in order that they can see the strength and weakness of teaching and learning using task-based learning method. Finally, they might improve their weakness. As a result, they will become a good teacher in the future because they have chance to improve their profession since they are college students.
The second reason is that they will meet the problems and try to find the better solutions in advance. It means that when they practice a lot of problems they might meet. Then they will discuss with their colleagues or their lecturers to seek for the solutions. 
Last but not least, if collage students are spare their time doing both studying and having a part-time job, that would be great for them because they can improve their skills before being in the real society. Their future would be bright with a job with a good salary and they will be successful in their jobs.
