 The cost of higher education is really big problem for some student who are not rich from families. Some students who live far from families need to rent a place to stay. For some, a part-time job can be able way to help them to spend for the rent and food. However, there are both advantages and disadvantages to balancing work and school.

         Having a part-time job can provide students with work experience and help them develop important skill such as communication, teamwork and heard work. In addition, earning from work would help them not to worry a bout the money for spending.

         Working while in university can also make them live independent from parents. Sometime they can help parents not to send money to support them. In addition, some students would be happy with a part-time job because a part-time job provide them such as clothes and food that they want.

         Anyway, working while in university must be depend on school schedule. Some of students may not study well because they are tired from work. Some other students may missed the class and do not join group assignment. In case some parents may not allowed their children to work.

         In conclusion, having a part-time job can be provide them both way. With valuable experience and the money support it's also very important to balance the time between work and study. In my opinion, the students should have a part-time job. A part-time job would help them to earn money and get good experience. I have seen a lot of people succeed from work and study at the same time.
