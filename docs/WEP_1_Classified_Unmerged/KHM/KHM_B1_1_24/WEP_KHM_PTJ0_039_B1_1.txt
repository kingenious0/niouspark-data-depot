 To develop one country, human resource is highly required because everything is from this point of view. Qualified human resource can be the strongest basic for lifting one country to be improved, particular this technology era. Human resource comes from education where students are trained to be educated. During studying, is it good if the students have a part-time job?
To me, there are pros and cons for this question. Let me raise some good points of having that job.
The first good point is that the students will earn some money to help pay for their daily life need, or with that money, they are able to pay for their school fee. That would be great for them because this can make not to worry much on that case.
The second point is that the students learn how to communicate with other people in the real society. During working, they will be with other people in their workplace, not only their classmates. Then getting well or not so well with those people depends mainly on their latent.
In contrast, having a part-time job for collage students might make their study be back because they cannot focus on their study 100 percent. They have to spare their time for working and the rest of their time for studying. Sometimes, they sleep in the class because over-loading work from their part-time job.
To make the essay short, I think having a part-time job for collage student is so vital; the reasons are mentioned above. Thus, I want to see collage students could schedule their time for both studying and working. Then, everything will go smoothly. At the end, they will be successful, broth their study and job. This is what most of the students want.
