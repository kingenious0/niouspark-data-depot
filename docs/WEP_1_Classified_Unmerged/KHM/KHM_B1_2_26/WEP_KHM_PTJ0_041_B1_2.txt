 Occupation is a part of every person's life. We work to earn money to support our daily expenses such as food, utilities, rent, tuition fee…etc. I think it is essential because we need to learn and practice it in reality. The theory is not enough to make us better. 
Firstly, working while studying benefits you in both the short and long term.  For example, it can build your self-confidence, gain experience in the field you are studying, and the opportunity to put yourself while you are learning to practice. 
Second of all, learning and working at the same time can enhance knowledge and skill. Moreover, you can earn more profit to support yourself and your family as well. You will understand when you try your best to do your job. Here it comes to the result you have got is the best moment ever. Life is meaningful when you go through hardship. Nobody wants to face it really, but we cannot avoid it no matter what. 
Most importantly, no one is willing to accept a person who is not showing much effort in what they want to achieve. Working expresses who you are and your characteristic. After you finish college, employers will read through your resume. Employees are expected to have some work experience or internships. If your curriculum vitae or cover letter is nothing, you will not be able to get a job easily. 
Finally, having a job is not bad for your study because some students wait until they finish the university and still rely on their parents. So, it can show that you are not hard-working enough for yourself and the company you work for. 
To sum up, college students have part-time and even full-time jobs that are better for them based on self-confidence, independence, and opportunity.
