 
Smoking is not good for many people, so I really agree to reduce who smoke in restaurants. We know that smoking is not good for our health and effects to many people living around. For example, Smoker always has disease with yourself and other people like destroys the lung and make their life are very bad. More importantly, people smoke cannot live without it because they spend a lot of money to buy something that relate to smoke like cigarettes. For example, they cannot take money to support their family because they need to smoke very time. One especially thing, Smoking in the restaurants makes a bad that people hate you and their feeling is not good when nearby smoker. For example, in the restaurants have many people to eat food or something, so they don't need people smoke there because they need comfortable place for them. The last but not least, smoking effect to polluted environment that doesn't make Oxygen enough for people breathing every day. And one more point, for country has many people smoke, so that country cannot development fast. And there are full of polluted on the world. In conclusion, in the restaurants we must stop to smoke because it is not good for health, pay to much money, and have a lot polluted on the Atmosphere. So, Government should tell who always smoke to stop and everyone don't try to smoke. We join to reduce smoke to development country and good health.
