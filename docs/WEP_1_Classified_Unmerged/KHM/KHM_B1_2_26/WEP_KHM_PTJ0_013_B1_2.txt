 
University students should have a part-time job that can keep them better. Having a part-time job is beneficial for them because this also helps to improve their skills from university. On other hand, their talent has increased.  I truly agree with this topic that   It is important for college students to have a part-time job  . 

 Firstly, receiving a job during educating is the best choice for students. It is the best opportunity to figure out where they are. Students can improve this by taking what they have learnt to use in their work. Moreover, some students pick up the majors that they love, they can find a job that matches with the majors that they're learning.  For example, accounting students have to look for a job that matches with their major like they can work as accountants.

Secondly, having a job can support you. It can serve in our living as well as studying. In addition, we receive both experience and financial experience that can keep you better from being jobless even if you are a bachelor student in a university. students can take this chance to develop themselves by looking for a job to help them to be in good condition one day. People can look for a job that can support their learning by getting the salary from it. For instance, some students who are working can charge the school fee themselves. 
Some points of view still think that having a job during studying in university is not important. 

In conclusion, everyone should get a job for ourselves because it is a good solution that may help your life. In addition, we all also can build our skills from something that we are doing. Last thing, some companies may require your experience than.
