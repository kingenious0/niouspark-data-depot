 I agree that smoking cigarettes should be banned in Cambodia and there are many reasons why this would be useful for us to take action.

Firstly, it would protect our health and especially to protect the health of non-smokers, such as our students, family members, and so on. Secondhand smoke is the main risk factor for lung cancer, heart disease, and other respiratory diseases. Banning smoking in public places such as restaurants would help to protect the health of nonsmokers who are exposed to people who don't like smoking and some customers just go to have their meals, they receive the awful smell from the people who go there to release their stress by smoking, so it will be harmful to others.
Secondly, it would reduce the number of smokers. Some people who went to eat food usually complain to other people who like smoking cigarettes in restaurants, because when those smokers smoke, the smoke spread rapidly around there, then the non-smokers will get the smoke from the smokers. In addition, it will surely affect to their health either. 
It would save lives. Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in Cambodia. Banning smoking would help to save lives by reducing the number of people who die from smoking-related diseases.
 A complete ban on smoking in public places would be a significant step forward in the fight against tobacco.

In conclusion, smoking cigarettes in restaurants in Cambodia should be completely banned. I believe that the benefits of a smoking ban in Cambodia far outweigh the costs. I urge the Cambodian government to take action to ban smoking in public places and protect the health of its citizens.
