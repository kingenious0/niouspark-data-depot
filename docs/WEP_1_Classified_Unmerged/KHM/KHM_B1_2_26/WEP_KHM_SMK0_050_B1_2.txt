 Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
I completely agree with this topic because if we have banned about smoking can help some part of rescue the world. 

People should not be smoking in a restaurant because it is the place to serve meal and drink, if we smoking there the smell will be spreading around and not good for all the people, not all the people like the smell of smoke. 

And the smell of smoke can cause people headaches or vomit while they have the meal. 
And also bad image over there. 

They should have a private place for smoker, and not spreading the smell around the  meal table. 
Anyway smoking is not good for body health, waste of money, destroy our brain and teeth, hair, bad smell, show bad image to the young generator. 
On behalf of a person, I honestly I really want all the countries reduce of smoking or stop smoking especially in my country Cambodia. 
I thought if we do not have smoking we can save our money, save time, have a good health, good teeth,  good communication and goo relationship with our family, too. 
In conclusion, we should ban all the restaurants in our country in order to prevent them from making awful environments
