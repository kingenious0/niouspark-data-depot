       Smoking cigarettes will cause you in many way of health problems. Nicotine is the main additive substance in cigarettes and other forms of tobacco. It's a drug that affect many parts of your body including your brain, your liver and your heart also. Smoking in restaurants does not affect only the smoker but for people around the smoker too. It's not safe at all especially for pregnant women, young people and other people in restaurants. It seem like a bad influences for them. They probably feel stress, not relax and can't feel enjoy with their meals. You should have to go out and smoke. It is the only way that you have to show respect to other people in restaurants if you really want to smoke. 

      Finally, I believe smoking in restaurants cannot be completely banned but there can be a middle path. The restaurants should have separate smoking zones. This way, non-smokers will not have any problems and smokers can also relax.
