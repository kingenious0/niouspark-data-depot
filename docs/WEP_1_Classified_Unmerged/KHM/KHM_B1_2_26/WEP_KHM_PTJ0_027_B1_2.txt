Part-time work is not so bad when university students work part-time, this is for many reasons we do not know, such as: 1, is due to the lack of continuing education in the university, the parents are not able to afford, so the students have to find part-time work to increase income. 2, Some students want to have experience, so free from school hours, they look for work to gain experience and to earn part of the income. 3, Some students want to know the outside world better and to get new experiences and new skills when working to the outside world. 4, Some students who leave for part-time work because they think they are big and they can earn money to spend on their own without having to spend their parents' money anymore. All in all, the part-time work of university students has many reasons we do not know. Part-time work has both positive and negative effects on university students. The downside is that students are very tired, sometimes students may not follow some lessons, especially that may fall asleep during class. The good thing is to be able to get a new experience, new skills, know the society to another level, especially to be able to earn your own money and help your family. These are all reasons for students' part-time work, both good and bad. For me, I do not decide whether it is important or not for students to work part-time. I ask in the middle because doing is all reasonable.
