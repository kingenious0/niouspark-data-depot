I agree with that, no matter where you are, everyonr wants to have fun and comfortable. If the pleces that they go make them feel unhealthy they do not want to again and the seller fall down. Everyone has right to breathe in clean air when they diner at a restaurant, so all diners can enjoy a smok-free meal, smoking must be banned from all restaurants. No smoke is trying to save to get nearer to death. Smoking should be banned in restaurants it is a good idea, because of health risks in poses to both employees and costomers. Secondhand smoke has been proven to cause cancer and other serious health problems, it not fair to expose restaurant staff and pattrons to these damgers. In addition, smoking in enclosed spaces can kead to unpleasant odors. Smoking in restaurants is a matter of protecting public health and safety, and promoting a clean and pleasant dining experience for all pattrons. If smoker have made a choise to poison their life and develop various diseases, people who do not smoke have chosen to live healthier and shoud not be exposed. Finally, I hope all of you will think of a good things first, no doing anything that is bad for society, especially smoking when there are children around. So should be stop it immediately. If you know it is not good and you are still doing it, then you are on the wrong way.
