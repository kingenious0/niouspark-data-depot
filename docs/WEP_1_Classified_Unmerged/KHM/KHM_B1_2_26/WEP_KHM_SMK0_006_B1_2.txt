 As we know, smoking is spreading around the world now. I strongly agree with the topic that  smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country .
	Firstly, the effects of smoke on people's health. Smoking is not good for health it is a cause of lung cancer, heart disease, and other diseases. When smokers carry these viruses they need a lot of money to spend on treatment. For example, all the restaurants that have smoking will affect children, old people, and the health of those people who eat there.
	Secondly, related to air pollution, as smoking increases, the heat gets hotter, destroys greenhouse gases, and also makes the weather change and some effects such as wildfire, affect the skin, and hot weather. As proof, every day the weather was hot with high temperatures which causes many people to have health problems and other issues.
	Next, smoking in restaurants can show about ethics or personality of these people. For instance, smoking in restaurants while eating or talking with a partner who comes with you means you do not respect them and do not give them their worth, and smoke will also be annoying and affects them.
	Finally, as mentioned above smoking has a lot of disadvantages, and I agree all restaurants in the country should ban smoking.
