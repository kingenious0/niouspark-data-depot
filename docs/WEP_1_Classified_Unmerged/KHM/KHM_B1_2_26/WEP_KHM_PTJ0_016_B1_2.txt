 
Generally, it is much better for students who are learning in a university and also get jobs to improve skills. Similarly, some students are free after class but others are working. I strongly agree with the view that  It is important for college students to have a part-time job. 

Firstly, I think that it is best for them to work during free time after class because working can help them to improve their abilities. For example, from the data in modern country like Japan we can see a lot of students who are learning there having job to cooperate the education. Then the qualities of students in this country are also much better because they know about the way for practicing their theories.

Secondly, I feel that working for college students are increasing stronger human resources. When they cooperate education and working they can use both the theories and practicing to force with the problems. For instance, most of good jobs and managers as well in a society need human resources having both education and experiences in order to work for them. As the result, the company moves on well and society also becomes a stronger one by education workers.


Some people might say that learning in a university as well as having jobs for students are not good but I think they are completely mistaken because of finding money and studying are much better to go on together.

In conclusion, I truly believe that college students who have job and education together are much better such as helping them to improve their abilities and making them to become the strong human resources. It would be better for us to study hard and finding job to support our education in order to make us full of skills with achievement goal.
