I agree that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are many reason for these, smoke is a major health hazard. It can cause cancer, heart disease, and problem. Banning smoking in restaurents would protect the health of non smokers. smoking can make it unpleasant for non smokers to eat in a restaurent. the smell of smoke can be strong and lingering, and it can make it difficult t breathe. Banning smoking would pleasant for everyone. i belive that the benefit of banning smoking in restaurents outweigh the drawbacks. one more thing is banning smoking in the restaurent would be send a massage that smoking is not acceptable in public places. this could help to reduce the number of people who are exposed to secondhand smoke. many countries alreadyhave laws that ban smoking in public places, such as bar night clubs and work places. And finlaly the gavenment must have an afective rule for smoker exspacally the childrend that age under 18 please do not sell for them. smoking free society is one where everyone can enjoy clean air, regardless of weather they smoke or not banning smoking in a restaurents would be a step towards creating a smoke free society.
