   As I am a student who used to effected with the smoking of smoke I agree to cut down or reduce smoking in restaurants because flame of smoking is causing people health and especially children. And also smoking affects our life and our country.
Smoking is such a sharp salience weapon which can cause illness and also give bad effectively to our environment also to our country. The most people still keep smoking up even they know when they smoking is a bad polluted environment. For a country that has many people smoking those countries could not growth well. On the other hand, smoking causes the climate change badly from every movement and country full of uncomfortable air to breath. Nowadays, the number of smoking is increasing up stronger in the   restaurants. They smoke every time. More importantly, smoking is causing lungs, hart damage and effected to people around them also. For example, at my work place in the restaurant there one of the guest smokes and the smoking flow everywhere and I couldn't breathe well and other who sit near him can't stay.   The restaurants smell really bad. Smoking in restaurant or in public area makes people feel unsafely and uncomfortable to their life because that smoke damage our lung and our life.  
I could say that smoking is very dangerous to people, animal and our environments. I think if smoker can cut down smoking our country will run well, people can live longer and our environment clean.

In conclusion I would suggest to people who like to smoke must cut down their smoking. The government should make the rule for smoker and not allowed to smoke in the restaurant or in public area.
Moreover, we should be a good model for the next generation. Don't smoke if your community clean.
