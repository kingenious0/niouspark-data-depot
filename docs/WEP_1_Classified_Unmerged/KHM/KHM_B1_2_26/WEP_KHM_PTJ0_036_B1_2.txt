 Students have to struggle all the tackles from the primary school until university because studying is not easy and hunting the knowledge is even harder. When they were young, their parents will take a good care for everything, but when they grew elder, there are some cases that they have to be responsible by themselves. When they grow up, their needs are more. Thus, they have to know how to respond to those needs. Eventually, having a parti-time job is important.
The reason is that they will learn how to be flexible in the real society and how to socialize nationally. This case will cause them to learn even more than in the classroom. Here, they might meet both good people and bad people, whom they have to be cautious for. Making friends with good people, they will bring them bright future. Otherwise, making friends with bad, those evil people will lead them to get addicted to the drug, or persuade them not to go to school. Finally, those bad friends will lead them to be failed for their present and the future. On the other hand, the students will make some money from this part-time job. Then they will use that money for the personal purpose. It would be absolutely helpful.
To make the story short, I want to see the students have jobs to do even they are still students. Having a part-time job during studying is very important for them in many reason as mentioned above. However, do not the study because their study might be declined because they don't have enough time or they focus too much on the work, not their study. If they can do that, I hope they will have the bright future.
