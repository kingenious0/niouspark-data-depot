 Is it important for college students to have a part - time job? 
However, in the social Cambodia or such as the other countries, for the students that studying at college. 
Of course, Should have their part time job because working is important for all of us to get more experiences and knowledge outside the school. 
Specially to get money to pay for the foods and drink, school fee, flat, cloths and keep our life balance to live and running after college. If not, when we finish college and we do not have any experiences we also really hard to get a job to make living, too. 
So in my opinion, having a part - job during studying is good idea, learning more how to work after school, how to get money step by step, get a relationship, communication at work, team work, share our knowledge and education from school to workplace or from workplace to school. 
When we are finish at college we know how to work and have quite well experiences  apply to other job. After colleg if we want to aply for new job will be easy for us, because eduation plush experiences can be the first anwer for the require job. 
Finally, of course I agree having a part - job during college students.
