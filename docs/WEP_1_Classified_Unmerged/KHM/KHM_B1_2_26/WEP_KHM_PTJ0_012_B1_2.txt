Nowadays, many students graduate from high school and move on to university. Most of the students are studying and working to supply what their need. Not everyone has a good life, so some students have to find job and doing that while studying also has a lot of good things. Firstly, I think having a part-time job saves a lot of money on students' study materials, food, accommodation and transportation. Those jobs can greatly help make sure an experience in working, living in outside society and can also train their minds to confident. In addition, when they work on their skills, they can better understand what they know, need, love and do it from their heart. Have ability to take vare of themselves and lean how to manage the time. It is the best way to get connection out there actively meeting people either through networking events or passively through student jobs, get meet some really amazing people, will earn an income, making valuable connections and relationships. So I would say having a part-time jobs is good way because it is useful in family to help their revenue. When we need to spend more them expensive materials, we also have income to deal with not much worry. Students must be able to have great time management skills to survive the schedule and maintain a good social life.
