    For my opinion part-time job for college students are good for some reason. 45 percent of college student that paid for their education mostly from their own saving and part-time jobs. So, part-time jobs also a good reason to reduce every month paid for the students and gain some job experince. What are those reason? Every college students have to paid for the university and spent for their everyday life. There are so many kind of part-time jobs but, the most popular are Tutor, Barista, waiter, Bartender, Teaching assistant, Tour guide, Brand ambassdor, Photographer all these job give them some money that enough to paid for their own education. The second reason is college student can gain more job experince. It is good that most student get job experience while they are in university. When they granduate they can have a good jobs and they already have some jobs experience that can help them to reach the work goal more easy. Finally part-time jobs can improve college students skills and teach them how to earn the money, teach them how to success in the future and let them know the test of life. In conclusion part-time jobs give the college students so many benefits. Money and job experience are the key to reach the goal. study and work at the same time make the students try harder and less lazy. for me it is good to have a part-time jobs. Also me that work for a part-time jobs.
