 Nowadays, A lot of students in college already has worked or have part-time job. It has a lot of benefits, experiences, and other skills for their life after finish school or graduate. I completely agree with this opinion and think that having a part-time job is more important than not.
	First of all, I believe that a part-time job will make you feel grateful or prove to yourself that you can find money while studying in college and also get a lot of experience, In society, companies require people with experience, who can solve problems quickly, and who have soft skills and hard skills. The student has experience easily finding careers and has a lot of opportunities to work in those companies with high salaries. For example, the company always needs people with experience and understanding of the task, and it is easy to get trust from staff in the company, but when a worker with no experience comes to work it is really difficult to get trust from some staff and may not understand and can not work, which may lead to delays or late for the company. That's why it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
	Secondly, Students who work part-time jobs can earn some extra money. In other words, to earn money during studying college students should have to work first. For instance, having a part-time job help youth make money by themselves and also help the parents reduce the expenditure on the child. Thus, a part-time job is really significant for a youth's life.
	To conclude, I strongly recommend students at the university or college should have a part-time job before graduating because having experience is more important than having no experience in work and you can help reduce family expenses.
