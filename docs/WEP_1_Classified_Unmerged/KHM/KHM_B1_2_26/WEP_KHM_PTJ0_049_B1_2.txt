	Working while studying become popular for everyone in this century. As soon as working part-time also important for this generation. There are some discussion points, which show that college students should have a job or a part-time job. 
	First, part-time job can help us know how to manage our time. As we know how to make time for studying, relaxing and working, which are help us live busily with our day without thinking other unimportant staff that just waste our time. In age of college students, mostly they paying their time for sleeping, online shopping or even dating, which are such as a wasting time of their life and probably they get nothing from it. 
	Second, getting experience also priceless for our career in the future life. As all the jobs are required one or two year experiences, so it would be a high opportunity for the one who has experiences. All the experiences we all could get from our college or from different workplaces, where was our part-time job. Moreover, you would have chance in having a high salary by your experiences too. Many people work and get high salary base on their experiences as well. 
	Overall, from all the main points about, which were talking about their time management and their future career, we could see that how a part-time job helps college students a lots in their forward steps. So I am highly recommending to those freshmen to get a part-time job if they have chances.
