 
I always agree with college students to have part time job when we finished high school and continuous to study at university so, we need a lot of money to support our study. I think when we have part time job, we can help yourself and our family. We know that all students at university always spend a lot of money like they pay on school for Education, they pay for rent house, food for eat everyday and buy something else. Moreover, their family are poor that can not support their study enough, so they should have job by yourself to do for improve their studying. For example, if you don't have part time job and their family cannot support, they cannot continuous to study. We always saw people stop to study because without money. One more thing, we can find new experience of job. Actually, when we have part time job we can work and know everything from work like knowledge , how to be good worker and especially we know clearly about skill that we want to do in the future. Especially, we have money to protect when we sick or dangerous. We know that good health very important for yourself, so we should save some money to take care yourself. In the end, college students should have part time job are very important for support their study and anything else.  The last I hope students can find a part time job for help yourself and your family to do what we necessary everyday and we can get the most experience and successful in your life.
