   I gratly agree with college students to have a part time job while they are studying in the university to earn money to support their study. It is a great gateway for study and life experience because part time job. I think that it is useful for students to work part time. They can earn money and receive more experience for their future jobs. One of the major reasons for students to work part-time is earning money. Others may be to support their education, get some financial independence.
Students should have part time work to support their future career especially those whose part time job is connected with their major. When students work, they can practice what they learned in class. This not only helps them to remember the lesson more deeply, but also helps to know exactly what is important and needs to pay much attention. On the other hand, working part-time brings a lot of confidence in work, opportunities to learn about responsibility, cooperation. I patiently say approve that all the experience are the importin skills which are necessary for working.
Part time job is importin and helping us a lot for the students who are studying in the university. Example my friend Nik Nik, she does not have parents to support with her studying n. But part time can help her a lots it gives her responsibility to earn more money to support her studying. She works under the NGO.She is a teacher of English. Because of part time she can save money to pay for her university.    
In summary I believe that part-time job is really good for students. I advise college student to work part-time while we study. when we have an experience we have careful preparation and choose suitable jobs for our future career.
