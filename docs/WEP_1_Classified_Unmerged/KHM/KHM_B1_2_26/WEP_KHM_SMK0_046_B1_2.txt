Due to the increasing number of smokers abducting teens and the elderly in public places, there has been growing concern regarding the harmful effects of smoking on both smokers and non-smokers directly. Therefore, a complete ban on smoking in all restaurants across the country is necessary to protect the health and well-being of the general public.
	In fact, educating, encouraging a smoke-free society, banning smoking to people in restaurants and public places helps to create awareness of the dangers of smoking and encourages individuals to quit. Or reduce their smoking habits. In addition, it protects non-smokers, including children and pregnant women, who may be vulnerable to the harmful effects of secondhand smoke. Past experience has shown that a complete ban on smoking in a restaurant can be seen when a smoke-free restaurant becomes where it has lots of customer and the most crowded place. Non-smokers, in particular, will no longer be exposed to secondhand smoke and the health risks associated with indirect exposure to tobacco when they are enjoying their meal. It can attract more customers, including families and individuals who like a smoke-free and comfortable environment. However, the place that had smoke, we observe that there is a disturbance and less customers come to eat there.
	Finally, a complete ban on smoking in all restaurants is essential for the protection of public health and the promotion of a smoke-free society as in the past. By eliminating the risks associated with the smoke of cigarette, we can protect the well-being of the majority of our employees and non-smokers. Therefore, I totally agree that smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants in the country.
