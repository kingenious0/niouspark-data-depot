 Smoking should be completed banned at all the restaurants in the country. Do you agree or disagree?
      First of all i would like to say hello teacher and hello everyone I'm very excited to show you about   Smoking should be completed banned at all the restaurant in the country  
      Yes Smoking is not good for health and it can be very harmful when you smoke in a restaurant,it can affect those who are there it can cause illness to guest and staff if there y.having a child it is very harmful for his health,can be life threatening even if is does not affect life it is difficult to live can make us fear the burden in the family.
       Secondly , smoking cigarettes is extremely harmful to both the smoker and those around them. Quitting smoking can greatly reduce the risk of developing these serious health problems and improve overall health and well-being.
Finally for me smoking in a restaurant can be devastating for those in it too affecting work and family life when we smoke if for long time. In addition, it costs money a lot on smoking cigarettes and especially waste money and it is also harmful to their lungs.  More importantly, it will be effected to the people who live their by either.
