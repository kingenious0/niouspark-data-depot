For my opinion smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country for some reason. There are 13.04% of smokers in Cambodia by 2021. Smoking are harmed for people health it can cause many trouble thing that can kill the people from a bit to a bits. Restaurant is a place where people eat and drink, so smoking can affect to other customers. So what are the reason that smoking should be banned in the restaurants? The first of all we have to know how smoking can harmed to your health and how many trouble illness that can cause to your boby. Lung cancer is the first thing to mention. All the cigarette have alot of chemical affected it stronge enough to destroy your lungs. When you smoke in a restaurant the smoke would be fly all around the coners of the restaurant. So, many peolpe would have collected all the same into their lung. After that it would cause health problem also it very disrespect to other customer who there to eat their food, After they smelled the smoke it ruined their feeling and the food it might not be delicious anymore. The seconds reason is about the kids. Kids are weaker that adult ,so if they collected the smoked in their lung it harmed their lung more faster that adult. One more thing it not good to show the kids about smoking it not a good maners because they would want to test it how it test. finally smoking in a restaurant is harmed to all people. It have no benefit it only destroyed our lung and many health problems and it is a bad acting for the kids. In conclusion smoking in a restaurants should be banned it cause alot of trouble to many people especailly the small kids and it work really fast in kids lungs. For my opinion smoking should be banned for real and i agree with that.
