 I do agree with the topic that  It is important for college students to have a part-time job . It is a bit difficult for them, that they have to work and have to study. But it is necessary for them to have it. Because nowadays, wherever also need employee who has experience in job at least two or three years. So, if they have a part job during studying, they will have good opportunity for job in the future. Beside of that, they will gain experience, get financial support, build communication, improve confidence and improve skill.
In fact, nowadays most of the students even in high school or in college are having a part time job. Because they need a job for support their living and studying. One more thing, if they have a place for work when they studying, it can gain their experience that university or college don't teach them. Furthermore, if they have experience during studying, they also can find a new job or a good position when they finish their college. Beside of that, they can get financial during studying, they can provide what they want. They can afford their family too. One more thing, they can build communication with each other.
