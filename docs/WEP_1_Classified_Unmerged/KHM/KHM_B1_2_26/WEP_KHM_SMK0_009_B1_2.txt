I agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants. Smoking in a restaurant, especially when it is in a dining area with a lot of people, exposes customers and restaurant employees to cigarette smoke. First of all, cigarette smoke has a smelly and unpleasant scent which sticks to people's hair, clothes, furniture and even the food people eat. It is important for restaurants to maintain cleanliness in their kitchen and dining area, and this also includes the air and atmosphere. In addition, non-smokers are not used to getting exposed to the smell of cigarettes. The smell of the smoke affects all people and can turn them off their food. People pay to taste good food in restaurants but irresponsible smokers may make them unhappy and lose their appetites when they eat. Furthermore, they should avoid it at all costs because they risk getting secondhand smoke, which leads to higher risks of harmful health effects including serious diseases like diabetes lung cancer and heart disease. Not to mention, some people are more sensitive or allergic to smoke compared to other people. Cigarette smoke may enter others' systems by them consuming smoke-contaminated food and inhaling polluted air, potentially putting people at fatal risk. In conclusion, I agree that smoking should not be allowed in restaurants and people should obey the rules in order to not disrupt others' dining experience and keep them safe from secondhand smoke.
