Because part-time work is the best way for them to easily fund or support their studies. I think they should have a part-time job that is best for them. All university students should have part-time work, because we know that for university students or college students, they have to spend a lot on school and travel, gas and school supplies. That is, renting a house for students who live far away. For example, students in the provinces or remote areas, they are looking for accommodation, renting a house and other necessities such as food, expenses, study materials, clothing and money to help the family. The best way to help any student in the study. We know that part-time work can help a lot. From their work, they can easily pay for their school fees and other materials. They have work experience and look for new jobs in addition to their work to find success and future in life, and they can arrange the time for study to be a bridge to success and a good future for them.
