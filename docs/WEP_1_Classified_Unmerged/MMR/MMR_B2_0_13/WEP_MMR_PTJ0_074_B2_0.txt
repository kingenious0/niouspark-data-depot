 I agree with the topic because of the following reasons. Most of college students have part time job.The main reason for having a part time job is to make some money. College students have to pay for school, for books and etc. So they need an extra money. It isn't so important for college students to have a part time job. Students who have a part time job is more independent than others. They can study full-time and work for part time. 
They can communicate with others and they can fill their mind and brain with knowledge. Having a part time job will help to gain social skills.It may help to find your dream job. Working a part time job will give you new colleagues and opportunities. Having a part time job can develop useful skills and make your mind mature. 
It will make you fresh and you may get some new ideas for your school project,asaigments and more experiences.If you work, you will understand about job and career. By the way, the main fact is to study full-time. lf you have a part time job but you don't study hardly, you will fail the exam. Part time job is important but school activities,projects and assignment are more important. However, student life can't get twice. Therefore you must spend your college student life balancing and act.
