I do not agree with this statement because there are different people in this world so maybe some of them like smoking but for the left, they will not. Because of this fact, we cannot make this decision. For every situation, they should allow people to smoke. Especially most of the people who come to bars and clubs normally smoke. Unless they can smoke at that place, their peaceful happiness is silently destroyed. It is not fair for them. So we can make a smoking area at somewhere in the restaurant. In this case, if they want to smoke, they can go and smoke there and for those who do not like smoking, they can avoid that particular area I think it is fair for both sides like people who like smoking and people who avoid smoking and especially for those who cannot stand the smoke, for example, those people who have asthma or so. These make this problem easily solved and no complaints will be there anymore related to this issue. Besides, it will also increase the network because the people who have same passion or personality, can make friends easily and this will bring them pure happiness without disturbing anyone. Therefore, I strongly disagree with this statement.
