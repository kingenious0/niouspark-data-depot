I disagree with this topic.There is a saying Hundred People Thousand Minds .There are billions of people in this planet earth.Some may prefer to smoke, but some won't.Instead of banning smoking at all restaurants in the country, you should divide the kinds of restaurants.In restaurants you wish to prohibit smoking, you can write no smoking restaurant, smoke-free zone or something else.But in restaurants you wish to allow, you can show signs that you allow.For example, people smoke in tea shops while talking with their friends.This is the vibe they wish to feel.But if you prohibit smoking in tea shop , these kinds of people won't come anymore.In European countries, people sit in cafes just to smoke.If the government of that country, approved a law to completely banned smoking at all restaurants in the country they would even start a protest.Dividing kinds would only work.If you wish to smoke while sitting in a restaurant, you can go to a restaurant which allows.If you hate smoking, you can eat in a restaurant which prohibits.This would only be the way which works.Therefore, smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
