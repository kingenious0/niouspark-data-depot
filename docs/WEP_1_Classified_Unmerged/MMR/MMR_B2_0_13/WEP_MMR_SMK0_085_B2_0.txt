It has become common knowledge that a lit cigarette harms the health of not only the smoker but all those who have to inhale its smoke. The secondhand smoke itself induces coughs, gets into our eyes and gives off an unappetizing smell. Therefore, it is no wonder that restaurants would want to ban smoking altogether. While this is understandable, I disagree with this position and believe that there are more effective measures than a total ban across all restaurants. First of all, smoking in the restaurants may inconvenience non-smoking customers, but a smoking ban would inconvenience smokers, who are also paying customers. it is in the restaurants' interests to not place a total ban but to reach a compromise. So, instead of a complete ban, we should consider accommodating smokers by providing designated smoking areas separate from but joined to the dining areas. Secondly, smokers should be able to smoke without having to leave the restaurant. Smokers very often have nicotine addiction, which is difficult to overcome. Disincentivizing addicts by inconveniencing them has not been shown to make them give it up. It is within a smoker's right not have the added shame of having to leave their friends and family in a restaurant while the smoker to satiates his need. Thirdly, smoke breaks provide much-needed relief for stressed food service workers. While workplace bans can reduce smoking, if the employers don't provide an alternative to smoking but take away the only non-mandatory break workers have, then workplace dissatisfaction will increase. Which is why, restaurants should not ban smoking completely but allow designated spaces for customers and employees to smoke. While it seems selfish that smokers damage others' health for their own pleasure, we can prevent the damage by providing smoking areas, making restaurants a welcoming space for everyone.
