Cigarette smoke delivers more than forty known cancer-causing chemicals.There is no compelling evidence that regular exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke threatens the health of those who don't smoke. Our bodies are exposed to chemicals that cause cancer,coronary heart disease,stroke and respiratory conditions such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Cigarette smoking is very harmful. It is harmful for both smoker and non-smoker.People who smoke in public places just show how inconsiderate they are towards others.So, everyone should not try to smoke and smokers should cut down smoking for the good of their health as well as for the others.
