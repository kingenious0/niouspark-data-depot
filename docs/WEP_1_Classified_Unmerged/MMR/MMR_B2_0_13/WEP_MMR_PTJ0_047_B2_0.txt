 I disagree with this topic.For a student, the most and only important job is studying.Every student should only focus on their lessons. Doing multiple works will just make them stressful and exhausted.For example, imagine going to work why you are struggling with your tutorials,presentations and assignments.In my opinion, except for students who have financial problems it is not important for college students to have a part-time job.You may earn quite a few amount of money, but it is not worth it.By doing part-time job together with studying, it may effect your grades.
Some may say, to have job experience you should get a part time job, but in real that point of view is wrong.
During the period of studying, job experience is not important.In life, the process of studying is the shortest.You must work for the rest of your life.You will get job experience more than enough. Working while studying is like overcoming the steps.Some people would say you will get many advantages by doing part-time job.
But compare with the disadvantages, it is nothing.Every student should have the right to learn happily and freely without any anxiety and stress.This is the most important thing for students.So in conclusion, it is not important for college students to have a part-time job.
