           Since early time, smoking has been around and popular among both men and women. Some do it for the sake of pleasure, some for soothing themselves, and some smoke for they are addicted to it. It's been an interesting and controversial topic if the restaurant should completely ban smoking. In my opinion, it should not be completely banned. I will be discussing why I think this way in this essay.
          First of all, there is a universal fact that one have rights to do one likes as long as it is not disturbing others both physically and mentally. When it comes to smoking, there are those who like them or even love them, those who don't mind, and those who can't stand at all. Some are even addicted to it since nicotine is addictive. If we think about it, there are also people who don't mind inhaling the smoke from other people smoking and those who do mind a lot. When deciding something, we have to look both sides and try to be fair and justice. Therefore, I think restaurants should consider having a specified place or corner for those who like smoking and don't mind the smoke , and a place for non-smokers and those who don't like the smoke.
        To conclude, since I believe the statement that people have their rights to do what they like as long as it is not disturbing, I disagree with the topic  Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country .
