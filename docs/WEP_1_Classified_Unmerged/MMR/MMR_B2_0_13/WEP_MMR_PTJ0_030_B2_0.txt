 As a human, there are variety of survival processes throughout the entire life and education is one of them. But higher education needs financial investment to an extent which makes some people difficult to attend college or university. Therefore, working part-time as a student becomes one of the best options. 
To begin with, a lot of developed countries such as UK, United States has different opportunities for students although developing countries like Myanmar has little to no choice in various aspects especially for jobs and education. A handful of upper-classed people with a strong family background usually tend to choose high raking popular private schools which costs thousands of dollars. Nowadays, even the public government colleges, the cost is getting much higher and ordinary families with basic income are struggling for their children' education. Therefore, they have to continue their journey of education while working on their free time. 
Furthermore, working part-time has variety of benefits including supporting the family's living cost, earning education and work experiences at the same time, developing hard and soft skills through the related job, and so on. However, countries that are still trying to be developed have difficulties in offering part-time jobs for students. In Myanmar, citizens find it difficult to get a full-time job and employers do not want an employee without any education degree in which case students still trying to get a degree becomes almost impossible to get a job. In such country, people cannot find a part-time job if they are studying in a college or a university. 
To sum up, giving the opportunity to work part-time for college or university students are essential to improve the quality of life. The authority in developing countries also needs to focus on this topic which can lead to country's overall success.
