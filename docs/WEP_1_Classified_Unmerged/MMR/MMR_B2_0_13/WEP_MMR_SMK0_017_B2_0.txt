 Everything has its own ups and downs, and goods and bads including smoking. Of course, there are many negative effects of smoking which is widely aware of by many people but completely banning smoking at all the restaurants in the country is not the best and most effective solution in my humble opinion. 
It is true that smoking is bad not only for our health but also for the people around us but each and everyone has their right to make their own choices whether to smoke or not. It is important to reduce health issues effected by smoking and secondhand smoking but banning countrywide may not be the best cure to this. Instead of banning, having separate places for smokers and non-smokers at restaurants might be better in my point of view. By doing this, there could be a significant progress in reducing secondhand smoking diseases. If smoking is prohibited in all the restaurants, there could be a huge effect on food and beverage business circle. Some restaurants focusing on smokers and drinkers may have to face financial problems and hardships to continue doing business if there is a complete ban. 
To conclude, I don't support the idea of completely banning smoking at all the restaurants. I think it would be better just to prohibit smoking at public areas and causing harmfulness to the secondhand smokers.
