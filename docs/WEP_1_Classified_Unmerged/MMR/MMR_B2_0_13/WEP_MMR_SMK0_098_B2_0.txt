"   ""Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.""
                  The topic of whether smoking should be banned from all places. There are people who enjoy smoking and other people who oppose it. Nowadays, there are many ways to smoke such as cigarettes or vape. Should smoking be banned completely at all the restaurants in the country? In this essay, I will be discussing this controversy issue with a few comparisons. 
             First of all, it has been proved that smoking is harmful to the primary consumer and to the people who breathe in that smoke, known as secondhand smoking. It is quite unfair to give harm to other people who did nothing at all. Thus, looking from this perspective, smoking should be banned to protect the majority.
             Secondly, many people give in to smoking as it makes them calm and relaxed. Some people wash away their stress and sadness away with smoking. If we think of this way, then banning smoking would also be quite unfair for the minority of people who use smoking as a place to escape from the cruelty of the world. 
           To compare and give a fair opinion, people have the right to refuse breathing in the harmful gas they did not ask for and for the smokers, they should as well have a place to enjoy their activity. That's why, I strongly agree with the point that ""smoking should be completely banned"" and disagree with the point ""at all restaurants in the country"". Smoking should be banned from public areas and most parts of restaurants, however, I believe that restaurants should provide a private place to allow smoking, for instance a rooftop would make a great place for smoking. In this way, smoking could be done without disturbing and harming other people.
