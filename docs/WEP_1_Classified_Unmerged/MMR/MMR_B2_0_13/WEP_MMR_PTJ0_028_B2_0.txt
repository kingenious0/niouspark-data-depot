 Youths these days,  especially college students who we assume are mature and grown enough to live independently or to live on their own, tend to earn their own income for different sorts of expenses. In doing so, part-time jobs are most sought after. While it is not essential to do part-time jobs for some college students, it does play a vital role in becoming who they are for those who do part-time jobs.
          In my country, part-time jobs are not that popular and are hard to find, the reason being overprotective parents of Myanmar youths making them lack in confidence. The parents always take everything into their hands which their children could have done easily by themselves. Later, it results in making  their children think that they cannot do things by themselves and later they will become afraid to step out of their comfort zone.
         When deciding you should do part-time or not, family background is of importance as well. If the family is capable of providing  financially, then the student would not feel the need to seek part-time jobs. If not, he or she will have to. There is nothing comparable to the feeling of spending you own hard-earned money. What's more is that he or she will learn the value of money, how the society really works in life, the ups and downs, and everything that will help you understand more about life and make you more mature.
          In conclusion, while it is beneficial  for the college students to do part-time jobs, it isn't essential to do so. It is up to his or her decision.
