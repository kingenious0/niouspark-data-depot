 When it comes to having a part-time job as a college student, we all have different perspectives. Some people claim that it is not a good idea as it has many drawbacks. Personally, I think doing a part-time job while attending university is effective for us.
Firstly, they can gain valuable skills by doing a job at such a young age. They will be well prepared for the difficulties that they may face in their careers. Moreover, they will achieve work experience and it will boost their employment rate too. As they are interacting with various levels of people like customers or managers, their communication skills will be developed.
On the other hand, some people think that it can harm their studies and educational achievement like degrees and grades. This is because they think that time is wasted while doing such jobs. Some also point out that these jobs are temporary so students should focus on their studies more which can guarantee their future jobs.
To sum up, I think both of them are correct. However, as a university student who is also doing a part-time job myself, I think it is a good idea to do such jobs as it can give us precious experiences and make us mature.
