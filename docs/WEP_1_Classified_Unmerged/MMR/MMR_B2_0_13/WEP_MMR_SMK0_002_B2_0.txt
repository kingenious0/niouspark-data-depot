 Smoking is a bad habit and it can ruin not only your health but also those wh, banningo live near you too. Because of that fact, some said that it should be banned in restaurants. However I think banning it is not a good option as we have human rights. We can find many other good solutions instead of banning them.
On the one hand, I accept the fact that most people want to regard public places like restaurants as smoking-free zone as they can't resist smoke. In addition, it can also give them the possibility of lungs related diseases as they become passive smokers. It is like not having respect for your surroundings and is kind of rude in our countries too. If an adult is smoking in the restaurant and a teenager sees him, he will probably want to try this as he thinks it is stylish. So it is really important to keep our manners too.
On the other hand, as we are living in the twenty-first century, we have our own right to smoke too. So, we should make a smoking zone in each restaurant. By doing this, we can simply solve this problem without colonizing anyone's rights. Lastly, we should also educate people to smoke in special zones when they are in public places like restaurants as this can disturb other people unintentionally.
