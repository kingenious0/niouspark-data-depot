 In these days, the percentage of smoking people have raised as like a skyrocket.  There is also a confliction that restaurants should not allow smoke or they should. However, since it is not denied that smoking can cause loads of side effects to the environment, I strongly agree with this statement.

In my view, smoking in the public area like restaurants is a disturbance. In other words, if one is smoking in the hall of restaurants, their smoke will slightly move in the air and other people who does not even know how to smoke will breathe them.  They become passive smokers then it can lead to several diseases which is related to lungs.  For example, the description of Time News Magazine in 2020 shows 82% of the passive smokers had suffered from lungs cancer or other related diseases.  Hence, completely banning smoking at the restaurants brings several benefits for pubic.

The next point is the restaurants could get green environment and reduce the air pollution around that area.  In fact, since there is no one who smoke near the area of restaurant, people could get clean air and it will green the environment.  If I have to figure it out, the more completely banning smoking areas spread, the better results to protect air pollution come out.  That's why the area that completely banned smoking should set up especially at the restaurants.

If I have to sum up, I strongly believe that as smoking can lead many damages of public health and environment, it is more appropriate to completely ban at all restaurants in the country.
