 I agree with the topic because of the following reasons.People who smoke are increasing day by day. Smoking is totally dangerous but they choose to smoke. Smoking can cause cancer, heart and lungs illness. Everyone knows that smoking affects people's health. Smoking in public places is already banned. Smoking in the room which consists of aircon doesn't allow.People who smoke in the public places are very rude especially at the restaurant. They imitate dangerous smoke that can cause cancer to the people who breathe it. Restaurant is a place where we meet our friends, lover, family and spend our time eating with peacefully.Restaurants let people smoke while they are having a meal.If someone light a cigarette, the smoke separates all over the place. All people in the restaurant become second hand smokers. 
They don't smoke but they breathe. It is just a little smoke but it contains many diseases. If there is children, it will be more affective to them.However, those smokers can smoke at their home without affecting the others. It is so annoying and disturbing. If smoking is banned in all restaurants and cafe,it may improve our health. Health is the most important thing in our life. If you are a smoker, please avoid smoking in the public areas especially at the restaurant.
