 In modern society, drinking alcohol and smoking becomes a normal activity particularly amongst young adults. However, I agree with the idea of completely banning smoking at all the restaurants in the country. 
First and foremost, cigarettes as well as cigars contain extremely high amounts of harmful chemicals such as nicotine, carbon monoxide, etc. The impact of these hundreds of chemicals is unimaginably detrimental to humans' health. Most people realize the disadvantages of smoking due to the fact that they have been educated for several years by campaigns, advertisements, and other social movements. It causes a lot of people to replace smoking with vaping although they do not understand that vaping has no difference compared to standard smoking. E-cigarettes contain all the same harmful chemicals except a slight difference in nicotine concentration. Because of the variety of rich flavors which are added to e-cigarettes, people are getting addicted to these things.
On the other hand, smoking does not only affect smokers' health but also causes the exact same side effects to surrounding people who inhale the released smoke. During recent years, studies show that the rate of non-smoking lung cancers has increased by 40%. Therefore, restaurants should have smoking areas to reduce the unwanted negative impact for the environment. 
To be concluded, although we cannot control people to stop smoking, the government should take legal actions on smoking within the restaurants. If people want to smoke or vape, they must go outside of the restaurant or to the places that are regarded as smoking sections.
