I totally agree with the statement,  It is important for college students to have a part-time job . As I am a university student, I am over 20 years old and I do not want to depend on others. I want to have my own income using my skills, which can be mentally or physically. This makes the students see the real world problems and they need to adapt in these situations as fast as they can. Unless, it will not be easy to survive in their life. The students are young, enthusiastic and active. They can do whatever they want during these moments. Thus, they should not waste their youth in useless things such as playing games a lot, haging out all the time and so on. These can lead them to become drug dealer or something else which is definitely not good for their life. So they should work in their free time and learning what the real world looks like. Besides, when they finish their graduation, they will have not only degree but also work experience. This will make them bold when they apply their dream jobs. By doing part-time, they will achieve their goals more quickly than those who were only studying at university. And it has loads of advantages including fiancial issues, social activities, networking and etc. That is why I completely agree with this statement.
