Smokers said, 'Smoking is a way of letting go the stress'. They can give different reasons why they smoke. It doesn't make sense for a non-smoker how the reasons of smokers may differ. It's still fine that their smoke doesn't disturb others. But, the restaurants are the public areas. When someone smokes near us, we have to inhale the tobacco smoke spreading in the air. That's called passive smoking. If someone smokes at the restaurant, the environment near him will be inappropriate to inhale. That's why smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. First of all, smoking can harm the smoker's respiratory system. The time that he smokes last longer, his health will get worse. Otherwise, the smoke exposure can cause diseases his family or the person near the smoker. Secondly, the tobacco smoke is really annoying. For those who have asthma, the smoke can be the main fact that gives allergies to them. Everyone's first priority is being healthy. Isn't is? So we should take care of our health at all costs. We can't happily die because of the exposure to the smoke as a second-hand smoker. That's why Smoking Free Policies are appeared. And most of the countries banned smoking in public areas. In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned in public areas. Even though we can't ban smoking in those areas, smokers should smoke near an open window, fireplace dust or on his private property. We should not harm our environment because of us.
