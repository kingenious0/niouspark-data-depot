"              It is known around the world that more and more college students are doing part time jobs or taking a gap year before college. It provides an important role to the students in teaching them with necessary life skills, experience and of course money. In this essay, I will be discussing about college students doing part-time jobs.
         First of all, a student can gain experience from the job. Most fresh-out-of-highschool students know nothing about how the world works so this is a great option for them to learn soft skills such as communication skills, problem-solving skills and decision-making skills. 
          Secondly, extra money will help student cover some expenses. Tuition fees are not significantly expensive in many countries but can be costly in countries such as US, Canada or UK, especially for international students. Having a part time job can somewhat reduce the burden of having to pay for Tuition fees.
             On the contrary, doing a part time job while having to focus on studies can be a problem for students. For instance, many students having part time jobs face both lesson pressure and work pressure. They must be punctual to both work and school and plus, they must always be active during the work time.
               Furthermore, this can add stress to students and may cause depression. Basically, the time for a part time job is taken by the leisure time of a student. Thus, students will feel that they are missing out on things that they should be doing.
           In conclusion, having a part time job can be both good and bad. While the students could get life experiences and help with expenses, they will face with great pressure and lack of self-care. In my opinion, a part time job is beneficial to students if they can keep work-life balance."
