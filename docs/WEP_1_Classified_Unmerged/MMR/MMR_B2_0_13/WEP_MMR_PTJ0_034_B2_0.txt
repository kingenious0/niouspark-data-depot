 As the college students have their own dreams to create them, they do have tons of expectations from university.  It is often argued that part-time job plays an important role in the University students' life.  However, I completely disagree with this statement and supposed to say that the academic qualification is the thing that all of the college students hope for.

First of all, I believed that three quarters of the college students come to the College to learn academic lessons for their carrier.  The University is the one which could give the academic knowledge but also the practical training for respective fields so it is clear that college students choose the university student life.  If I have to show you, youths who are interested in vocational training would go internship trainings as soon as they completed the Highschool educational level.  That's why I would like to say that the college students more expect qualified educational system than the opportunities of having part-time job.

The next thing I want to point out is that student having a part-time job will not be competent since they gradually leak their attention and potential in learning journey.  In fact, the College is one and only place for them to learn systematically loads of skills which they must possess in their professions.  As an example, according to the research of Harvard University in 2019, 73% of the students who invest some of their time in part-time jobs do not own the high grades and they lost some competence in their professional lives.  Hence, I think that having a part-time job is not a priority thing in the life of college student.

In conclusion, I strongly believed that having a part-time job is not as important as having the qualified academic knowledge.
