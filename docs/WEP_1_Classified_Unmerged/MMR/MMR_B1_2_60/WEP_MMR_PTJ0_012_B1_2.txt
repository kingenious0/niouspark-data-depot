 College students need to have a part-time job. We need to have work experiences when we find the job. By working part-time jobs, we can get work experiences. Besides, we can improve social skill because we deal with colleagues, customers, clients and so on. So, we can get many friends. The cost of a college student is expensive.  We can find the fee for college ourselves if we have a part-time job. So, it is helping our parents. Moreover, we can get better financial management skill as we make money ourselves and we know how tired to make money and the value of money. Another advantage of part-time job is that we can improve time management skill. Because we have to balance study time and work time. There are many part-time jobs in other countries such as Korea, Japan, America. On the other hand, there is no many part-time jobs in our country, Myanmar. The only part-time job in our country is teaching the languages that you are proficient. The demand for learning other languages such as korean, japanese in recent years. I want part-time jobs to be increased in other fields in Myanmar. Working part-time job while we are a college student can make me exhausted. But we can get a lot of advantages for our future.
