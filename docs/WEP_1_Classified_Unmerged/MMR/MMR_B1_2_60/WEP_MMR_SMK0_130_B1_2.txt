"All we know that smoking is a harmful activity. However, on the other hand, it is a stress reliever. It is said that people smoke when they need pleasure. I accept that smoking is a bad thing to find pleasure but I would like to disagree the above statement. I will explain my ideas.

First of all, we can't force the smokers not to smoke in this place or in that place because of human rights. It is impossible to ban smoking completely at all the restaurants in the country. Most of the customers in restaurants are men and most of the smokers are also be said men. So it is not possible to ban smoking in all of the restaurants. The impression and the sale rate may get low if all the restaurants promote non-smoking in their restaurants. There should also be restaurants where customers can smoke like restaurants including smoking area or room. To the next fact, the reason why customers come to the restaurants is because they want to relieve stress, to be happy and to be free. In my opinion, I think the staff of the restaurants should give the best service to them. They should let them to do whatever they like. If smoking disturb the other customers in the restaurants, I suggest that the owners of the restaurants should crate some smoking rooms, smoking areas, and smoking space.

Most of the people smoke these days. Therefore, in my opinion, smoking can't be banned in all of the restaurants to improve their business. I think in this generation, the restaurants that banned smoking can be boycotted. So as a youth in this generation, I disagree the statement, " smoking should banned completely at all of the restaurants in the country."
