 
Personally, I am not agree with that. As we all know that, the college students' struggle for the whole day is almost doing a work and is also so tired. If he or she have a part-time job, we may be not fully focus on the lecture or may be get tired and then sick. Running a work or working under a employer is not easy practically. He or she may be stressful whenever he or she fail a task or is repremaned by the employer or not get on well with other colleagues. If he or she get a degree, he or she have a opportunality to get a well-paid job. If he or she fails the exam just because of having focus on part-time job, he may keep dissapointed with the matter and forgo it. My neighbour typify that matter. He was an outstanding student and achieved no.1 in every class and educational competition. However, in his college time, his familywas in a tight tip and so he was determined to have a part-time job. It was not so evident in the first year, which is commonly least learning period. But, subsequently, he found it difficult to balance the things he hold on. Finally, he left the college and run his family not very well and difficultly.
