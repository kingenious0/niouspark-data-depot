 The national treasure of a country is certainly  The Students . Among them, the most mature and the most important lineage is college students. Because college students have chosen the major they interested in and they are now learning and being taught not only about the materials and knowledge for their career but also about how the society and communication work so that they can fit in the community and have enjoyable life with better job opportunities.
I strongly agree with the fact that it is important to have part-time jobs for college students. Firstly, the process of learning is not fulfilled with just the will to learn. It also requires money to study whether in one's own land or going abroad. Students from countries that do not have the part-time job system are obligated to depend on their parents for the school or university fees. This limits their social experience and potentials. Secondly, experience and life lessons can only be found when the students have interaction with people in daily life, in reality. They will come to know how to handle the situations, deals with annoying customers, doing statistic and form a healthy community with coworkers. Thirdly, they will recognize the important of self-discipline and management of time and finance. 
The differences between the two students, the one who has been exposed to the outside world and the child who is satisfied with the amount of pocket money he has in his hands, is infinite. In accord with all the things that I have mentioned above, I insist that the sole fundamental reason why graduated university students could not even find a decent job and live a stable life in some countries is because they do not have the system of part-time job for youngsters like college students.
