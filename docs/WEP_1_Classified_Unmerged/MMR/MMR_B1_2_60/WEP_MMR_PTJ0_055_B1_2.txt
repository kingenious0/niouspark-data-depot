      I agree with the statement that college students should have a part-time job. College students are around and over 20 years old which can be regarded as the age to be able to stand on oneself.
     First of all, having a part-time job is very fruitful in a way that we can develop skills and also gain new experience. This includes social and communicative skills, life skills and also help to manage time properly. It can also enhance teamwork and management skills. Not only this, it can also open up future careers and potential work opportunities. There is no doubt that students who have a part-time job is always superior than that of normal students either in society or college. Secondly, a college student's expanse is a lot more than that of an elementary or high school student. So, having a part-time job and being able to earn on oneself make one financial independent and reduce burden for the family. Since we can make extra pocket money, we can either save it or spend on whatever we like. Moreover, when we can earn on our own, we will become more confident ad self-content. 
     In short, there may be different views on doing a part-time job. But, personally  I always admire and appreciate peers who work and earn themsleves. However, a reminder is that we should be careful when finding a part-time jobs as scammers are everywhere and we should be aware not to fall into their hands.
