 I agree with this statement. Smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country as it is a bad habit. 

A restaurant is a venue where people can eat in public. Restaurants attract a diverse range of consumers, including the elderly, young children, and those who are ill. Therefore, a restaurant must maintain a clean and safe environment. Smoking in public places is extremely upsetting and irritating. Smokers are permitted to do so at home and other locations without disturbing others. Smoking is acceptable at bars and clubs. However, many families with both young and old adults ate in restaurants. 
Many of the consumers at certain restaurants do smoke. They are not the sole consumers, though, and non-smokers can still be profitable for these businesses. All restaurants would not suffer much from a smoking ban. Everyone is aware that smoking does cause more damage than good. Smoke from a cigarette inhaled by a smoker can cause respiratory issues and lung cancer in those who don't even smoke at all. If someone doesn't care about their health, we can't forbid them from smoking. However, we can restrict smoking in some places, like restaurants, to protect people from serious health risks. Additionally, if other customers don't enjoy the smoke, there's no reason for them to inhale it. 
In conclusion, the majority of people who visit restaurants are not smokers. The health of people will be improved by the smoking ban. Therefore, smoking should be prohibited in restaurants.
