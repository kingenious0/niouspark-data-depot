 Yes, I absolutely agree about this discussion.
Nowadays, a lot of people especially teenagers pick up this as a habit just because of their stress in work, personal issues or problems and something more. Moreover, some are taking a cigarette even in public areas. When someone smoke a cigarette, they do not only hurt themselves but also everyone around them including children. 
It increases the risk of getting infection on the human body especially the lungs. It can also affect breathing and causes coughing. Moreover, it also reduces the ability to perform physical and mental exercises. 
Most importantly, it is an expensive habit. In other words, it can heavily cost in your finance. Even though some people don't have money , they waste it on cigarettes just because of their addiction.
However, there is no doubt that smoking can reduce the quality of your life if you are one of the smokers.
If we abstract the topic of this discussion, it is about a personal freedom verses public health issues. As we all know that there are many disadvantages of smoking , it should be completely banned at everywhere in the country to make a happy and healthy environment for the next generations of our mother world.
