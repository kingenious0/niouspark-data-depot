 As a university student, I do agree with the statement,  it is important for college students to have a part-time job.  Personally, I think that college students are the most suitable to have a part-time job because we are at the age of being willing to learn something enthusiastically and to earn money with our own effort. Thus, I think doing a part-time job is some kind of investing for our future. 
First of all, doing a part-time job can give us a lot of knowledge and experiences since we can get an opportunity to do things in a practical way. Secondly, we can improve our communication skills since we enter a new society and meet with new people. In a new society with new people, we can also learn some lessons by encountering the things we have never experienced before. From these lessons and experiences, our attitude and thoughts can become much more mature. Moreover, we can feel pleasure from earning money which are based on our own effort. Even if the money we earn is not much, that pleasure is so precious that nothing can replace. If the money we earn is quite a lot, it can give us an opportunity to become financially independent, without relying on our family anymore. Especially for students who have financial problems, it is very important to earn money for their tuition fees and personal expenses by doing a part-time job. Last but not least, work history from a part-time job can help us to include as an experience in our resume for future job.
For above reasons, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. But one thing to be aware is that we should keep a balance between our academic studies and a part-time job.
