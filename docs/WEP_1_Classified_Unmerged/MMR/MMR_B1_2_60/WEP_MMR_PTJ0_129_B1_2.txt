"Most people think it is controversial to say part-time jobs aren't affecting the study time of students. However, I think they have more advantages over disadvantages for collage students.

Firstly, students can earn side income from their part-time jobs. This will  be useful not only for their current education and their future plans. They don't need to ask money from their parents to buy something they want  Secondly, having a part-time job can offer work experience which will be very useful in filling CV form. Moreover, they can have a chance to preview how an actual work place looks like. Thirdly,  it may improve their communicative skills since most jobs nowadays are team work .By doing part-time jobs, students can sharpen their necessary skills.

On the other hand, some people think that part-time jobs can have negative impact on their studies and grades. It is not easy to handle both studies and jobs well because of tiredness and stress from part-time jobs. So, they think students should only focus on studying in their student life.

In conclusion,  I think if the students can handle both work and studies well, part-time jobs can surely help their future career in some ways."
