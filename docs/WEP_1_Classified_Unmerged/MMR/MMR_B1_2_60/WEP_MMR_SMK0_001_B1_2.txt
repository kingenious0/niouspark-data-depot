 I definitely agree with the statement,  smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.  We all know that smoking affects our health very badly. But sadly, although all of the smokers aware of it, they do not try to quit smoking since they are addicted to that taste. Then I suggest that even if they cannot quit smoking, they should avoid giving disturbance or trouble to others who do not smoke.
Restaurants are regarded as public places where many people go and out. There may be both who smoke and who do not smoke. From my knowledge, the smoke coming from smoking affects not only the ones who smoke but also for the people in the surrounding area who feel the smoke through inhalation. It can lead people to diagnosed with lung diseases and other respiratory disorders. Besides, it feels really annoying for the non-smokers to feel the smoke in public places, especially in the restaurant where we have our food. For example, for me as a non-smoker who really hate smoking, it is really annoying to feel the smoke when I have my lunch at the university canteen. Moreover, in a restaurant, there might be some people with asthma, who have some difficulties in breathing. In that case, it is risky to have someone who smoke in the restaurant.
Thus, restaurants should completely ban smoking since it is the place where offer food and drinks to customers. Providing an outside place as a smoking area will be the best idea for both the customers who smoke and who do not smoke, as the smokers can smoke freely as they wish outside the restaurant and the non-smokers will not feel any disturbance from the smoke inside the restaurant.
