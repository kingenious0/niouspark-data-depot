"I really agree with the title mentioned above . Banning smoking in all restaurants is important because it can harm people's health. When someone smokes, the smoke can also hurt pregnant women and kids, causing things like lung cancer and breathing problems. It's not just the person smoking who gets affected, but also others who breathe in that yucky smoke.

Smoking doesn't only mess with our breathing.It also makes the air dirty. The stuff in cigarette smoke can go into the air and make it not good for us. This is not only bad for people's health but also for the air we all share. That's why it's really important to stop smoking in places like restaurants.

When we make a rule to stop smoking in restaurants, we're doing something big to keep everyone healthy. Especially pregnant women and kids.they can stay safer when they don't have to breathe in smoke. Plus, saying no to smoking in public places helps keep the air cleaner, making everyone in the community healthier.

So, in the end, saying no to smoking in restaurants is all about caring for everyone's health. It is thinking about how smoking affects others and our air. Making this rule helps everyone, especially those who need it the most, and makes sure we have cleaner, healthier places for everyone to enjoy.
