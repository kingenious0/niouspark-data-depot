 
     I strongly agree that smoking should be entirely prohibited in all restaurants. This is mainly because of health, social and environmental factors.
     One of the very first reasons is that as we all know smoking not only affects the smoker but also to the ones around him who inhale the smoke. Therefore, it is very unhealthy for both the body and the environment, mainly because the sidestream smoke is more hazardous than mainstream smoke. When we eat food, we are basically happy, and we want to enjoy meal. At that time, when we smell cigarette smoke, it will be extremely annoying and distressing. In some well known restaurants, smoking is completely banned or either have a smoking area. However, in some small restaurants,  canteens or bars, there is no restriction for smoking at all and smokes are everywhere which make the people who are having meal unpleasant and uncomfortable. Another point is that I have hyperosmia and I am very sensitive to odour. So, when someone is smoking either near me or even at a distance, the smoke comes very quickly through my nose and I become suffocated, and consequently lose my temper. I usually have lunch at school canteen and there are always people smoking around my table. At such times, I can neither get rid of them nor have my lunch anymore. So, I just have to get out of there even if I have not finished my meal. This is just my personal reason why I want smoking to be banned in every public places, especially in restaurants.
     To wrap up, I firmly recommend that all restaurants in the country should ban smoking because of health issues, air pollution and public policy.
