Most people say that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I totally agree with that. It can be said that college students are old enough to take care of themselves and to start to earn money. As they are still studying, there is no doubt that they cannot have full-time jobs. So, part-time jobs are really suitable for them. Today, it is not a strange thing for a college student to have a part-time job. Not every college student has one ,but they are quite familiar with part-time jobs. There are several reasons why part-time jobs are effective for students. First of all, the students can earn their own pocket money. Of course, salary for a part-time would not cover all their tuition fees and living costs. However, this salary will help them to some extent. Secondly, having a part-time job will help them improve their communicative skills. Since they have a job, they will have to work in an organization. They will have to talk with people with cleverness whether they like it or not. Thirdly, they will possess better problem solving skills. They will have to deal with problems at their workplace. And, they will have to think of possible solutions and try to solve them on their own. Furthermore, they will feel more confident if they have a job. They will become much more mature than before. To sum up, I would not say that college students must have part-time jobs. Nevertheless, they should have part-time jobs which can provide them many advantages, if they have the chance and ability.
