 I am under the impression that smoking, especially , in the most crowded area like restaurant can have bad impact to our society's healthcare system. To make the matter worse, passive-smoking can be a big threat to each and every human's healthy life. That is why, I strongly agree with the above statement.
When I was in RC2, I used to have my lunch at canteen and there, I saw so many students smoking and vaping in the middle of the crowd. I felt so annoyed and, sometimes, I couldn't bare the smell of cigarette. After having my lunch at canteen three days in a row, I got coughing badly and, eventually , I chose not to have my lunch at the school canteen. At this point, my experience says how smoking can harm a person's healthy life.
In Japan, the majority of Japanese restaurants offer two options-- non-smoking seats or smoking seats. People can choose whatever they want. In that way, they reduce the escalating of smoking-caused disease. Our government should prohibit smoking in crowded area. We citizens have to follow the rules set by our government not only for our own good but also for every person's own good.
