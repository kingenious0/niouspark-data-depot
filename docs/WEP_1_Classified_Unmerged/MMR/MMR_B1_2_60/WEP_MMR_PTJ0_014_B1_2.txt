I strongly agree with that fact as I am a college student who needs to get extra money for outfits, snacks and hanging out with friends. Even though I am still in my country where I can use money as much as I want to and can get pocket money every week from my family, I still need part time job to buy  extra fancy things like belt, fake nails, socks, boots, and something like that. And I also want to use much amount of money when I hang out or go luxury restaurants or cafes to take nice and attractive photographs which is a very famous trend among youths. I am very sorry receiving money besides pocket money from my family at this age. That will be a good opportunity and chance if we can get part time job in my country. If so, I won't need any extra money from my family and I can improve my working skills with that experience. On the other hand, if I study abroad, I do need more money since colleges' tuition fees are kinda expensive for international students. Therefore, we all will to get part time job to get sufficient amount of money for living costs. If not, I can't  continue to learn there as I am not that rich. These are the reasons why I think that it is important for college students to have a part time job.
