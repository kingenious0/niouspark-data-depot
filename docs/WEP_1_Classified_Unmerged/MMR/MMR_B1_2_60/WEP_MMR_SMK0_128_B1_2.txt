"In this day and age, the number of smokers has been increasing gradually.We can see people smoking even in public areas, especially restaurants. Personally, I believe that smoking should be banned in restaurants.
Smoking affects not only the person who smokes but also the people around them. Restaurants are places where many people come and sit for a long time to enjoy food. If someone smokes in a restaurant, many people may be exposed to the harmful influence of secondhand smoke. An action of a person can ruin many people's lives through smoking. Therefore, it is the first reason not to allow smoking in restaurants.
Secondly, I believe that it is an ethical and respectful choice not to smoke in public places like restaurants. Even if the person who smokes can take the risk of their health, they must consider other people's health. They should be careful about their actions when it can negatively affect other people. Thus, I believe it is disrespectful to smoke in restaurants.
For a third reason, smoking in restaurants can destroy other people's enjoyment. Many people come to restaurants to have a marvelous time with their beloved ones, such as family dinner or friends gathering.If the area is filled with smoke, it interrupts the pleasure of people who want to enjoy their meal. Many people, including me, are intolerant of smoke, coughing a lot and having a headache. 
Some people will claim that it is acceptable to smoke in a smoking area in a restaurant. However, many restaurants do not have smoking areas. As a matter of fact, it is more unlikely to add a smoking area in each and every restaurant, especially in underdeveloped countries.
The unethical, irresponsible, and disrespectful actions of every smoking person can affect other people both physically and emotionally. Therefore, these are the reasons why smoking should not be allowed in restaurants.
