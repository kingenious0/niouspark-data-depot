 Smoking  should be banned at all restaurants in the country. As everybody knows, smoking is not good. Everything has pros and cons. But smoking has no advantages but many disadvantages. It causes health problems such as cancer of the lungs. Moreover, smoking is one of the reasons of air pollution. Young people think that smoking can make them fashionable and smart. But it is not totally true. Smoking is like burning money. Smoking harms smokers as well as the people around the smokers. Smoking is very annoying for other people especially in restaurants. Restaurant is the place where many people or consumers have. So, there will be many passive smokers if there is smoker in the restaurant. Besides, consumers are adults as well as children. Smoking' s disadvantages affects children more than adults. Smoking in front of the children will produce many smokers in the future because children can imitate wrong habits easily. In my opinion, this is the key point to ban smoking at the restaurants. So, smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country.  Smoking is not good for ourselves and also for environment. Therefore, smoking is need to be reduced and in the future,  smoking should literally disappear.
