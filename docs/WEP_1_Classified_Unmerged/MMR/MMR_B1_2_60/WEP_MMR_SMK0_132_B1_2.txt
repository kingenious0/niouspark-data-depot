Smoking is a popular culture in all around the world. Some people love it and some feel annoyed about it. Smoking has many disadvantages, however, people smoke according to different situations and emotions. Some smoke with desicipline and some do not. In that moment, the surrounding people do not like it and feel uncomfortable about it. Especially in crowded places like restaurants, people should not smoke. Therefore I strongly agree that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. Restaurants are places to have great meal and spend quality time with our beloved ones. So smoke should not be a obstruction in that place. Moreover it is a place where seats are placed side by side and if there are children near the one who smoke, it is not good for gentle hearts of children which do not have good immune system. Moreover, smoking in public area is not acceptable and it should fine if they smoke in public area.In conclusion, in my point of view, smoking should be banned not only in public area but also in at all the  restaurants in the country.
