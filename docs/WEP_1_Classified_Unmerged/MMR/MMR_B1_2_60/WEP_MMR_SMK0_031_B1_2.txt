Smoking cigarettes is an addiction common among many individuals. If you look around, you may see a lot of smokers in public areas, such as restaurants, parks, shopping malls, etc. There are debates about whether smoking should be banned or not. While there's people saying that it causes a lot of serious damages, there's some who are against banning, saying it's their right to do so. Personally, I'm with the ones who support banning smoking in public areas.
Although, it's their free will to do whatever they desire, no good will come of it by smoking, not just in public areas, but also in private areas. There could be a lot of people, in public places, including children, older people, pregnant women, and those with different health issues, who might not be able to
tolerate smoking. Obviously, smoking can seriously damage one's health and cause some major diseases associated especially with lung. In fact, it's going to affect those who are inhaling those smokes whether they're the smokers themselves or non-smokers.
Another reason why I'm against smoking in public spaces is that it is an awful influence to minors. For example, children can eventually imitate the smokers and start the unhealthy habit of smoking. In fact, smoking at a young age could potentially ruin their life. Furthermore, smoking certainly pollutes the air and it can irritate the individuals around the area, who want some fresh and clean air and It might even cause some unnecessary conflicts.
For the reasons above, the most effective way to maintain a healthy, clean and safe environment for everyone is to permanently ban smoking in public areas.
