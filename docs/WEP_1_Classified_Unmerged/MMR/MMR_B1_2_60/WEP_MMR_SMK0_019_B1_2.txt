Yes, I am totally agree with this. Everybody know well that smoking kills people. But, the prohibition is too loose and so people don't scare of smoking freely even in public and university. There is a ban on smoking in some places like campus and dormitory but the onlookers are not that strict with that. They usually turn a blind eye to some minor case, that is, they also think of smoking as minor case. Most youngsters commonly have a bash at smoking and are overwhelmed by smoking. Some are compulsive and can't give up it throughout the rest of life and die young. In public place like restaurand, there may be the consumers who suffer from the lung deseases and stuff like that. If there is not a ban on it, those who around the smoker will find it annoying having the food in this way. Socially, they will not blame each other explicitly but the name of the restaurant can be besmirched. We all exactly know that every restaurat should give the service that is not only clean and comfortable but also hygenic. To so, they must put a ban on smoking.
