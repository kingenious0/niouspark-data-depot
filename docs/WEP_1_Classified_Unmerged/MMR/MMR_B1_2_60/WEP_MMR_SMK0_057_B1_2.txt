 Smoking is an unhealthy habit which harms not only the smoker but also the people around them. Since smoking 
does no good and can cause serious health problems, it should be banned to smoke in public areas. Therefore, I completely agree with this statement.

First of all, smoking in public areas such as restaurants annoys other people who do not smoke. A restaurant is a place where all kinds of people come and enjoy food. When a person smokes in the restaurant, other people around him are exposed to smoky air and smell as well. This would absolutely affect one's enjoyment on his meals. For me, I cannot enjoy my food at all when the surrounding smells disgusting.

In addition, smoking in restaurants leads to passive-smoking. This is because we are very likely to breathe in the smoke exhaled by those who are smoking near us. As a result of it, we, passive-smokers, will end up suffering from lung cancer and other extreme respiratory problems. Furthermore, those who do not smoke feel very stressed and anxious when among smokers. It can be harmful to various groups of people such as pregnant women, elderly people, and children. For instance, if a person smokes in a restaurant, the smoke that comes from burning cigarettes fills the atmosphere in the restaurant and it is difficult for other people to adjust to the environment filled with cigarette smoke.

On the other hand, some argue that banning smoking would break the rights of smokers. However, they can still smoke in open areas. Thus, I believe a ban would not violate the rights of smokers.

In conclusion, smoking in restaurants can pose annoyance to non-smokers, passive-smoking and harms on many people. Hence, I totally agree with this topic.
