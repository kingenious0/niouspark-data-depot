 Firstly , we can see the advertisements for smoking products all over the world throughout television and social media. Most developing countries have the lack of health knowledges. In some developing countries, there is age limit for selling cigarettes to citizens. They can't sell cigarettes to the students under 18. But as we know, in other developing countries including Myanmar , they sell the smoking products to the kids without checking their ages . Because they only want money and they think it is an unnecessary and unimportant thing . So there have been increasing the number of smokers in our country day by day . We can see in our eyesight the kids are holding a cigarette in their fingers and pretending they are so cool . Their parents can't stop their sons because even environment and society can't stop the increasing numbers of under age smokers. 



Starting from this case, people are smoking everywhere . They don't even care the other people's conditions . When you are eating in a restaurant, you have to eat with the smoke and you will cough because of the smoke. How would you react to that smoker ? . For me , I will tell and warn him directly in front of the crowd  not to smoke inside a restaurant . Smoking in a restaurant can annoy the people who are enjoying the food peacefully. And the most important thing to remind themselves is it is a public place . Government should built a place like smoking area in anywhere because government can't stop increasing numbers of smoker. So , in conclusion , government which has the responsibility should ban smoking in restaurants and must put some smoking area away from the other people .
