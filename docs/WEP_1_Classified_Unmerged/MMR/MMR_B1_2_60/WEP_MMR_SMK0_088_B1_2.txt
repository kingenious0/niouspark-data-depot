   Smoking can be harmful to one's health as well as the health of others around the smoker.  Additionally, the cigarette has a terrible smell.  Smoking can lead to lung, heart, and other diseases as well as cancer.  When women give birth, smoking might be difficult for them as well.  Smoking is not only harmful to pregnant women, but also to others around them.  We ought to be cautious not to smoke either outside or within the restaurant.  Smoking at a restaurant not only endangers its customers but also causes air pollution that contributes to global warming.  Each year, smoking claimed the lives of a large number of people.  Everybody gets poisoned by smoking.especially for children or students.  They are intellectually highly curious.  They need not to use it for harmful activities like smoking.  Their life has only just begun.  They have a bright future ahead of them.
    Cigarettes, in my opinion, are not really necessary in our daily lives. Even if we didn't smoke, we could still lead a happy and healthy life.  Because of this, I believe that smoking ought to be outright prohibited everywhere, particulary in restaurants.
