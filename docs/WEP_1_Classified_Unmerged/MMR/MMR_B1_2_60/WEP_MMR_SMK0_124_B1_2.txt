"While some people are saying ""Smoking is bad for every part of your body "" , some people might declare "" If smoking is not allowed in heaven, I shall not go"". There are such kind of people, who know exactly how bad smoking is for our health and yet can't help but keep smoking. Some even say that smoking is like being in a toxic but sweet relationship. Once we became addicted to something, it is really tough to free ourselves. First, we start it as having a taste and then before we even know, it becomes a habit and follow us and stick with us all the time. Even simple things like watching a series, reading books can make you obsessive. Smoking is totally bad for not only smokers but also the surrounding. However, in my opinion, smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Just like if someone tries to stop us from watching our favorite show and say it is not just that great, we will definitely get angry and unsatisfied. So we should respect the human rights of the smokers who seriously love smoking more than their own well-being and we should create and provide facilities for them. For example, providing a smoking zone in a certain place of the restaurants. Banning completely cannot not always be a good way to maintain a situation and sometimes, it can even cause unnecessary chaos as in human nature, the urge of wanting to do something more especially if that something is forbidden.We should respect them and in return they should respect non-smokers. So without creating tension, we should find a common base and sort out the best solution which is favorable for both sides.
