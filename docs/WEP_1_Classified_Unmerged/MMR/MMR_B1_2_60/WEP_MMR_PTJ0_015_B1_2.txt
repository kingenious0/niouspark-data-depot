 I agree with the fact that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. When we are in college, we cost a lot on textbooks, food, transportation, clothes, etc. It can cost more for a person who attends college from another town. Doing a part-time job can have the benefit. You can get your own income, so, you don't need to depend on your parents for pocket money.
And you can also buy the things that you want to buy. Doing a part-time job is a chance to explore new things. We can learn new experiences and lessons about work. And we can be aware of what are we interested in? or what are we great at. And we can also say that I am not unemployed. But there has also a disadvantage to doing a part-time job as a student. We can have less time for studying and we can't study well because we are exhausted. However, if we choose the correct time to work and balance our time on school and work, we can get a lot of benefits. Above  reasons, I agree with the fact that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
