 Smoking is widely regarded as a bad habit that harms both smokers and others who are exposed to cigarette smoke. The demand for stronger smoking rules has increased as public health and well-being become more valued by societies. Most restaurants in this country should be smoke-free, but not all of them. Despite being unhealthy, some people think that smoking helps us relieve tension.
In Myanmar, most of the restaurants have smoking restrictions in place to protect the public's health. Considering that it contains more than 7,000 chemicals, containing a minimum of 70 that can cause cancer, secondhand smoke is considered to be a serious health risk. Smokers not only endanger their own health but also the health of others around them when they enter restaurants and smoke. A complete smoking ban would produce a smoke-free environment, lowering the risk of cancer, heart disease, and respiratory issues among consumers as well as employees.

Personally I think, it is hard to enforce a smoking prohibition throughout every restaurant in Myanmar, a country with a large population of outgoing youths who want to be stylish and smart by smoking. But it is our responsibility to build safer, healthier environments and to protect everyone's right to enjoy public areas without harming their health. So smoking should be banned at all restaurants.
