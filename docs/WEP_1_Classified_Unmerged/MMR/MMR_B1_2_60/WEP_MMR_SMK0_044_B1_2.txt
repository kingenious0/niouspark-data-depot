 I don't think banning smoking from all the restaurant in the country is simple nor possible. I know it is important to protect public health and create a smoking-free environment, I don't think banning it is not the right answer. If we want to raise a smoking-free place, we should start by marking off smoking areas. Restaurants cannot always keep an eye out for smoker or drag him out of the place. There are restaurants that ban smoking in the country. But, people still smoke in the blind spot. I am not saying that we should let them smoke in the restaurants. My point is that banning smoking from all the restaurants across the country is a complex matters that requires a lot of time and proper rules. The side effect of breathing the secondhand smoke is as dangerous as the primary smokers. Many people are diagnosed with various diseases including cancer because of smoking. Instead of banning smoking from all the restaurants in the country, we should try to spread  public awareness about smoking more effectively and give specific smoking areas around restaurants where it's a bit far from public. Therefore, I think it will be a bit challenging to ban smoking from all the restaurants in the country.
