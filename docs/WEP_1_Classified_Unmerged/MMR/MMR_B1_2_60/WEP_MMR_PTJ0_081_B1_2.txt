 Part time job is the job that isn't permanent for a whole day. We can work part time job for a period when we are free. So part time jobs are very appropriate for the college students like us because we don't get full enough time for a whole working day. We have to get to the school and classes to attend. That's why part time jobs have advantages for students as we can work in our free time.

          As a college student 's priority duty is to get to the school , learning and studying, we only have to depend on the parents . We depend our parents for our school fees, pocket money and many kinds of costs. Sometimes there is a moment that we can't be enough with our pocket money and we don't want to ask to our parents again. Moreover, to save our parents cost for us we can help by working part time jobs. By working part time job , we can get extra money of our own and we can buy and use for whatever we want to spend without asking money from our parents. And we can save our parent's costs for us and we can even be like good clever child. To solve that kind of case as a college student , there have part time jobs. And there are also advantages of working part time job as a college student. Before getting a job as a adult , we can get to know experiences what a work industry looks really like. In my opinion, any kind of work experiences can make us more mature and responsible.To conclude, having a part time job for a college student is really important.
