                                         I'm not sure where to start talking about this.In my opinion, students should have part -time job.Beacuse part-time job can adjust to the University's class schedule.From part-time job, students can  get experience  to enter the workplace  after school .Let's talk about the main points  we will rely ourselves,will help parents,will get experience , will get brave and will confidence on ourselves.Part-time jobs help a lot in the educational process for students.Even though working while studying is tiring, it is also a great honor.In another countries, most students study at university while working part-time jobs.Working part-time job while studying at the University  is good practice.Every time we look back at the past, we will be proud for we relied on ourselves.we should get more experience at a young age.

              For a university student, having a part-time job provides a lot of support.Students will better understand the value of money.At first, it's tiring, but later it will fine.So I think students should have a part-time job.
