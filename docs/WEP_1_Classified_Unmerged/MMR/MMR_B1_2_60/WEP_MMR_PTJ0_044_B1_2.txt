Before we talk about how is it important or not to have a part time job for college student, we must admit that almost all the parents from Southeast Asian countries don't like or allow their child to work during their college life for many reasons. It is very uncommon to work while also doing your studies especially in our country, Myanmar. However, I, personally, think that every student should work along with their studies. Honestly, I even want to suggest to take a gap year after graduating high school. That way,  you can actually learn what fields of studies you interested and what skills are actually essential to survive in the real world. Getting good grades doesn't mean you rule in life. One more thing is that the thought, the view and the perspective to the world change once you actually been in a real-life work place. I, myself, didn't have a chance to work in my early years of college life. I spent my time going out with my friends, and when I have to study, I just learnt them by head. But, I got a chance to experience what the real world is like when I worked as a digital marketing account executive during my years. I feel like I wasted my years and what I learn in school didn't prepare me for this. Now that I continue my studies while also working  freelance, I can feel that not only my academic skills grow but also my personal growth is also  improving. With that harmonious growth, I feel like that I finally have a clue about what coming. Studying becomes more  relatable and enjoyable. That 's I fully agree with the supposition that it is important for college students to have a part time job.
