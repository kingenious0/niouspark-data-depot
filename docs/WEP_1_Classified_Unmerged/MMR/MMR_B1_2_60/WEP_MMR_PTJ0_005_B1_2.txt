 Youths would like to earn money while attending their university courses. Lack of job opportunities in everywhere
makes our youths hopeless. By doing part time jobs, they can achieve many experience from learning their  
mistakes. When they are working partime, they no longer have to worry about being able to afford the basic essential
and they can buy everything they need by saving their incomes. They can also  build their professional network
and  after they graduate,when there are vacancies relating to their field, they can join easily. In some companies, 
they do not get a job not because they are weak in educational skills but because they do not have any work
experience in which the companies are asking for. With a good looking resume, it would not be that hard to get a job. 
However, in a different point of view, taking part in  part time jobs will give them pressure which are hard to handle. 
Moreover, they will not have enough time to study their lessons at home. As for me, with the experience of working in food 
production industry for nearly two years, I have learned that having a job is a power which makes myself confident among 
any other teenagers.  In conclusion,I agree that our community should give a chance for youths to do part time jobs   
when they are attending their university courses.
