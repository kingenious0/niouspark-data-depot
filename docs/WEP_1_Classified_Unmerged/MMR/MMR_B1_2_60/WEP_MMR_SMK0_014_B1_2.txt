As everyone knows, smoking has been very popular throughout the history. A lot of people smokes in any ages. They all start smoking just because they want to get experience how it is look like or taste. They all like to smoke when they want to chill or get rid of depression. Then they beacome addicted and begin to smoke in any public area. I personally agree that smoking should be ban at all restaurants since Smoking provide a lot of disadvantages such as harming  air pollution and rising global warming. Especially in places like restaurants, there will be many different kinds of people who come to have their meal peacefully. It is okay if the people around are middle age but for the kids and old people, smoking can be very annoying. They may not have the ability to smell the cigarette which can harm their lungs directly even though they don't smoke . It is better to have our meal without any disturb. Smoking makes our environment dirty and causes air pollution and also causes lungs cancer diseases. To prevent it, we should restrict smoking areas not only to reduce their smoking times but also prevent people from suffering lungs cancers caused by people who smoke. 
These are the reasons why smoking shoube banned at all the restaurants .
