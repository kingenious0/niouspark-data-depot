 College students face several difficulties outside of their studies in the fast-paced, demanding world of today, including growing tuition fees and increased living expenditures. Additionally, attending college cannot guarantee that we will earn more money than non-college graduates. Therefore, when we have so much energy, we need to look at the real world. Because of this, we ought to work during our college years, or at least try. Although there aren't many part-time jobs in Myanmar. We are able to work odd jobs or support our parents' organizations. 
The financial burden on college students and their families can be lessened if they can find a part-time work that can generate a consistent income to help cover these expenses. College students who work for their money might gain a feeling of responsibility and practical knowledge of financial management that will benefit them throughout their life. But we must constantly remind ourselves that we work part-time jobs to supplement our income. We must stop or seek another occupation if our part-time job interferes with our studies.

In my opinion, we should work a part-time job to build our professional networks since we are college students. Additionally, part-time employment exposes college students to a variety of coworkers, managers, and customers. These connections offer networking opportunities, which could be very helpful for their professional goals in the future.
