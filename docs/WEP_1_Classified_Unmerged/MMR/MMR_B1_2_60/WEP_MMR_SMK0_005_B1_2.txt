 I agree that smoking should be completely banned in restuarants . Imagine that when we are having a meal,smoke   
from the cigarattes come into our nose and disturb the smell coming from our tasty food,it will be so awful. 
Although I smoke sometimes, I totally know that smoking harms our lungs which we breathe oxygen in and out. 
Smoking harms not only the person who smokes but also the people around him or her. We have learned in our
childhood that cigarettes consist of nicotine that speeds up the messages travelling between brain and body.
What it all boils down to is the fact that smokers have a right to smoke. So, in addition to the fact that smoking 
should be banned in restuarants, there need to have a small place outside the restuarant where smoking is 
allowed.  As a matter of fact,  burmese people started to smoke with rolled corn leave since  before cigarettes 
were born.  In Nat festivals, burmese people offered tobacco cigarettes to honour Taungbyon Brothers. Knowingly
the cigarettes are very bad for our health, some taditions make the festivals and cigarette unseparable. Although 
the packaging of cigarettes today are covered with the ''disadvantages of smoking'' stickers, there are always people
who asked for cigarettes  soon after arriving the restuarants. In conclusion, we should try our best to stop people 
from smoking not only to prevent them but also to prevent ourselves.
