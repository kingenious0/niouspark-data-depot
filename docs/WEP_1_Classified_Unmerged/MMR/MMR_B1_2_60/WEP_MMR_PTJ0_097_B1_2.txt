I agree with that statement.l think teenagers must  be independent.Also They need to know the psychology of money.If They were work as waiter or waitress, they improve in their communication. We can pay  school charges by ourselve.It hetp us to wide our view about the society .If you want to be employerof someone group,you have to know the feeling  of employee.This is my provage that I believe.By doing parttime job ,we can learn what type of person should be trusted or not. College student are the person that they will be leader in the future.So,they have to be contact every part of the society.They can learn the way how to manage the workers and what is the important part of the countary.It have not only advantages but also disadvantages.When teenager know the feeling of using their money, they don't want to be finishes the college.They must face the unfair of employer.Sometime they feel depressed and tired.This can help them to face with their fortune changing. In our country ,this statement cannot be made.So l want to  build the company that respect ability more than certification or degree.Thus, everyone can work together and equally and I believe myself that I can do it.
