 I agree with the statement   smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country    for a little.The reason why I agree this statement a little is that smoking doesn't  need to banned seriously,they just need to give a smoking area.Smoking can ruin not only the health of the smoker himself but also the health of people nearby him,whom we know the 'Second smoker'.
If you have seen many brand of cigarette,you have already seen that words 'smoking can ruin your health' .They also know the disadvantages of smoking but they still selling them for commercial.If there is a customer ,they will also have the seller.So,we can't stop selling the cigarettes but we can ban it in some important places.Restaurants need to ban the smoking but not every restaurant.If the restaurant is for family gatherings,birthday parties for children,that should really ban smoking in the restaurant and for other restaurants,they just put a place for smoking area or smoking room.
There are many places in the world that can't smoke in that areas.Especially in foreign countries,almost every restaurant and other places has smoking area that help to protect the ruin of people health who doesn't smoke.The government announces the rule for smoking and punishments.For the conclusion,I agree that   smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country   for a little because not every restaurant need to ban smoking
