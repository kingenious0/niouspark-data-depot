In my opinion, there is no saying  No  or disagreement for this statement. There are so many who are suffering from lung diseases. They may include those who smoke themselves, or those who breathe in the smoke, or those who have this disease since they were born. The smoke from cigarettes or whatever is so annoying that I cannot really stand it. Honestly, I had been smoking for one year and then I found out that I could not stand tiring anymore and moreover, I often felt that I could not get enough oxygen so I had to take deep breath. Therefore, I made up my mind to stop smoking and surprisingly I still cannot stand the smoke. Researchers said that not only smoking but also breathing the smoke can cause same effects. We all know that in public area like restaurants and bus-stop, there are so many types of people who smoke or do not smoke. Both those who do not smoke and those who have lung diseases can be annoyed by the smoke of cigarettes and the smoke can harm you and your environment. Being healthy is a blessing, so don't destroy it. Those are the reasons why smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country.
