 I agree with the statement  Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country  because the smoke coming out from the cigarettes while smoking in the restaurants not only harms the other customers' health but also disturbs the respiration system of the customers in the restaurants. 
I don't like smoking and I always feel disappointed when there are people who are smoking around me as the smoke makes me hard to breathe.  The most important thing is that everyone must avoid smoking in public areas like in the restaurant, in the library, at the bus stop, etc. It is one of the most basic etiquettes in our lifetime.
Some restaurants are air-conditioned and that's why they have to close all the windows. In this type of restaurants, smoking must be totally banned.
Next, there are young children who come to the restaurants with their parents. Therefore, when they see the people smoking, they can imitate that smoking habit as they can be mistaken that smoking makes them cool. Moreover, the cigarettes smoke is not good for their health. Smoking in the restaurant can affects not only the health of the one who smoke but also the health of customers.
Some restaurants have smoking area so that one can go there to smoke. In this way, not only the one who wants to smoke but also the customers in the restaurants will be fine. Actually, smoking does not have any good benefit and it will be the best if we can quit smoking for our health.
