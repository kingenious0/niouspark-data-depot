 Nowadays,Other country's people work a part time job are wide But Myanmar can't wide and we can't get a lot of money. So,Myanmar parents don't allowed for part-time job. At first,I want to talk advantages pf part time job . It can get own money.We can buy everything we want our own money.We can buy a book for school.We can freedoms for everytime. We collect our own money for future.We can survive our parents ,younger sister and brother for studying.Another advantage of having a part time job is that students can acquire more experiences and polish their skills. For example, if someone enjoys teaching, working part-time as a tutor may help him or her improve their teaching skills and gain experiences. Many schools require student teaching experience as a part of the curriculum.Second is the disadvantages of Part time -job because we have our own pipes, I can do what I want to do and ruin it. We can't give our study time. We can tired between work and study.We haven't relax time. As a result, they get exhausted, and may even skip classes to take a nap after a long day of hard work. Moreover, they may experience stress due to a difficult or time-consuming project. Also, it can endanger their health mentally and physically. Physically, if a person puts too much pressure on his body. So,I don't agree to work the college student for part-time job.
