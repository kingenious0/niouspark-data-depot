I absolutely agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. As you all know, places like restaurants are public places have all kinds of people. The smoke that comes from cigarettes is bad for young babies and old men women. Some people even have asthma and smoking hurts not only the smoker but also the surrounding people. The smoke kills the plants and it is bad for the environment. It is not good for the smoker's lungs. Smoking hurts other people's health too. Imagine a baby accidentally breathes in the smoke, her lungs will damage and she could even get lung cancer. People who smoke has weaker lungs than normal people. They tend to live shorter lives and they don't get enough oxygen because of weak lungs. Smoking at the restaurants could start a fire as the most restaurants use gas to cook. Even if you really want to smoke, you should avoid smoking in public places. Plants live on air that was breathed out by humans so smoking will ruin their photosynthesis. It can cause the air pollution. People wouldn't like it because the tables at the restaurant are placed so closely. It would ruin the appetite.  If you really want to smoke, you should go to smoking areas and go smoke there. Although it would be the best if you don't smoke at all.
