 I used to be a smoker when I was 16 because I was very eager to try everything at that time. However, I have not been smoked since turning 17 because of knowing that it was not good for my health. It is even worse for second smoker than the actual smoker. However, I also know that there some smokers who always follow the regulations in the restaurants. Actually, I get some suspense about choosing side in this topic. Therefore, I have to sit on the fence this time.
Obviously, smoking is not good. It is a universal truth. Nicotine, the main ingredient of cigarettes, is not good for our lungs. Smoke can also help air pollution, one of the most vital problems that we are trying to solve nowadays. Then, it can also cause some diseases like cancer, lung diseases, diabetes and so on. If a smoker is smoking cigarettes at public places, not only the actual smoker but also everyone who accidently inhales that smoke are endangered. That is why you should not smoke at public areas.
On the other hand, I also know that most of the smokers give their respect to others by smoking only in some places where smoking is allowed like smoker in the train, smoking area of restaurants and so on. Obviously, they do not disturb to anyone and they are just chilling in their own world. It is also very clear that smoke from cigarettes is just one of the smallest points that can cause air pollution.
Therefore, I do not want to talk what is suitable. It is a win-win situation for me. Whatever happens happens, I will agree with that. If you want to ban, you can. If you do not want to, it is up to you.
