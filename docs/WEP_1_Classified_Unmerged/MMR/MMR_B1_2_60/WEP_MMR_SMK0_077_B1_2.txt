 Smoking is not a good habit for everyone. Especially for those who are suffering from a serious heart disease, smoking is totally a terrible action that has a great effect upon them. The smoke of a cigarette which is just gray gas has an unbearably powerful ability that can damage any being's lives. 

First of all, we all know that smoking is bad for everyone regardless of their genders,age,nationality and religion. The worst part is there are silly people knowing the consequences of what will happen to them if they smoke but still keep doing it without caring much about it.Secondly, it's a general idea that we should not smoke near a certain type of people who can't stand the smoke, including children and patients. Just a single cigarette consisting of an enormous amount of harmful chemical substances can even put people in bad health. However, if someone is affected by your smoking, it would be so unfair for someone who has to endure those bad outcomes for things he didn't do. Therefore,we need to avoid smoking in public areas. In public places such as restaurants, hospitals and also an aircon room, having someone smoking beside us is an irritating and uncomfortable event. In that kind of case,there is no exception and everyone would agree that they all feel the same. Sometimes, it may be rude to ask someone to stop smoking even though it is a must-do action. In case of that situation, the restaurants should ban smoking so that a better atmosphere would enhance the customers' feelings.

In conclusion,I agree with the topic    Smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country   . The only one who can make a better environment is nothing else but the better people.
