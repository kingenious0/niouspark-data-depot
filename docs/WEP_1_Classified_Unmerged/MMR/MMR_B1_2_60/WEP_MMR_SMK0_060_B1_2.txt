A restaurant is a place where all kinds of people can come and enjoy the meals. Since it is a public area, any behavior that can be regarded as inappropriate or rude should be banned. In my opinion, I absolutely agree that smoking should be banned in restaurants as it can bring disadvantages. Firstly, we all know that smoking is not good for health and that it can give trouble not only to the one who smokes but also to the ones nearby. Restaurants are places where we can have a lot of people. Secondly, people of all ages can come to restaurants. There may be babies, kids, teenagers, adults and the elderly. Smoking in a restaurant can be dangerous especially for kids, pregnant women and people with health issues. They cannot stand the smokes for long. Moreover, it is where we can have family reunions, family dinners, important conversations and celebrating birthdays. One should not ruin these moments with smokes and making things go wrong. But, we also need to think for the people who smoke. What if they want to smoke real bad?  This is the reason why public areas including restaurants have smoking areas. To conclude, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
