 Smoking cigarettes comes in many forms. Some as a habit, some to forget a bad day while others wanted to be seen as fashionable in people's eyes. It does not matter what the reason is, I think it is not a good thing. And this fact does not apply only to the smokers but also the people around them. People have different level of resistance in their body for all the diseases and side-effects of various chemicals. Smoking is not something that can be done alone quietly. As the word imply,  smoking  gives off  smoke  in the air especially when we are in an enclosed room it really troubles and annoys people. So I think, smoking should be banned at all the restaurant in the country. 
In developed countries, there are places marked as smoking area, everywhere. In companies, they have smoking rooms separately for the employees and when a person has done smoking, he must use the spray to erase the smell of cigarettes so that no one would be annoyed by the smell. Also in restaurants, when a customer comes in, they would always ask the customer where he or she would sit because there are two kinds of table. The table for the people who smoke and the table for who does not. However, for the developing countries with various types of people with various mindsets and knowledge, smoking is a serious problem which is hard to take control. So, even if the things and situations cannot be changed instantly like in some developing countries, we should start by banning smoking at the restaurants. Because, if the citizens cannot even protect or follow a simple rule in a restaurant, how come they will develop into a country with high standard living with healthy life.
