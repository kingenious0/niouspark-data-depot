 Being a university student, I think that it is important to get good grades at any level of education since the world goes good grades, good jobs and good salaries. On the other hand, we shouldn't load up our parents when we are at the age of being able to stand on our own. So, in my opinion, a student should have a part-time job to pay the bill.
By working a part-time job, it increases our working experiences, improves our communication skills and takes one more step to the reality. We can boost our confident at such work as we repeat the progress day by day. Moreover, we should train ourselves to take responsibility at least for ourselves when life is like a survival show. Good grades to make our parents proud of, good jobs to make good impression of society and good salaries to pay back our parents' gratitude. 
Of course, multi-tasking is not an easy job. We have to split time and energy evenly and we also need to consider all the possibilities that can urgently be happened out of blue. It can be exhausted and tiring process but nothing comes easy. We have to take time to get used to it. 
As an Asian, helping our parents is one of the basic manners that we were taught since birth. We should be in our own care even if we couldn't be able to support our parents with our own income. What kind of role we are taking in our life when a grown up human can't afford to pay up his living expenses. It is a shame not only to our parents but also to the society that we are living. I hope that everyone can balance their career and their life equally in this adventurous wonderful life.
