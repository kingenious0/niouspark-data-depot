I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job as the college fees and food that we eat are so expensive these days. And we can't rely on our parents for every single thing. We can have working experiences when we apply for jobs at companies. When we apply for scholarships, these working experiences can help us as some scholarships ask us if we have any experience or not. We can not only make friends but also improve our social skills. We can attend language courses with our own salary. We all have places to spend like college books, food, necessities, hostel fees and others. We can also save our money for buying things that we want or need. For me, I like collecting plushy and books. So, a part-time job is perfect for us to be independent. Later, we have to earn money by ourselves. So, we should practice making money from part-time jobs and also we can have fun. Normally, we spend our time doing nothing so why not do a part-time job. If you want to give money to your parents back because they have been spending all their money just for you, you can give them back with your own salary. You can learn many experiences based on what kind of job. And that is why I think it is important to have a part-time job.
