 After we pass the high school graduation state , we can do a job legally because we are 18 and college students .  As a child , we got pocket money from our parents daily to buy and eat snacks at school . But when we become college students ,  there are so many things that costs much than our limits and we want to spend on many other things which are necessary or unnecessary . So we don't enough with pocket money from parents and think we have to do something to earn excess money. But we can't get a job easily because we haven't graduated yet . Only thing that a teenager student can do is a part time job. While we are doing a part time job, we can earn excess for our necessities without pressuring our parents.

Moreover , nowadays young people want to do new experiences before they get a job. In my opinion, I think gaining experiences is good for later before applying a job because most of the companies employ the  incoming newbies with experience. It can be easier to get higher salary and higher honor in company if you have already experienced something related to your industry . And also , when you apply for a scholarship to study abroad , they will ask you  Have you done volunteering in some places and experiencing some jobs outside the college or university ? . In conclusion, the facts that have been mentioned above are the important ones for college students for having a part-time job.
