 I agree with the statement   smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country  . The particular reason for this is that smoking can ruin not only the health of the smoker himself but also the health of the people around him, whom we call the   second smoker  . 

There are a lot of known and unknown components in a cigar or a cigarette such as nicotine and tar. These are the chemicals which can destroy the smoker's lungs by causing cancer or other diseases. Many smokers smoke at places like bus stops, bars, markets, etc. But restaurants are a place for family gatherings where elderly or young kids will be. So I feel like people who smoke shouldn't be smoking at their tables since the fumes can get to the kids or the people of old age. Also, some people may be allergic to the components or the ingredients included in the cigarette.

In many countries, there are places, smoking areas, made specifically for smoking which can be accessed at no cost. In airports of some countries, I've seen rooms or benches outside for the smokers to smoke so that the fumes won't be lingering around other people who don't smoke. If people smoke at the places that aren't the smoking area, the government punishes them by the law. I feel like this law should also be applied to the restaurants for the health of the majority who don't want to eat or stay near the fumes of the cigarette.
