 I strongly agree that It's important to have part-time jobs for college students.  Part-time jobs give many opportunities to the youths for their future as well as for the community.
  Firstly, part-time jobs teach us not to waste time and to be organise in our life. There is no doubt that time management skills will surely improve from part-time jobs as you need to balance with both coursework and your job. Most Students depend on their parents for their needs. But if you have a part-time job, your  income will earn monthly and it can help to pay your  bills. Therefore, part-time jobs will boost self-confidence and make you feel independent.
It can also to appreciate the value of money. As a college student, you must work hard and take responsibility for the job. That makes you know the value of money realizing how hard it is to earn it.  Part-time jobs can build a strong social circle in the community. It's because Students have to deal with many people in their job and that also gives courage to them to communicate  not only to colleagues but also to classmates and teachers confidently in the presentation.It is obvious that your social networking will develop from the part-time jobs.
   Nowadays, There are also students who do part-time jobs not for their income. They volunteer for non-profit organisations to strengthen their scholarship opportunities and also to develop the community as much as they can. To sum up, part-time jobs enhance our personal life and give many helpful to our society.
