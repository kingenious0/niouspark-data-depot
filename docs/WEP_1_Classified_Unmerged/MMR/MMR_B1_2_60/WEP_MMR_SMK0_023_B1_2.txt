 We all know that smoking can affect largely on health as well as serious lung disease such as lung cancer. Sadly, almost every man smoke everywhere nowadays. But not everyone likes the smell of the cigarettes. That is why smoking should completely be banned in certain places like in restaurants.
People often goes to restaurant not only to have meal but also to relax. So, many tend to smoke more, and some might develop a habit of smoking in the restaurants. This makes their addiction harder to quit.
Restaurants are places where people come to enjoy their meal with their family or loved ones, or maybe alone. So if someone smokes, those who are not fond of the smell of the cigarettes could feel suffocating. Second-smoker can also have health issue as much as the one who smokes. Especially, when people are trying to enjoy their meal, it is hard to avoid the smoke of the cigarettes.
If there are children in the restaurant, they could get the idea of mimicking like the person who is smoking. It can be a wrong model for the children who see. That is why smoking is not suitable for family-friendly restaurants where people with different ages come. 
In conclusion, not only smoking has a bad impact on the smoker himself but also to others around him. That's why I agree with the statement  Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country .
