I do not totally agree with smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant in the country but some of them must ban smoking inside. In my opinion, smoking that should be banned or not is based on what kind of restaurant is it. In the restaurants like bar or something that is aimed for young people, smoking should be allowed but in like which sell traditional curries and rice or somewhere the elder people dine in, it must be banned. There are some people who love to smoke but also there are some people who cannot stand the smell of smoking. For who love, it is a good thing but for who dislike, smoking is like an enemy that make them hard to breathe. Even though I am not a smoker, I can handle the smell of smoking when I am in bar or club. But I do not like it when I am in university canteen or in a restaurant which sells traditional curries and rice because at that time, smoking makes me feel uncomfortable and hard to breathes. Moreover, it makes me to get high temper and I becomes too sensitive for everything. That's why I do not totally agree with that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
