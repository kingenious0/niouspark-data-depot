I agree with the statement that it's important for college students to have a part time job. In these days, everything has become more and more expensive. The prices of the things keep going up although our incomes are not. There is an old Myanmar saying, 'we cannot buy wisdom with gold'. That was quite true back then. Nowadays, that saying would be a little bit irony for we live in a capitalistic society. Nothing is free anymore. We have to pay a decent amount of money to obtain a decent education in order to have a decent life. As we are students, it's important for us to have a stable education. Moreover, we have our own investments to be made beside educational purposes such as our hobby, donating to a charity and anything that we have to use our money. Making money as a college student isn't that easy as we have to study on the other hand. Hence, part-time jobs have become a resolution for those who want to make money without stopping the college. The wage of a part-time job isn't that much. But it's sufficient to fulfill a college student's financial concerns. As for me, I think it would be nice to make money during our study process. It has less working hours, worth paid and has many benefits. For example, we will be more familiar with the jobs and how they proceed. We can gain experiences and will able to solve our problems in the near future..
