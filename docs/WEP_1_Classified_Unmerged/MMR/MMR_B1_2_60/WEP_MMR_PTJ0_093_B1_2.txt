Yes, I strongly agree about with that. It is important because some country has a part time job for younger people. Some young people need a job for their financial,for example their college pay, their apartment rent, home condition, etc. Because of not having part time job some young people having trouble with college funds. In Myanmar many young people drop out of college after high school because they don't have any financial money for the university. And many students really suffering from it for not having part time job. And it is really sad for those who really want to attend college or university. And in some country the government support part time job for young people. And in that way it's really help for college students. Also it is really need to have a good salary too. That's why we need more part time job and to support college students to save money for their apartment rent, college funds and etc. We need more time to do part time job too because many of us are students who don't want to relay on our parents.
