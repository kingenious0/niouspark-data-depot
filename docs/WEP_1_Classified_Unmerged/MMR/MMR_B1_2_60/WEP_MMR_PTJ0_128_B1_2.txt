"Nowadays, students start seeking part-time jobs for different reasons, along with their studies. From my point of view, I strongly agree with the statement that students should have part-time jobs for many reasons.
The first reason is that they can get financial aid without asking their parents for pocket money. Then they will have a chance to buy their needs with their own money, and it may even reduce financial stress for poor parents.
For the second reason, they will understand the value of money and may also gain financial management skills as they have to deal with their own money.
For the third reason, they will improve time management skills as a result of dealing with work and school schedules.
The work area is more challenging than university. Then, students may have various kinds of problems and difficulties concerning both tasks and people. Therefore, they can enhance their problem-solving skills, communication skills, responsibility, and adaptability. Besides, they can have a chance to make their social circle bigger and make more friends.
As a fifth reason, they will become more independent and confident by joining a part-time job. They will know how much potential they have to maintain their life without the influence of their parents and relatives. This will help them lead their life better in the future.
Moreover, they will have enough work experience so that they don't have many difficulties when they are in their job fields after graduation.
Additionally, they can explore career options well as they will be knowledgeable about work and careers by joining a part-time job.
In conclusion, part-time jobs will let students have exposure to work life and the real world in advance. Hence, these are the reasons why I support the idea that students should have part-time jobs."
