 I disagree that it is important for college students to have a part time job only for Myanmar students but in other countries, a part time job is very important for college students who study in foreign or who work as a teenager for their family. A part time job can't be possible to work as a college student in Myanmar because our country is so bad at economic situation. So, the best way for the students who want to work as a part time job is that typing writer and study guide etc. In my opinion, the college students in Myanmar need to study indeed the respective subjects and fields to reach the end of their goals deals with education instead of finding a part time job.  Nowaday, many children and teenagers are losing their ambitions, goals and attitudes because of our country's poverty. Not only for students but also for the people in Myanmar 
In fact, no money is the main reason why the college students to have a part time job because of they needed deals with their stationaries and accessories but that is not the right way for them in our country. Myanmar students are truly need to have many knowledges about their subjects and future jobs and also need to be sure what they want to be in their life. I hope our country's economic plans will be fine not only for the people but also for the country's education. If the education in our country is gradually great, the college students in Myanmar will get the chances to study together with the students in other countries. And also as a college student to work a part time job in Myanmar or other countries. So, I disagree to have a part time job for college students cause of above my reasons.
