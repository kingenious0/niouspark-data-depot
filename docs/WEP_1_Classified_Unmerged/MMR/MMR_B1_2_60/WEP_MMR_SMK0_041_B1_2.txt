 

Smoking has become popular among young people.Nowadays,above 14 chidren are smoking.I agree Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaunts in the country.Second-hand Smoke is linked to symptoms of depression.
Children are at a higher risk of exposure to second-hand smoke, most of which comes from parents and other adults smoking at home. These children tend to get sick more often, are at a higher risk of developing lung infections (like bronchitis and pneumonia) and are more likely to have recurrent episodes of cough, wheezing and shortness of breath.
All these problems may seem small at first, but one cannot neglect with bigger ones associated with them. 
These would include the expenses incurred, the trips to the doctors, medicines, lost school time, parents having to stay back home to care for their sick child, let alone the discomfort the child has to go through.Smoking can harm health.Some people can't stand the smell of tobacco.It can destroy our liver and lungs. I am suffering from chronic lung disease from smoking.If it goes on for a long time, I can't breathe anymore.In the worst case, I can lose my life.If someone around you smokes, you have to tell them to stop smoking. So,smoking is destroyed our life and our health.We can avoid smoking
