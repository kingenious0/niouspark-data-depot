 In my personal point of view, it's important for college or university students to have part-time jobs. There are a lot of part-time jobs that university students can do, like babysitting, tutoring, writing, etc. For me, since I'm specialization major in university is English Literature, I prefer to work as a teacher or a tutor than other jobs. 

There are a lot of reasons why students want to work part time. And most of the time, it is because they want extra pocket money and experience. Being a student or a minor, we don't get a lot of money from our parents. And by working, we don't have to fully rely on our parents or our savings to be able to afford our essential needs or wants. Also, for the students that are shy or don't have a lot of confidence in communicating with strangers or people in general, working some part-time jobs can help them. And as they gain more confidence, they'll be more comfortable and confident within themselves. 

Lastly, working part-time jobs can help to improve our managing skills. It doesn't matter whether it is people or money or time. Since we are university students, we have to attend classes too. So we would have to balance working and studying equally and this can help enhance our skills. To conclude, I agree with the fact that university students should work part-time jobs, since it can provide us with the skills that we would need throughout our lives.
