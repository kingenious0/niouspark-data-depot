 I used to think that part-time jobs are not necessary for teenagers because my mother told me that you do not need a job while you were studying. She used to say that you could ask money when you needed. However, as a university student, I found out a fun fact that mom could also be wrong. From my own experiences, I absolutely know that having a part-time job is necessary for college students.
There are several advantages for having a part-time job as a university student. Firstly, money that we earned from part-time job can help to solve our financial problems. I am sure that you know very well how much expenses university students, especially for who live in dormitory, have. Part-time jobs can reduce the amount of money that we ask from our family or we can also buy some things on our own with that money. 
Then, it can also help us to improve our time management skills, which are vital in our future career, because you need to balance time between work and classes. Thirdly, we can also get work experiences which are the favourite things of CEOs in Myanmar. At last, but not the least, we can also get connections fortunately if we get friends who are seniors in our fields. We can even get some job opportunities from them. However, I think we should choose one which is flexible for our colleges or universities.
I think I have mentioned some strong points for my opinion and I hope that you get it. According to the benefits that I have mentioned, I firmly say that it is very important to have part-time jobs as a college student.
