"Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It not only harms the one who smokes but also affects the people around him/her. Since restaurants are mostly buildings, if one person smokes, it will surely spread around the building and will reach nearly everyone inside, which is all the more reason to ban smoking inside the restaurants. 

It is generally known that Nicotine can cause lung cancer if a person smokes too much. However, people smoke either because they are addicted to it or they want to look so-called attractive and fashionable. Nowadays, E-cigarettes have been widely spread over the world and most youngsters and adults buy them. Due to their compact and modernizing design, people were tempted more than ever. However, smoking inside the restaurants is the most unethical behaviour and should be prohibited by the owners. Or the alternative is they can build a smoking area where people can smoke. By doing so, it will not harm the people around them and at the same time, the owners will not lose the customers who smoke. 

In fact, smoking can cause harm to the human body and make nuisance to the people in the vicinity. So it would be better if we can create a Nicotine free world.
