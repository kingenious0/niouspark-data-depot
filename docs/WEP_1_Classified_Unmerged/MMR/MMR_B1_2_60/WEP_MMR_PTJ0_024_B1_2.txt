                   I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. In my opinion, people should start to learn what a workplace is like and how to manage their time and money in their teenage years. Having a part-time job is a way to do so. In this essay, I will be stating why it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
   	Firstly, if you have a part-time job, you will make some extra money to live off apart from the allowance given by your parents. Attending college is very expensive: you have to pay textbooks fees, transportation fees, dormitory fees if you live away from your college and so on. As a college student, I can surely say that it is hard to cover all the expenses only with the monthly allowance. But with the wage from a part-time job, you will be able to cover all expenses and may even be left with some extra perks. Secondly, we will have a chance to step into the real world. Most Burmese teenagers are very dependent on their family. But once you get a part-time job, no matter what kind of job it is, you will have to interact with people from different backgrounds and will have a chance to learn from them. 
       	Moreover, it is not easy to get a part-time job in Myanmar unless you live in an economically developed city like Yangon. However, there are plenty of part-time jobs opportunities online and it is not difficult for you to land a decent one if you choose wisely. To sum up, doing part-time jobs is a way to enhance your interpersonal skills and get some allowance. Therefore, I think college students should really consider having a part-time job.
