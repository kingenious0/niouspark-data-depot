 T﻿he dangers of smoking are well documented and protecting the health and well-being of people in our society is a top priority. The complete ban on smoking in all restaurants in our country is a necessary measure not only to protect public health, but also to create a clean and warm environment for all customers. 
First, banning smoking in restaurants will reduce the risk of smoking. Many studies have linked smoking to many life-threatening diseases, including cancer, heart disease, and respiratory disease. By eliminating smoking in restaurants, we can protect the health of smokers and nonsmokers, reduce their exposure to smoke, and reduce the number of smokers. 
Second, the implementation of a smoking ban in restaurants will create a more enjoyable and inclusive dining experience. Non-smokers often experience discomfort, and even disgust when exposed to secondhand smoke while eating. By providing a non-smoking environment, restaurants can meet the needs of all customers, including families, people with respiratory problems, and those who just want to focus on non-smoking food. This provides a more enjoyable environment where everyone can dine and be friends without being bothered by the smoke. 

Also, all smoking bans in restaurants are in line with the global movement to create a healthy and clean public environment.  The fact that 
restaurants are completely smoke-free is an important step towards protecting public health and providing a welcoming environment for all customers. By eliminating the health risks associated with second-hand smoke and creating a smoke-free environment, we can improve people's health and support the health of drinking communities. Lawmakers should recognize the importance of banning smoking in restaurants for the health and comfort of all citizens.
