"      Myanmar is being influenced by the cultures and habits of the Western countries. Calling employees for part-time job and doing part-time job in Myanmar was not popular many years ago. As a Myanmar citizen, I had seen doing part-time job only in other countries' movies and dramas. However, almost every people including college students in Myanmar love to do part-time job not only outside but also on online in modern days as soon as Myanmar is being developed. Hence, I suppose it is essential for college students to have a part-time job.
      In Myanmar, most elderly misunderstand that part-time jobs are just cashiers, dish-washers and waiters at the restaurants and convenience stores. As soon as technology is being developed, there are many effective part-time jobs that most college students need that kind of experiences such as translators, interpreters, part-time teachers, freelancers, content writers and so on. That's why there are variety of advantages that part-time jobs give to the college students. Firstly, time management skill will be improved, which is one of the important skills that college students need to have. Everything depends on this skill and they need to calculate their time not to affect their college students' lives. Secondly, doing part-time jobs can give a lot of wonderful experiences that can be reused at their workplace after they graduated because most companies like to call the new employees who have two or three years' working experience in their related fields. Last but not least, their parents do not have to fully give financial support and this is indirectly repaying parents gratitude by making them not to be tired.
    To sum up, if a student who is enthusiastic and has a strong willing to achieve many sliccesses in his/her future, part-time jobs can give the steps to achieve it."
