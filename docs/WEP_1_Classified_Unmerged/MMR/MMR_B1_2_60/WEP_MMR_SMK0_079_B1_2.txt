           Smoking is bad for your health. No matter what type of smoking you does, the fact that it is harmful to your body doesn't change. The chemical compounds might be different but it is harmful nonetheless. Moreover, it is harmful to the environment as a whole.
          One of the reasons people should avoid smoking in a public area such as restaurant is the smell. When a cigarette is lighted on fire, a smoke is released accompanied by an unpleasant smell due to the chemicals involved. Some people just can't stand the smell of the smoke and might get bothered by it. If the restaurant arranged the seats tightly because of the cramped space, then you'll be bothering everyone. You should not smoke because the space is shared with everyone and you do not own the space.
          Secondly, people should avoid smoking due to the smoke released. The cigarette's smoke is harmful to human's body. Some chemicals involving in making cigarettes are harmful that when the smoke got in contact with the human's body, it causes reactions such as sneezing, coughing and watery eyes. You might get away with light symptoms but over long period of exposure, more serious health issues will arise. You should not smoke in a public place causing other people harms.
          Overall, smoking should not be allowed in all public areas. People should make an area designated to smoke like the rooftop for dispersing the smoke more effectively or a room with excellent ventilation.
