  I do agree that mentioned statement . Smoking must be banned at restaurants. It can make unpleasant situations to the customers within a circle who is smoking nearby. It can also brings lungs-related diseases and some disfects to the people who inhale those tobacco smokes. I really really think this should really banned.And also when the elderly person sitting in a restaurant; it is also rude to smoking beside of him or her beacuse its just so rude kike mannerless. And also smoking not only must be banned at the restaurant but also at the public entertainment places like playground where kids are playing and relaxing. I dont say to break this smoking habit ; its just you can do this at somewhere not too crowded or the places or where you might not see other people around. I dont why people like to smoke but i really dont like smoking.They would be like this is the life you have to live with it but this is just so wrong Am I right.And Also i really dont recommend to smoke it is not good.In my opinion if u want to smoke you can ; but not too much till leading into some dangerous health hazards.if i mentioned too much you would be like youre not my father and youre not my parents so yeah we do have youth rights to do.But its just right and wrong so decide on your own.But i really do agree with the mentioned statement.
