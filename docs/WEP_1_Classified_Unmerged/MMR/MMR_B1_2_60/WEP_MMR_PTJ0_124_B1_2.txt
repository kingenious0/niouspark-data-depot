"As everyone comes from different roots, the way life treats a person cannot be the same. So that, the fact that whether a part-time job is important for a student or not can differ from each student. Students who come from weak background will desperately need a part-time job where students who come from a well-off family might think it as a wasteful of time. Besides, though their parents can support, there are also some students who want to depend on themselves. For me, I think it's very important for a student to have a part-time job. As my mom is a nurse and she has to support 3 children, it is not easy to make ends meet. So in order to share some of the burden my mom has been carrying, I have to search for a part-time job which is really hard to find in Myanmar. Most of the job descriptions include "" must be a graduate"", ' must have 3 or 4 years of experience ' etc and basic job like a cashier, waiters are not paid well enough. I believe by doing a part-time job, it can somehow add the sense of responsibility of their own life to the students. They can even get job experience even before they graduate so that when they finally enter the industry, they already possessed strength and knowledge how to overcome and be familiar with the working process. Moreover, coping between class and part-time job can build mental strength and improve personal skill. All in all, whether you are rich or not, a student should have a least one experience of having a part-time job where they could learn a great deal about life. And I hope someday in the future, young people in Myanmar would be offered many opportunities and choices.
