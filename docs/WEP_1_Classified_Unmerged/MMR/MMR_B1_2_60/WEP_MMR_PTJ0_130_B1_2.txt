"As the world today is developing day by day, we can say that money is the second God for human beings. In fact, our living costs are rising and we, as youths, need more money for our abilities, happiness, and education. So we should have part-time jobs while we're going to a college. Therefore, I agree the above statement.

Firstly, we must work to help our parents. Going a college can cost a lot of money. When we go to a school, we need to pay a lot such as entrance fees, accommodation fees, book fees, social-activities fees, and living costs. It is very unfair to let our parents pay all of the fees. We should try to pay half of the fees at least with our own incomes. Second, we can have enough working experiences in advance before graduation by working part-time jobs. This will be totally helpful in our future real-life working fields. Third, by working part-time jobs, we can spend our own money as we wish. Being a youth has a lot of needs and challenges especially money problems. As youths, we want to spend money a lot for our happiness. So it is more ecstatic using our own money than our gurdians' money for superficial things.  

However, in our country, there are rare part-time jobs for students. Students in our country face a problem of  not having enough money in university life. I hope the employers in our country to give some part-time jobs to college students to be easier for their college life. I, being a college student in Myanmar, also wish to have a part-time job to earn money for my own use. So I strongly agree the statement, "It's important for college students to have a part-time job".
