 In this case, I agree with the given statement. A part-time job is recommended for college or university students. Working part-time jobs can assist them in numerous ways. 

Students can work part-time jobs and still study, which is excellent. Since many part-time jobs only demand the worker to put in three or four hours a day, students are able to divide their time between a job and study since, unlike high schools, colleges and universities  have some more free time to do part time job.

Everyone who is a parent wants the best for their kids, including the greatest possible teachers, employment, and educational opportunities for a bright future. But regrettably, some parents cannot afford the costs of a cities lifestyle while their children attend a top university. Students may pursue part-time jobs for additional income to address this issue. Their part-time job salaries can pay their monthly expenses if they manage their money well. even though they don't need extra money, privileged students whose parents can afford the costs of attending a good college or university should work as employees in part-time jobs because doing so will teach them modesty and provide them with experience that will be valuable for later in life permanent jobs.
