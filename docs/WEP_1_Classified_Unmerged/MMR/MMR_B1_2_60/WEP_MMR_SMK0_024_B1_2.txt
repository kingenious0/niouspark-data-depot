             Smoking is a very popular activity all around the world. People smoke in any place at any time. Smoking does no good to the smokers regardless of where and when they smoke. However, the severance of the effect can differ depending on where you do it and I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country for the reasons below.

             Firstly, we all know that smoking has negative effects on both the smoker and the person nearby. In a restaurant, people sit next to one another and the tables are placed closely to each other. If one person smokes, the smoke from the cigarette travels across the tables and pollutes the whole room damaging the lung of not only the smoker but also anyone who inhales it. Secondly, some restaurants have special air conditioning rooms and of course, in such kind of rooms, the smoke lingers longer and hypothetically, worsen your health even more. Moreover, restaurant is a place where people of different ages come and have their meals. Those people also include young kids who are very impressionable. By seeing an adult smoking, they might get an inspiration to try it out by themselves. In Myanmar, we even have this saying that says that smoking is the primary cause of many youths trying out weed and different kinds of drugs.

             Lastly, smoking is one of those activities that people pay to jeopardize their health. Doing it in the restaurants can do harm not only to the smoker himself but also to a lot of other people in the restaurant. Moreover, it can also give the kids the wrong idea that it is healthy or cool to smoke. Therefore, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
