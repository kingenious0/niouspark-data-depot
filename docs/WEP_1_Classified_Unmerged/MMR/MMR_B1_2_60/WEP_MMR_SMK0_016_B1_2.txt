     All kinds of people go to restaurants. Whether with family, friends, or even alone, we have all been to restaurants. We can freely act in a restaurant, and out of all the activities you can do in a restaurant, we are going to discuss about smoking. Should smoking be banned in restaurants? What about in the country as a whole?
  First of all, smoking is bad not only for smokers but also for the people around them, as they also inhale the smoke. This is especially true in a restaurant where people of all ages gather, including young and elderly. Their lungs are weak, and inhaling a certain amount of smoke can affect their health badly. Secondly, smoking also affects women's beauty. In beauty commercials, it is often stated that smoke causes acne. Lastly, and most importantly, it can distract consumers from enjoying their meals.
    If we look at things from the smoker's perspective, there's no loss for them. They can easily smoke in smoking areas or at home. We are not judging what they enjoy doing, but smokers should also consider public health.
    As someone who coughs constantly when inhaling smoke, my opinion is clear. I agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants throughout the country. Starting with restaurants, I hope that one day public can enjoy their day without dealing with smoke.
