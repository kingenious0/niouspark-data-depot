I agree that smoking should be entirely prohibited in all restaurants in the country.  First and foremost, smoking is a serious health danger for both smokers and non-smokers. People who stay near smokers will absorb the poisonous compounds and carcinogens found in secondhand smoke, which can cause a number of health problems such as lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory disorders. Moreover, a ban on smoking in restaurants would be consistent with worldwide attempts to reduce tobacco use and the prevention of smoking-related illnesses. Research highlighted that if  smoking rates significantly decline, and public health outcomes will improve.The restaurant sector would benefit economically from a smoke-free dining atmosphere. Besides, the health of the workforce would also advance, increasing productivity and lowering sick leave.Additionally, smoking is not beneficial to the surroundings. Tobacco smoke pollutes the environment and has numerous negative consequences on the forest, including deforestation and wood burning. Finally, it could be harmful to the human race.There are numerous justifications why smoking ought to be prohibited in all restaurants. An area where people socialize and spend time together is a restaurant. I think, families shouldn't go to a restaurant where smoking is allowed, especially, no parent will be happy if their kids see smokers and imitate that habit.  In  short , even those who do not smoke but are close to a smoking environment will experience health issues.  So, I do believe that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country.
