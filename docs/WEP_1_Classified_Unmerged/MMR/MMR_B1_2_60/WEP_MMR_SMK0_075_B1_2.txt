Humans are stubborn. Although we know smoking is bad, we cannot give it up. The number of deaths caused by smoking or by the diseases associated with smoking has not reduced. Smoking not only harms the person who smokes but also his surroundings. At least, it makes uncomfortable to the person who inhales the smoke. Also, smoking in public areas is extremely rude. There might be a pregnant woman, an old person or a month-old baby. And they are likely to suffer from the smoking indirectly. Smoking in a restaurant is a common case throughout the world. However, restaurant also is a public place that anyone and everyone can enjoy. Some restaurants prohibited smoking but many are not. I think if we can ban smoking in restaurants, we can reduce the rate of diseases caused by smoking, especially for passive smokers. But that will not be an easy journey. Because some think smoking is their individual choice and they tend to claim their rights. So, instead of banning smoking in restaurants, making  a smoking area would make more convenient for both parties. In fact, we should ban smoking in every public areas including schools, bus stops, cinemas and shops. Therefore, I must say I agree the statement that smoking should be completely banned in restaurants.
