In the western world, parents let their children learn to live independently.  However, in Asia, parents provide for their children until they find employment. I believe that students who have reached adulthood like college students  should be expected to take their financial responsibility.
     Being responsible is essential for success.   Being a western culture, they believed that children who are college students should be responsible and independent.  So they let their children go to live independently.  Working a part-time job while in college is a great idea.  From such kind of employment, they will learn a lot of experiences and lessons.  When they interact with the people, they will learn more about them. They'll be more courageous and persistent. And when they have a part-time job, they will understand the value of money. Even those who are 80 years old work a part-time job in the western world.  They believe that all they need to do is keep moving. However, in Asia, parents were not allowed to let the children live alone.    They allowed the children  even their children are college students to stay with them together  in order to prevent children from any harm or danger. So the children cannot learn what duty is.  But I'd rather not put the blame on them.  And that's not their fault either.  But I think college students should take their own responsibility and they ought to work part time job.      So that they will be independent financially.
