"I agree that part-time job is important for college students. Being college students, we are learning new knowledge in college or university so that we can apply in the outside when we work. Working a part-time job means to get experience in the job whether it is just a waiter or a driver for me. We can learn many new things from doing a part-time job. We have to meet new and different kind of people so that we can learn a lot about people which will help us in our real job when we finish our college or university. In other countries such as America and Europe, there are many students who work part-time jobs when they reach 18 years old. I love that habit. We can learn about life from doing that. We as a student in Myanmar, we always do everything with our parents. We do not know about life much. So I believe that doing a part-time job will help us to know more about everything that we do not know or learn before. On the other hands, we can earn our own money so that we can buy everything what we need without requesting our parents and it is also a thing that we help our parents as a part. So I believe that doing a part-time job is very good for college students.
