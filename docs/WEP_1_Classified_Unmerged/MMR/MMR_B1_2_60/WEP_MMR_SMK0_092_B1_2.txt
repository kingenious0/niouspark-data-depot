I agree with the fact because smoking can lead to many health related problems.They can also harm others nearby.So,in restaurants,there are many people who are eating and its really rude to smoke while the others are eating.Smoking should be banned at all the restaurants because smoking can make the people who inhale the smoke cause more effects than the user.It can make the people around them feel worse and make the atmosphere of the restaurant dimmer.If there are children or old people nearby,it'd cause them serious health problems and diseases.Smoking should be also restricted in other public areas which are crowded with people.So I think smoking must be banned in all restaurants around the world.Moreover,smoking can only give the user very bad diseases and not a single good thing included.Hence,smoking must be banned in my opinion.Smoking can cause various lungs related disease and it can harm the lung very badly.Furthermore,there is no cure for lungs cancer caused by smoking.For me,I dislike smoking because it can harm the environment.
