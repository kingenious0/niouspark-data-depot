I strongly agree with this fact. Because I am also a college student who demand a lot of money all the time. Even my family can provide me enough money, I still want to spend more on my own. So, part-time jobs are the best solution for the college  students who want to spend money on their own but don't want to ask money from parents all the time. As the other teenagers, we want to keep up with the trends, the current of fashion nowadays and want to go adventures at the best time of our life. In Myanmar, there are not a lot part-time jobs that are suitable with the college students because of their lecture times in college. I hope the government could  create a lot of job perspectives for college students. That will help most of the students came from middle-class families. That will also help the students' mentality when they enter the business industry after the graduation. So, part-time jobs are the best for the most of the college students for many reasons.
