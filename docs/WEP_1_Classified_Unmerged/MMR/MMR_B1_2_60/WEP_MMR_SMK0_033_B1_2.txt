I agree that smoking should be completely banned at the restaurants in the country because of the people's heath. In many countries, the teenagers really love to smoke not only in the restaurants but also in every where like on the streets,on the bus,on the train and also the public area. That habits are very bad for children and patients in public area. For example, especially in the restaurants,the teenagers and some men are smoking like not having control while they meet with their friends and together with their families that is why the people were bad at their health deals with their respiratory system and they gradually may be cough loudly because of smoking.Since we were in primary schools,we learned about the knowledge of smoking which showed the patients who feel pain because of the smoking but nowadays, the cigarettes can be got at every shopping malls and markets.As I know about the thing like the cigarette is the vape which is so popular among teenagers. They think that the vape gives us the happiness while they depressed and lonely. They are so addicted in smoking with above things not knowing it can hurt their health and it can also be ruin thier life. As the teenagers' parents, they should be tell the knowledge and the bad things about smoking to their children but some parents used to smoke since they were adult.The adults and the teenagers should listen the advices from their parents and teachers.So, also the restaurants'owner must be control the customers who are smoking in public area and between the other customers. In my opinion,that behaviors can be distrust to the customers of restaurants if the owners freely give a permission to smoke.
