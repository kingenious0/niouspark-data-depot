I agree with that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. As a college student, I want some challenges like doing part-time job before being a permanent employer. I really want to experience like this. Another is that we can earn extra money by doing part-time job. As for me, I am 22 years old and I don't want to ask for pocket money form my family and I want to do something that I can get money in a good way. I assume that if I got part-time jobs, I do not have to feel sorry for asking money from my parents. I feel guilty to asking for pocket money. I just want to find my own many and to spend it without hesitation. Moreover, if I have one or more part time jobs, I will have work experiences and will know how to communicate with people more. Once my mother told me that I will not appreciate money and will not know how difficult finding money is. So, I'm so sure that I will not spend my own money on unnecessary things if I got my money from doing a part-time job. In my opinion, doing part-time job is a big chance for the ones who cannot afford to attend colleges or universities or courses. Thus, I totally agree with the idea that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
