     For me,I'm also a university student and I think part-time job is necessary for students.There's alot of part-time jobs that university students can do, like tutoring,sale stuff in mini markets,writing,etc.I usually work in hotal as a F&B stuff in weekends.

Students want to work part-time job for many reasons.Permanent jobs takes lot of time for student and if you work permanent job,you can't go to school.That's why part-time job is very suitable for students.Even you get a little pocket money,with part-time job,you will get extra money from it.Not to think that part-time job give only give extra money,it's also gives work experience and you will know how precious the money that's make by your own effort.And you will learn about the people and life lessons.You will have lots of confidence in communication with the people you have never seen and you won't shy anymore in communication with strangers.

Part-time job can help to improve our communication skills and managing skills in college and university.And we don't need to search for work experience seriously.It doesn't matter what's kind of job it is,you will learn how to communicate with others and how to solve the problems.Sometimes you have to speak with the foreigners in your jobs. At  these time,you will get experience of speaking with foreigners.As I'm a university student and I need that kind of experience.By working part time job help me to balance between working and studying equally and it can help enhance our skills.For conclusion,I strongly agreed the fact that the university students should work part-time jobs that can provide with the skills that we would need throughout our lives.
