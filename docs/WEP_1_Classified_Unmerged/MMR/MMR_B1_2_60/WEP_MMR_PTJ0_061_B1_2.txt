Nowadays, as the world is progressing day by day, the global living standards become higher and the needs of materialism by people's civilizations have also rise. As a result, the prices of our global materials and the basic requirements for every sort of things like phones, laptops, clothes etc. have become more expensive all over the world. Thus, there's no person in the 21th Centuries who doesn't need to find their way to find money for driving their own life as we live in a capitalistic community. Every person in the world has to rely on himself. Even the children of the ants, one of the smallest animals, drive their own lives by taking their responsibilites respectively. So why can't people be? Therefore I agree with the fact that it's important for college students to have a part-time job. But mostly, the college students are under 20, so they have little experiences in touching with the outside world. They might find it quite difficult in earning money because making money is a really uneasy thing as a student where they have very little in experiences and have no graduations at all . There might be many opportunities and job prospects for them but they have to study on the other hand as the educational stability is more important, I think. They should be more focus on their studies so they can make money freely without being anxious after they have graduated. For those, who have difficulties in financials,there are many programs for scholarships so they can apply scholar by studying regularly without doing any outside part-time jobs for financial concerns.
