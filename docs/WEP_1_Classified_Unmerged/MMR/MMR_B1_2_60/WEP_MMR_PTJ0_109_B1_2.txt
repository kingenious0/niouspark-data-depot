"    It is important for college students to have a part-time job. Part-time jobs provide the necessary
income to the students whose financial background is low as well as the extra income to the students who want to spend on the things they want to buy or eat. 
    I believe many college students have part-time jobs in order not to burden the family and to stand on their own feet independently. This not only grants them the income but also strengthens their minds to become mature people. By earning money on their own, they come to know the value of a single penny and the effort necessary to put in and ultimately, they can sympathize with their parents who are financially supporting them up until now. A person who knows the value of the money will not recklessly waste it and will learn to use it in the controlled manner. Besides, work life can give us invaluable experiences and moral lessons.
     Overall, I believe having a part-time job can give us more than financial support. It can make us see the world we have not seen before and can shape us to become a good person who is dependable for their own family.
