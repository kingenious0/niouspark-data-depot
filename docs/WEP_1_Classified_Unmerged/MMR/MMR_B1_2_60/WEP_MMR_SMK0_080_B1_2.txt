       It is true that smoking is such a bad habit but, smoking can also be an activity that helps people get away from their stress, anxiety, depression or loneliness. Some people use smoking to escape from their ugly society. There can be some times that people need to smoke to help them get better. For such times, they'll need a space where they are allowed to smoke. Moreover, all adults have their own rights to smoke and they should be able to smoke at places where they want to. If smoking were completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, there would be more people smoking in the streets and other public places. There can be people smoking carelessly near hospitals, schools or other inappropriate places for smoking. It can harm other innocent people more than smoking in a restaurant. Instead of banning them completely, creating a certain area for smoking in a restaurant would be better for both smoking and non-smoking people.
       As a conclusion, people should be able to smoke where they want to unless it is inappropriate.   Therefore, I disagree with that fact that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
