 I hate cigarettes and the adverse consequences of secondhand smoke may be felt by surrounding non-smokers. For that reason, I would stay away from restaurants that permitted smoking. My uncle used to smoke as well when he was younger. He smokes at home, but I've never liked being around people who smoke. Smoking is a bad habit that not only harms the smoker but also those who are around them. Given that they are public areas, restaurants should be smoke-free to protect public health.Lung cancer, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases are just a few of the health issues brought on by smoking. These health problems can also be caused by secondhand smoke, which nonsmokers can also inhale.Therefore, in my opinion, a smoking restriction in restaurants could make the environment more welcoming and pleasurable for everyone. The freedom of smokers to smoke where they like may be defended by some, however this argument disregards the right of nonsmokers to inhale clean air. Additionally, smokers are still permitted to consume cigarettes outdoors should they so desire. Personally, I also experience a great sense of happiness whenever I visit a restaurant with a non-smoking sign. In conclusion, in order to enhance public health and the eating experience, smoking should be entirely prohibited in all restaurants throughout the nation.
