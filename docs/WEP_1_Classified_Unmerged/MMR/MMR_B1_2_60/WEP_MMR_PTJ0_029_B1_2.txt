Being an adult can make you cost more because you have to buy something that you need and want. If you are a boy or girl, whatever, you have to buy clothes, technological devices, cosmetics and something what you want to eat. In order to solve this problems, we, college students must have a part-time job. The older you become, the more difficult to ask for some money from your parents or elders. According to my personal feelings, I become timid and feel guilty whenever I ask for money from my mother. Additionally, having a part-time job for teenagers not only make you earn money but also expand your community and develop your personal skills. It doesn't make sense that as we get older, we cannot depend or rely on our parents for the whole life instead of believing yourself and becoming independent. Let's compare to the person who makes money on their own way and the one who is still asking for money. The former one will realize how tough and hard to earn money and also will know how to approach strangers. Moreover, if we do something or working, our mind will not spread through the universe, will focus on our own business and obey to our seniors. In this way, we may become obedient, patient, punctual and organizing person. According to not only about the previous facts but also other many benefits, it is important to have a part-time job for college students.
