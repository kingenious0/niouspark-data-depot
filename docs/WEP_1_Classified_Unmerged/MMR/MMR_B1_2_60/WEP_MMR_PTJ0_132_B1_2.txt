Part-time jobs are really necessary for college students. As a college student, we need to learn about real world and part-time jobs are great opportunities for it. If we can earn some money for our study, our parents will be more comfortable to support us. Moreover, we can make new friends and new people at the job. And then, we can get much connection which can help us to build a strong community for our future. Therefore, in my point of view, I strongly agree that part-time jobs are important for college students. But on the other hands, especially aisan parents have much concern of letting their children for doing part-time jobs.They worried about their children and they do not want them to be tired and struggle between academic and money. According to my situation, when I ask my parents to let me do part-time job and study at the same time, I can see they have so much worries and concern and they forget that we are not children anymore and we need to learn about real world before graduation. However, at the end , they let me for doing part-time job and study at the same time. That job teaches me a lot and I became even more mature. Therefore, there should be many part-time jobs for college students.
