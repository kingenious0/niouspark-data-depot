 We, human beings do everything that takes to keep ourselves fit as the saying goes, ''The health is wealth.'' However, some of us make mistakes which can break down the health, like smoking, drinking and doing drugs. The most common one is smoking. I am personally tired of being a passive smoker.
Smoking is really a bad habit but I have no idea why people thinks that smoking looks cool. Moreover, nowadays people invented electric cigarette to reduce the smoking addiction. But it is still doesn't work. The amount of people who smoke is increasing day by day, even a lot of young women don't even shame to smoke in public. As the one who hate smoking, the restaurant are the places where the massive amount of people smoke. Even though, they all know the ingredients of the cigarette can affect the lungs.
Restaurants had to be for only dinning peacefully without any distraction. There may be minors in the restaurants. It is considered as a rude manner if the behaviors are negatively influenced on other people even though smokers don't have any bad intentions.
In my opinion, parents should educate their children about how bad the smoking is before they become adolescences. The number of stores that sell cigarette should be limited like letting open only the permitted ones. For example, the shopkeepers should check they customer's age as they must not sell to the restricted minors.
One more thing to add on, smoking does not only affect the one who smokes but also the ones in its vicinity. So, why can't people quit smoking since it doesn't bring any benefits for every single people on earth. Therefore, I strongly agree that the smoking should not be allowed in the restaurants all over the world.
