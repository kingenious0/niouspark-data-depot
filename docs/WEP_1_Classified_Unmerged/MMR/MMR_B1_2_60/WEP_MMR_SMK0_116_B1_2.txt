I disagree with this fact. Because this is against our human right in my opinion. Even though smoking is a bad habit for both for the smoker and his environment, it is still an acceptable thing to do freely. It should be banned only in the restaurants with the air-conditioning rooms for the other people's emotions while enjoying their foods and drinks. But for the open type restaurants like tea shops and canteens, it is acceptable places for the smokers to smoke freely. But the smokers need to be well-minded not to smoke around children and pregnant women. So banning smoking in all restaurants should not be the fair thing to do but need to be in the right time and place. If the thing we do is not badly hurting and disturbing for the people directly, we have the right to do what we love and what we wish for. That's why I don't agree with this fact about banning smoking from all the restaurants.   We should create the environment that is good for all people.
