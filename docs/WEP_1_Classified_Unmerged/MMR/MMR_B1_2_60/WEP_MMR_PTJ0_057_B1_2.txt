 Some people believe that university students should have part-time jobs, whereas others think that it is a 
bad idea for a student to work. In my opinion, part-time job is a must for every student. Thus, I must agree with this topic. This essay will analyze the importance of having a part-time job for a student, giving some relevant reasons and examples.

Firstly, part-time jobs allow students to learn interpersonal skills such as communication, problem solving, and active listening. This is because one needs to practice these skills no matter which job he or she does. For example, if a student works as a shop assistant, he or she will have to interact with customers both verbally and nonverbally, handle the customers' complaints, and listen to customers' inquiries attentively.

Secondly, part-time jobs give students chances to learn about people and life. There is no job in which a person does not need to deal with people. In fact, dealing with different people from different backgrounds enables a student to witness lessons and experiences concerning with life. Additionally, part-time jobs can be a financial resource for most students. They may earn some amount of money and invest it in their further education. Consequently, they will become financially independent. As soon as they have become financially independent, they will gain self-confidence and passion in whatever they do as well. This is one of the inevitable and undoubtable advantages of having a part-time job.

To conclude, part-time jobs grant a student opportunities to learn soft skills, encounter life experiences, and be confident and enthusiastic in their life. For the reasons I have mentioned, I strongly agree with the topic.
