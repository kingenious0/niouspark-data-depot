 I agree with the fact that smoking should be  completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking is not a good behavior for the public Smoking has a lot of disadvantages. The ingredients included in cigarettes are chemicals and toxic to our bodies. Smoking can make you feel pleasure. But, if you smoke long-term, you can have diseases related to the lungs and throat. For example, lung cancer, throat cancer, heart stock, rapid heartbeat, etc. Smoking is very dangerous for pregnant women. If she inhales toxic gas, the chemicals also affect her baby too. And when she breastfeeds her baby, the chemicals and diseases go to her baby through breast milk. It can happen baby to 
respiratory problems, diarrhea, and also cancer. I saw the video about how smoking affects your body. In this video, your lungs become black and dry because of the toxic gas.  So, smoking is bad for our bodies. Smoking disorders can also affect another person who doesn't smoke but inhale smoke from cigarettes. That is why smoking is banned in public places. In our country, a lot of people smoke in restaurants. It is very unpleasant for another customer who doesn't smoke. Especially for children and older people. Above facts, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country or set a private room in all restaurants only for smoking like in an airport.
