"Smoking is bad for health and it harms not only to a person who smokes but also people surrounding him. I saw many people who smoke in restaurants or public places. I think we should not ban smoking in restaurants as it is a person's privacy and their choice. We can be whoever we want. So I think we should make a smoking room in public areas so that it will be better for everyone. I saw smoking rooms in other countries which are in the restaurants or cafe shops. In many offices, there are specific smoking rooms for smokers. Smoking harms a person who stays near a person who smokes more. As it is bad for health, we cannot ban it  because it is their choice and their favourite. We as a human, there are so many things that we enjoy which some of them may seem weird for other people. So we have to find a solution that will not harm for the smokers and other people. Having a specific smoking room is a simple solution for this problem. So I believe that it will be better for making smoking rooms for people who smoke instead of banning smoking in the public areas.
