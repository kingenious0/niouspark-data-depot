"Many people regard smoking as an unhealthy habit but, there're still some who enjoy smoking. So, there's been an argument for and against that smoking should be banned completely at all restaurants. In my opinion, I think we should provide a specific place in a restaurant for those who smoke.

Firstly, Smoking not only affects the smoker's health but also the health of people near him and his family. It isn't unfair for other people to suffer from the risk of diseases since they're not the one who smoke. Secondly, most restaurants are operated with air-conditioners. It would be annoying and uncomfortable for other customers due to smoke. Moreover, there can be customers with asthma or young children. It can be dangerous for them if we let people smoke freely in a restaurant. 

On the other hand, we can't entirely prohibit people from smoking because it's their human right. They have their own right to do what they like to do. Therefore, instead of completely banning smoking, we should consider providing a place for them to smoke freely without interrupting other customers in restaurants.

In my opinion, the government is also responsible for keeping the citizens' health and should help to provide some solutions concerned with smoking instead of entirely banning it"
