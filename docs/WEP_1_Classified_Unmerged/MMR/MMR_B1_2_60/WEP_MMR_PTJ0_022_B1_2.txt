 In my opinion,college students in their 20s should have their own income.Since kindergarten,parents cost a lot on their children with school fee,clothes,foods,etc. If parents only support their children until high school, I think they have done their obligation.
      The age of college students are not very young and they become adulthood.So,they should not depend on their parents anymore and should make their own income by doing part time job.
      The reason to have a part time job for many students is to make some money.By working,they do not need to worry about finance too much and they can pay for school fee,rent,stationery or other stuffs by their own salary.
      Having a part time job gives not only money but also social skills.When we are working,we have to communicate with customers and be patient with them.We also work with on a team and staffs so we may have opportunities to meet new colleagues,mentors and even lifelong friends.It also gives good effect on our career after we graduate from college.
    So,college students having a part time job benefits in many ways according to these facts.That's why I agree with the statement  It is important for college students to have a part time job .
