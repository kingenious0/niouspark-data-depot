 As a university student, I personally think that having a part-time job is important.  There are many part-time jobs that a college or a university student can do such as a teaching guide, waiter, cashier, page admin etc. There are several reasons why part-time jobs are important for students of our age. 

Firstly, living expenses become more and more expensive the more we grow older. A person may need more things and wishes that he wants to get. However, in order to fulfil these requirements, we need money. For a person, who has a stable job, he may have money that he needs.But not students who are still under the control of parents; According to our country. Therefore, part-time jobs are the only way to get extra pocket money. Secondly, there are certain advantages that we can get from working part-time. One of them is experience. In addition, this experience can enhance your chance for future employment.

However, this can affect our study which may lead to failure in academics. Therefore, part-time jobs are more suitable for people with incredible management skills.
 
To conclude,  since there are more benefits than disadvantages, I strongly believe that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
