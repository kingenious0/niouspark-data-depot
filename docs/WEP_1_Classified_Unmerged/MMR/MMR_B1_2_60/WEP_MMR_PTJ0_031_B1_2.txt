For typical middle and upper-class Burmese parents, this topic is not something they would debate or discuss about. Most of them prefer not to see their college-student children work part-time jobs. Not because they don't want to see their children earning money or being independent, but only because they want them to fully concentrate on their education. Of course, their intentions are pure solely because they want the best for their kids but I think it is very important for college students to have a part-time job.
Speaking from the experiences of a spoilt kid myself who has never worked a single part-time job, I'm sure to admit that we lack many qualities that other students who have a part-time job have. Such qualities include having better communicative skills when associating with people, better time management, work ethic and etc. since they have to interact with different people. And it develops their skills to adapt the work struggles and the environment.
Those who have part-time jobs, moreover, learned how to value their money, for example; How to wisely use them, how to save them and how to not waste them on unnecessary things. It also says a lot when it comes to earning our own expenses, especially for those who attend college staying in a hostel because they pay for themselves while we have to ask our parents for financial assistance. Overall, they tend to know how to balance their student life and employer life, which is an essential quality needed throughout one's life.
Therefore, part-time jobs give college students, through their experiences, the opportunity to explore who they are and what they want to do with their life, which leads them to an affirming life.
