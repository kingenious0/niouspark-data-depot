                   Students are youths going to be adults in a matter of time. They shouldn't focus only on studying while depending on their parents. If they consider having a brighter future, Undergraduates need to be in touch with part-time jobs as a training period before they jump into full-time ones. Therefore, I firmly agree with this statement for the following reasons.
           A part-time job can give many benefits to students rather than workloads. Having Personal growth, financial independence, and self-confidence are included as one of the benefits. It is a golden opportunity to upgrade their essential skills outside the classroom. To use and compare theoretical knowledge in real life,  a student should have a job to get practical lessons rather than learning by heart. Some skills a student may gain are the value of time management, adaptability, responsibility, etc. 
           Advanced skills are the game changers in entering the professional world. How can a job provide a student with a better life? This question puts people in a confusional state. These days, we can't deny the fact that the cost of education is thriving. In the long run, it may also affect their academic progress.  To get out of the financial burdens, getting a part-time job is the answer to the question mentioned above. As it helps alleviate this burden by providing a steady income, reducing reliance on loans and parents, and gaining a sense of financial responsibility. From the occupations, students will get experiences. These experiences send them a sense of achievement and prepare tasks that college students will face.
           In conclusion, the significance of part-time jobs for college students cannot be overstated. Having a part-time job becomes the fundamental rule for every college student. Engagement in part-time employment will build a prosperous future ahead.
