 Smoking is one of the most common issues we had today that is killing people. The worst part of smoking is when a person smokes, they harm not only themselves but also others around them .Smoking cannot do any good thing and it only leads to bad health problems and death .So ,I agree that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country.
     Smoking should be prohibited in public places especially restaurants .People usually go to restaurants with their family .If someone smokes cigarettes there ,the health of people can be harmed by inhaling smoke especially old people ,young children or other unhealthy people .And parents do not want their children see  smoking in front of them cause they worry about their children would think smoking is a good thing and imitate them. Besides ,no one want to eat their meal with those smoke .Thus ,restaurant should respect to customers and ban smoking in these areas. If they do not ban completely ,there must have a smoking area in every restaurant.
     There is no good point in smoking .It can cause lung diseases and even cancer that can cause death in serious condition .Therefore ,I totally agree with that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
