   I do agree with this statement as I'm the student who's with a part time job. It's exhausting and stressful sometimes but I felt like I can bring my own income and Expenses without asking pocket money from my parents. It's great to be a Guide. Along with some stressful situations; it's somehow fun to do. And also we can buy snacks and making some activities with the budgets we got from our part-time job isnt it? I just feel alot of freedom when Im holding my own salary rather than the pocket money I got from my mother too. Its really important to have a part-time job for college students.I really agreed with this statement for sure and I also want you guys to fit this job ;It will be worth it I promise. Also Its okay to work any kind if part-time job you like. It can be teaching/Waiters or some other kinds of things you would like.Its not like relating with the hobby and it cant affect on your carrer youre doing too.For instance;if youre the student who studying under the department of law you can be a guide at your part time job Am I right?.Thats the thing I would like to say.Its okay to work while youre studying.it is exhausting but it is great and its worth it too...
