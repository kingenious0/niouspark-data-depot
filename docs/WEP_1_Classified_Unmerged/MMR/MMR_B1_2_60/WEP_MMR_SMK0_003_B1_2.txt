 
First of all, I have to introduce myself. I'm a student from Microbiology major first year second semester  at the University of Yangon.I want to talk about the topic   Smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country  .

You will notice that there are many people who smoke around you.You will see people dying from smoking.We don't know how many people die from smoking in the world .I don't think the number of deaths from smoking that we see is small . I would now like to say a few words about this smoking. Smoking is like breathing poison into lungs.It's like inviting lung cancer and other diseases.It can harm not only yourselves but also other people.Smoking is as addictive as alcohol.Smoking is very dangerous for young people.Smoking can lead young people down the wrong path.Young people can live full life only if they avoid smoking.Some restaurants sell cigarettes to underage people.This is behavior that humans should not do.There are a large number of restaurants in the country.So restaurants should ban smoking.

If only restaurants banned smoking, the smoking population could be significantly reduced.As the number of smokers decreases, the country can also benefit.Therefore, smoking should be strictly prohibited in restaurants.
