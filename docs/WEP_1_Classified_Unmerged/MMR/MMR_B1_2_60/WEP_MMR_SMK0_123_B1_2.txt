"     Smoking was very common many years ago and it is still trending in modern days. However, people from ancient era did not hesitate to smoke because the cigarettes from these days were made of leaves and plants so they could not be affect their health that much and they only smoked them for medicinal purposes. Unlike ancient era, today cigarettes are made of drugs, and chemical components that can completely affect the lungs of the consumers badly as well as the health of the surrounding people if they smell the smoke of the cigarette. Hence, most people can assume that I do not understand what human rights is as I totally agree that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country.
     Smoking seems to be a fashion in modern days and today people love to smoke not only to show off but also they are addicted to cigarettes even though they know that the ingredients included in cigarettes can make the consumers and the surrounding people unhealthy later. At worst, it can make the consumers die and the rest of the family members lose their beloved one because of these harmful cigarettes. Therefore, if the consumers are not addicted to cigarettes that much, they should try to quit smoking but if they are very addicted to cigarettes, they should try to smoke in private area such as smoking zone and not in the public area like restaurants. As a person who is keen on eating, I suppose smoking in the restaurants is a selfish behavior because not only the consumers at the restaurants are
distracted but also it is making everyone's health getting worse. 
      To be conclude, we can create the healthy world either banning smoking in all the public areas like restaurants or creating the smoking zones.
