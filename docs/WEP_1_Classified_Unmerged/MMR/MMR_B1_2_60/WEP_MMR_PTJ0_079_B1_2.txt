              Humans are adapting and evolving creatures driven by their curiosity of the world. Humans are weak compared to predators like lions or tigers but their wits and knowledge make up for the lack of raw strength. But their wits and knowledge does not come from nothing. An infant would be like a candle in the wind. Every youngling has to learn whether it is by sight or by ears. Younglings should be given a learning period.
          One of the disadvantages of college students working part-time jobs is that they don't get enough time to study. Even if they do, it would be a race against time. The lack of time becomes especially prominent in where the major subject the student studies is especially hard like bioengineering or biophysics or biochemistry. If the student takes away time for sleeping to study, the student's health will deteriorate thereby failing in both studies and performing badly in part-time job. 
          One thing the college students lost by working part-time is their social life. By investing their free time in part-time to earn more money, they tend to have very limited time to simply have fun with their friends. Late teenage and early twenties is the prime of a person's life. Youths should experience their firsts in everything like first love, first crime, first job and so on. Youths should experience their youth to its fullest not stuck in a coffee shop being a waiter.
          Part-time jobs take up too much time and with how tight a student's schedule is, the student is not getting any time enough to experience their youths to its fullest. It is not Important for students to have a part-time job.
