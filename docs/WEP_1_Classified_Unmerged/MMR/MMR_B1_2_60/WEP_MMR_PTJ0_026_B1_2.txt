 Having a part-time job for college students helps out to produce efficient and competent workers in the future. Besides, it can promote productivity in their daily life and ensures to value the time and money in their life. That is why, it is necessarily important for college students to have a part-time job in our country.
Surely, it can have them a new perspective on life-- they can seek more opportunities and they can gain more confidence as well as experiences through part-time job. Needless to say, this will carry them to an easier path when it comes to full-time job in the near future.
Comparing to other countries, our Myanmar country , significantly, cannot provide enough part-time jobs for college students. Understandably, it can have more jobless people in our country. Because of having a part-time job, no college students need to concern about their college fees, tuition fees, bus fare, and so on. This can be a relief for parents who try to make ends meet at the end of the day.
There are several reasons to point out the pros of having a part-time job. I, personally , think that this should be considered as an inspiration to produce the skillful adults in our community.
