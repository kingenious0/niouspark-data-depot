Every teenagers are usually reached at university. The most of students are between nineteen and twenty years old. So every student should go to the part-time job. In the between nineteen and twenty years, study the lesson and find a lot of money. In the morning if you go to the university,you will go to the part-time job in the evening.Sometimes you will tired and stressed but you will tried again. That you will tried again it guide for you in the future. Because you are older than now so  you will meet the reason of the people in the future. So we are already the problems in the future that are business, political,have  a lot of problems ,etc.If I do work a part-time job, I don't work very tired where.I work at the part-time jobs that are cafe shops,shopping malls, tourist guides, twenty four hours always open that name are One stop shops,A and G shops,etc, restaurants in the shopping mall,selling phones,clothes and beauty flowers, and cosmetic shops.I like very studying to do work . I think every student should work a part-time job for every college students.
