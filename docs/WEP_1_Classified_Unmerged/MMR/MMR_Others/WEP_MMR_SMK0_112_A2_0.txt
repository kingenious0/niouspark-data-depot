Cigarette smoke causes a lot of trouble to human lungs. Therefore, I strongly condemn smoking. Some people now find smoking in public restaurants and other places.Smoking  do so annoys other non-smokers. Smoking in crowded restaurants should be strongly condemned in every country. I think that those who behave badly should be dealt with effectively. People who smoke should be thoroughly informed that many people's lives are being lost due to smoking. Smoking makes young people lose their appearance and mental clarity. Smoking is something that should be avoided completely because it can cause many diseases. Every human being should be effectively encouraged to avoid it. We should help to make our world cleaner and better for human health by avoiding smoking. Smoking should also be avoided in public places, as well as around sick people, children, and pregnant women. Smoking is not good, and it is more expensive than usual to buy and drink, so it is as if you are paying for your own illness. Therefore, you should consider your own thoughts and avoid smoking. Smoking is something that both men and women, including the young and middle-aged, should never do. Therefore, I am strongly opposed to smoking.
