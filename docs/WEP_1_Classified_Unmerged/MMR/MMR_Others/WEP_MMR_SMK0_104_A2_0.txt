Smoking is the worst in the nothing to do.Every country smoking should be completely banned.But non-smoking people are not very like the smoke as smoking people are very like the smoke . Everyone can like the smoking but smoking area may avoid where aircon rooms, shopping malls, restaurants, public hospitals,etc. The lungs of the tobacconists can't breathier than normal people who are non-smoking.If tobacconists will include in the race,he may lose in the race.Because his lungs can't breathier than normal people who are non smoking.And another fact is not to do smoking in the restaurants.A lot of restaurants are making indoor rooms and aircon rooms where are smoking is the worst mistake nothing to do.In the aircon rooms, the smoke spread the whole room.Smoke also harms others.It also affects a person's lungs.A few cigarettes a day is enough to cause heart disease and another diseases that cancer,damages the alveoli, Pneumonia,Diabetes,Cardiac arrest, smoking can have a lot of side effects not only for you,but also for the people around you and the world.So I agree smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country.
