 There are increasingly number of people who smoke cigarettes around the world.However,it is not fair to stop them from smoking,in that case,people should also have the mindset-smoking only at the outdoor,or away from the crowd.From my personal viewpoint,I partially agree with the ideas that smoking should not be accepted at all the restaurants in the country,but it is not an appropriate method-banning smoking completely.

The smoke from smoking is bad for those-not only the kids but also the pets, if they breathed in the air which could cause the consequences for their health.Followed by this,smoking becomes inappropriate in the eyes of others.Eventually,the regulation of banning smoking at the puclic areas,for example;bus station,national park,school areas,and others.Hence,the rule is fair enough for both,either they smoke or not.

One the one hand,people could not satisfy with the rule,they want the influence over the ones who smoke by holding the fact that smoking is bad for health.People do smoking for some reasons and the common one is that they desire to reduce the feelings of stress,sadness.and the mixture of all kinds of thoughts and feelings.However,there will always be some kind of people withnarrow-minded and uneducated behaviour.For those people,the restaurants should prepare both outdoor and indoor place.This might be the best solution for the restaurants,instead of making the customers feel uncomfortable and shameful.

Overall,the government should acknowledge the citizens not only the fact that smoking is bad but also the mindset of people-demanding the power or influncence over the oppose.This is the main reason caused the problem-the different opinions over smoking should be completely banned or not at the restaurants.
