The world is changing and it is not enough for the students just with our school study. Some students do internship before they have finished their academic study. Internship gives them new experiences and new knowledge. Like the internship, part-time jobs play an important part in students' life. We can get new experiences and knowledge from the job. The world becomes globalized and opened. Almost every youth know that they need to get a job both for their social network and for their income. By doing part-time jobs, we can earn some money which we can use to buy the things we like. We can contribute to everything that we want. Having money makes you gain confidence. Therefore, part-time jobs become popular among the students. Some part-time jobs can be done outside the school hours. It is not a burden for students. However, the part-time jobs that have trouble with school works can give inconvenience for the students. There are also parents who don't want their sons and daughters to work before graduation in Myanmar. In my opinion, parents should give permission to work to some extent if the students do not have the problem with their school study since part-time job can pave the students for their career after graduation.
