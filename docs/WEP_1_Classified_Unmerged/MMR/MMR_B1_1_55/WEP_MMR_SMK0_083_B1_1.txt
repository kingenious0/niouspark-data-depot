 Smoking has always been a hot debate, as it has been shown to have harmful consequences on one's health. It is crucial that smoking be completely outlawed in all restaurants throughout the nation in order to encourage healthier living conditions and safeguard both customers and restaurant personnel.
First and foremost, a complete smoking ban in restaurants would protect individual health and wellbeing such as customers and staff at the restaurants. A known health risk, secondhand tobacco smoke causes a variety of respiratory and cardiovascular issues. The chance of harmful pollutants being inhaled by non-smokers is greatly reduced when smoking is prohibited inside restaurants, making everyone's mealtime healthier and more enjoyable.
Furthermore, a complete ban on smoking in restaurants would encourage  toward healthier lifestyle choices especially for young people who like starting to smoke as they think that they will be attractive to girls if they smoke. Reducing exposure to smoking in public places will eventually reduce the accepted norm of smoking behavior, resulting in a healthier society as a whole.
In conclusion, a complete prohibition on smoking in all restaurants is not just a concern of public health but also a crucial step towards making a dining environment that is cleaner, safer, and more pleasant. We can make tremendous progress toward a smoke-free future by promoting population health, which will benefit people who smoke, and the country as a whole.
