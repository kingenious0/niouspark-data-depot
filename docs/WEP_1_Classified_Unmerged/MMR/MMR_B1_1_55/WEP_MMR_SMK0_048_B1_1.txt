 As we, human beings are living together with each other, there must be some disciplines and rules for some special places in order to maintain the foundation of our environment. But there still have some disciplines that people cannot accept. For example,  Smoking is banned at all the restaurants  is one of the disciplines all of the people cannot follow. For me, this discipline is not very suitable for the smokers.
Smoking is the action that can disturb all the surrounding people. So, smoking is banned at most of the restaurants not to disturb other customers. In my opinion, banning for smoking at the restaurants is breaking the right of the human. Because there will be some customers who want to smoke. For those customers, the restaurants should give some service for them. For example, keeping some restricted place for them to smoke. 
Like this service can be attracted by the smokers. Also, this way is very suitable not only for the customers but also for the owner.  He or she can get a lot of demand and good review from them more than other restaurants. But, they should always be careful about the restricted place whether it is convenience for all the customers. By doing like this way, I think, it will be a win-win situation for both.
In conclusion, as we know, the people living in the world cannot be the same. So, there may have some problems while we are dealing with each other. However, we can solve these things by discussing with each other about the win-win situation. Like the case from the mentioned above, we should not think something only from one point of view. That is why, I disagree with the statement,  Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country .
