 Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in our country. Firstly, smoking is one of the way that
make air pollution. If we breath , smoke from cigarattes can  come into our nose so our health can affect worsely.
Air pollution can cause many bad natural destoryers such storm, lightning storm, tsunami and others. Smoke from
cigrattes can make us to happen lung cancer. Smoking can destory our breathing system. We should follow the 
non-smoking sign in every restutants, shopping centers, parks, buses, cinemas and public area. That is one kind of
ethic. Smoking can guide us to wrong ways. Fisrtly, we use cigrattes for fun then we focus to alcohol and finally we 
can even use the weeds or W.Y. According to religion, using alcohol is the one of the rules that Buddha banned.
We should not use cigrattes in public area because there can be people who cannot defend the smoke because 
of the weakness of lung, injuring of breathing system and others. At restaurants, we are going to eat some food but
if the smoke from cigrattes come into our nose, we can not continue our eating. So, you should think about others  
feelings. So I agree that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country.
