I agree that smoking should be completely banned out all the restaurants in the country. Smoking is worse for everyone and it can be disrupted for our health. It can be harm our lungs. Some old people smoke cigarettes medicinally but nowadays those cigarettes are not the same. The young people smoke every time and everywhere.Even, we can see that including  Don't allow to be able to smoke under 18 years old  on the cigarettes box but some teenagers ;14 or  15 years old do that everywhere. We should ban strictly to the young people from smoking in public areas or in the restaurants. Restaurant is a place that can get tasty food easily and everyone can eat comfortably. Many people eat their breakfast or lunch in the restaurants. They want to relax  there so that they eat out. This area should be non- smoking area because there has old people; grandparents ,and babies or children. If you want to smoke ,you can go out and you don't smoke in the restaurants. Most of the people are not actually to inhale your smoking smell,  of course,they are eating their lunch in the restaurants. The young people addict smoking even they know the side effects of smoking. Some people think that smoking is their own styles actually, this smoking can cause infectious diseases in their mouth, lungs and neck.So that  I agree that smoking should be completely banned out all the restaurants and also public areas, schools and colleges.
