                 I agreed that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking can not only damage the health of the person who smoke but also affect the health of the people around him. The restaurant is the place where all kinds of people visit. They can include the old ages, the kids, babies, teenagers and the pregnant women. If someone accidently smoke near the pregnant women, it can affect the health of not only the pregnant women but also the baby inside her. It can also damage the health of the old ages and babies if they are near him. That is why some restaurants announced that it is the 'no smoking area ' with posters. In some restaurants, the tables are very close to each other. So, if someone from a table smoke without looking around and noticing the environment, the people around him can affect their health by inhaling the smokes. If people have respect for each other, they should not do this kind of behaviors not only in restaurants but also at other public places. Smoking and inhaling smokes can cause both asthma and respiratory diseases. So, if there are people who have these diseases in the restaurant ,these smokes  can extremely damage their lungs.
