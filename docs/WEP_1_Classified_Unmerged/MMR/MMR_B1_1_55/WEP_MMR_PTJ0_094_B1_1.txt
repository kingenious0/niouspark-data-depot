"Yes, I'm agree. It is important for college students to have a part-time job because college students really need money. Money can make everything. So we had a lot of money. Every international country have a part-time job for college students but our country haven't a part-time job for college students. It's so bad for me. When we make a part-time job, we can solve our money problem like school fees. Money is second god. Nowaday,we are solveing person problems by using money. So we need a lot of money. Therefore, college students need a part-time job. Most country's college students can be choose by many part-time job but our country's can't. Therefore, I want a part-time in my country.

a part-time job. Part-time job can help us pay school fees and pocket money. So we need a part-time job. Every job can improve our youth's mind.
