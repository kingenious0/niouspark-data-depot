Stopping smoking in all restaurants is a good idea for a healthier country. It's like making every eating place filled with fresh air. When people smoke in restaurants, it doesn't just affect them. It bothers everyone around. Saying "no" to that is good for everyone. Think about the hardworking folks in restaurants. They shouldn't have to breathe in smoke while doing their jobs. With a country-wide rule, we're saying, "Let's make every workplace safe and healthy." It's like putting up a strong shield against the bad stuff from secondhand smoke, making restaurants better for the people who work there. Now, think about families having a meal together. Kids don't need to breathe in that yucky stuff. Pregnant women shouldn't have to worry about the air while eating. A rule for the whole country makes things clear for everyone. No more wondering if a place allows smoking it's like a breath of fresh air for everyone. This idea isn't just about us; it's part of a big movement worldwide. Many places are making sure their air is free from smoke. By having a country-wide rule, we join a team that cares about everyone's well-being, going along with the worldwide trend of having places without smoke. It helps everyone who works there, families having meals, and anyone who just wants to enjoy food without dealing with smoke. It's a big step to make our country cleaner, healthier, and happier.
