"Smoking is a habit that can hurt not only the person doing it but also those around them. That's why I believe smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants across the country. Smoking affects people's health. When someone smokes near others, the smoke they exhale and the one coming from the cigarette can hurt non-smokers, especially kids and older adults. Breathing in this smoke, called secondhand smoke, can cause many health problem like cancer. By banning smoking in restaurants, we can protect everyone health. And the restaurants are the place where family and friends come together to enjoy the food. Smoking can make dirty air and uncomfortable for people. So banning smoking in restaurants make more pleasant place for everyone. 
If smoking is not allowed in restaurants, some smokers might decide to quit .It could help them and others stay away from this habit. When smoking is banned in restaurants, it's like making a  rule to keep the air fresh and clean. It helps everyone have an enjoyable time eating out, free from any smoking smells or worries . That's why banning smoking in all restaurants would benefit everyone's health, create a better atmosphere, and encourage healthier choices."
