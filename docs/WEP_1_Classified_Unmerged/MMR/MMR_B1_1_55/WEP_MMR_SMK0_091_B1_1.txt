As a non-smoking person I agreed.I mean I not saying no to smoke to the people who smoke.It is their decision.Some people like to smoke or some people smoke because of their social environment like giving respect their boss in work when meeting outside of work.But due to health problem,elders who eat in restaurants of their health might not to be good due to their age.Smoking is not the same as drinking beer or alcohol.Drinking beer can only to the people who drinks.But Smoking can harm to other people around the smoking people and non-smoking people like as, not like the smell of the cigarette.We all come to eat at the restaurants not to smell the smoke from cigarette.If they want to smoke go smoke at the outside or go smoke at the free smoking area.But we really don't need to ban smoking in restaurants in all around the country.Because we all have our right ways to do whether we want in public.As my thought,If we ban smoking in country the cigarette company might be broke and workers from that company factory will be unemployed in no time.
