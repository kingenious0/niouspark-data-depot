We can be mostly seen that diseases in smoking. Because of smoking, most of the people' lungs are damaged and they have to write their valuable names to the dead notes . And then, Every people has to eat for their livings. Smoking can be diseases for not only smoking person ( smoker ) but also people that is near from smoker. Some of the countries, there has smoking area for people to remove and avoid from getting benefits that get from smoking. So, Every people has to eat for their livings .So, eating is also important for human beings. That is why restaurants are come out for people' hunger. Even though old people are talking to young people, teenagers and children to avoid smoking, they are keeping their smoking cigarettes. Sometimes, people don't want to eat homemade rice and curries. So, They go to the restaurants to eat something new. Then , I think every restaurants should have smoking area for smokers. And also , smokers should obey citizens' rules and good manners. To be short, smoking is harmful to our health. If that disease happens, we have to spend a lot of money on medicines and other needed things to cure this diseases. So, Smoking is bad for human beings in my opinion and every people and it can harmful to our health.
