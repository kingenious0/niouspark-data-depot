The second smoker can suffer the diseases like the real smoker.
    As smoking is dangerous for our health, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. Restaurants are always crowded and it can also include children or old people.They are more likely to suffer the diseases of being the second smoker.And they can't have the immune to resist it like young people.So the smoker should avoid smoking in the restaurants.
     Another point is that when we throw the cigarette carelessly, it can burn. It is the clear reason that should avoid smoking in the restaurants.There may be also people who can't resist the smoke of the cigarette. We should respect them.
     To conclude , banning completely smoking at all the restaurants may be  breaking the human rights.So, it is better to regard the smoking zone at the resturants .By this way, we can get a win-win situation."
