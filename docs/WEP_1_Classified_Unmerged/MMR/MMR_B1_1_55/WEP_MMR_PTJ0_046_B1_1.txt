 It is very important for college students to have a part-time job.  If a college student has a part-time job, he can 
 make his own money so he will not need to request his parents for money. A student who is derived from
poor family can not use his time absolutely in education because of many reasons for example his family
does not have enough money to support his college life , he wants working experience and others more.
He  can do whatever he want with his money. For rich students, he can use his all time in studying but
he should do a part-time job to get experience that  will make his future interview fluent. A part-time job 
can make a student' time precious and it will help a student not to waste his time. A student who gets a 
part-time job that fits with his hobby is very lucky. So he can do his profession and his hobby in one time.
But he should manage his time correctly.He should not use his all time in both job and studying. He should 
have free time because a person who does two types of work in one time is very tired. The word    Every work
has diginity   gives us motivation to do a part-time job. Doing part-time job is not low. We  don't need to be
shy for doing job.So I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
