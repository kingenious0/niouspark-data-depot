We, college students, are trying and studying each subject concerning with the fields that we have chosen.The student's target may be different from one another.Some try to get the high mark at the college.Some try for their parent's satisfaction.Others try to get a job that he or she wants.Most parents, including my parents, always say that you should only study at school age.They don't let their children to work a job before graduated because they are worried that their children about being bullied at the job.I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.Work experience is including as an important role in applying a work.We can get some experience from part-time job and also we can know more about people.Most jobs in our country do not accept the college students as a part-time worker.They are worried that their working hours will be affected if they employed a student.Thus, college students have few chance to get a part-time job.Actually,part-time job have such kind of benefits like money and time management, developing interpersonal skills, confidence, independence and gain experience.For above reasons, I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
