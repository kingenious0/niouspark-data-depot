"Personally, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. For me, I cannot smell the smoke. I feel like I am really hard to breathe. Especially for my mother who has heart problem, she cannot go to the restaurants because of that. Smoking is very dangerous not only for the people who smoke but also for the people around them. We can get lung and heart disease. Smoking really can kill us. For the pregnant women, it is very dangerous for the baby too. Thus, we should ban smoking, which is bad for health at all restaurants. 
Yet, I know it can't be possible, especially in our country. People do not obey the rules. There is also no special punishment and no people to take control for that. I hope smoking should be banned not only at the restaurants but also at any places. Cigarettes can get easily in our country. That is why even high school students smoke. They think smoking makes them look cool. Changing at once is not possible but if we teach the disadvantages of smoking to children, I believe there will be no smoking in the near future. "
