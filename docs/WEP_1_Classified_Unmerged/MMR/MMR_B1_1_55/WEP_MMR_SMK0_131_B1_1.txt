Nowadays , smoking has increased year by year all around the world even the teenagers enjoy it . To be honest, I hate if someone is smoking near me as I become a passive smoker due to their smoke. Smoking brings  detrimental effects especially lungs cancer for both active and passive smokers. Due to human rights ,smoking is normal and common but smoking areas should be restricted to prevent non-smokers or passive smokers because they are victims. In our country , smoking is common in tea shop , some cafe and some restaurants and even public. The worst is in tea shops because waiters provide gas-lighter to every guest and moreover, they serve with cigarettes. I have no clue how it has become but this is the worst ever as it can be dangerous not only for surrounding people who are enjoying their talks but also the surrounding atmosphere and the food we are eating. So we feel inconvenience and difficult to breathe. Therefore my final solution is to allow them a private area for smoking like a closed room in public and smoking should be banned strongly especially in restaurants.
