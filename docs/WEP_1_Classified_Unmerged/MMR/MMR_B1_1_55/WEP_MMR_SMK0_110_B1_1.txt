          I do agree.Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants.I have the facts why that is important. We should know smoking is dangerous at the everyplace and everytime.There is no benefit about smoking.Smoking gives only disadvantages like diseases about throat and lung, air-pollution,etc.
           Firstly, we are familiar about the diseases by smoking and we all know about that.There are many advertisings and announcements to avoid smoking.But humans are still smoking.That is why there are many deaths by smoking in many countries every year. Basically,breathing  the smoke directly or indirectly into our lung causes the diseases.So people do not actually smoke can also cause the diseases.Especially, at the public-area, everyone should avoid smoking.For example,at the restaurants, people should avoid because there may be various ages like children,olds and pregnant women.Most restaurants are fully closed the whole building and there is no window.So the air with the smoke are moving in the restaurant and it cannot escape from the restaurant. After sometime,it starts the population in the restaurant.One or twice is no problem but after many times, that dirty air can destroy our lung badly.This is only one fact about smoking and there are more disadvantages.
          To be concluded, since smoking has no benefit for humans,animals,surrounding and our whole society,we should avoid smoking.We all also need to ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country.
