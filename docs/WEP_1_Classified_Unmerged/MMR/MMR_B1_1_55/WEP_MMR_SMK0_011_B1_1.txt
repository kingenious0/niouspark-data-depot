Yes, I do agree that smoking should be really completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Restaurant is a place for eating and drinking somewhat with relaxing. It is not a place for smoking. Smoking is harmful for not only smokers but also surrounding people. When they smoke, the gas spreads out in the air. By breathing, other people becomes second smoker. In the restaurants, there are many people and also the children too. This is many dangerous. Students may be smokers by doing like that they see it. From man to children, everyone should avoid smoking. It is harmful not only physicals but also mental. Smoking cause many diseases that can hurt the lungs, pharynx, throat and also. Sometimes people smoke when they are in depressed because of work and the surrounding people. They drop the pressure and stress using this way. So, I do not say that smoking should be completely banned at all. But they should smoke in the smoking area and not in the public area. Smoking in the limited area for smokers cause the unwanted problems and contamination less. Should be never smoke not only at the restaurants but also other public areas   and completely banned it in the country. Follow the rules and maintain the environments. By doing like that the earth will be better and better and also the lifestyle of people will be higher and higher.Yes, this is win -win sitaution.
