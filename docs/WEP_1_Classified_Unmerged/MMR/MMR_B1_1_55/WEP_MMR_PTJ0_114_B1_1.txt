           Lately, part-time jobs have become popular. The job is divided into two types, part-time job and full-time job. Among them, part-time jobs are suitable for college students and university students. That's why I agree with this statement.

          In other countries, especially distance students have to rely on part-time jobs to find the extra income for the budget of the university. College students work part-time jobs such as cashier, tutor, babysitter, receptionist in hotels, library assistant, teaching assistant and restaurant server. There are many part-time jobs. By doing such part-time jobs, you will get many advantages. The main point  is that you will get extra income. And you can become independent  rather than dependent on others. In other countries, once they turn 18, they become independent, whether it is a boy or a girl. They live in a dormitory and earn their own extra income for their budget of the school. A part-time job can help students and cover their expenses and reduce their reliance on others.

          In summary, part-time jobs are very useful for college students. By doing part-time jobs, you will learn to be independent, and you will be able to stand alone. And you will have more confidence in yourself. So, I agree part-time jobs undoubtedly because of the points mentioned above."
