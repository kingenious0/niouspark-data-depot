There are many students who want to go to college.They need to earn some money to go to college.In many countries, some students are doing some part-time jobs.There are so many part-time jobs for students.Collage students go to university at afternoon and in the evening they go to part-time job to work.It`s fine for students.Not only students but also others can work part-time job. But in Myanmar, it's so hard to do part-time job. If we do part-time job we don't need to worry about money. The money which get from part-time jobs are enough for students. But It will be a little tired for them.But part-time job are reorient for students. The students are doing one more part-time jobs to get more money. Part-time jobs are divided day job and night job but most students are doing night job. Some are doing in supermarket, some are doing in the restaurant.
