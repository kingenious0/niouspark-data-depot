           Smoking has become one of the most popular problem not only in our country but also in the world. Later on, boys and girls are started smoking everywhere. It affects their health.That can only have negative effects for them. So, I agree this statement.

          Smoking is a bad thing. Now everyone smokes without discipline. For example, people smoke in public areas such as parks, playgrounds, restaurants and hospitals. That is an act that really should not be done. The smoke produced by smoking destroys the environment. And not only cause air pollution, but also affects people. Smoking is bad for yourself and others. If you smoke in a restaurant which is a public area, there may be many disadvantages. A place called a restaurant can have children, young people and old people. Your actions may affect the public's health. And smoking can be very damaging to your health. Smoking causes cancer, heart disease, lung diseases and pulmonary diseases. If you smoke more cigarettes, you will suffer from these diseases. 

          So, smoking does not give any advantages. In my opinion, I would like to have some kind of rule that if you smoke in public areas, you will be fined 10,000. If you smoke, you will spend more money because of diseases. I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country."
