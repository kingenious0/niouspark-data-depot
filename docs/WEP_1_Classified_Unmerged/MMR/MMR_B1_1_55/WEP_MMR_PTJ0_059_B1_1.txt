 Nowadays, there has been a trend related to the college students working part-time jobs. Some people believe that it is vital for college students to have a part-time job in order to gain work experience or to assist them with financial concerns. However, others argue that students can be overwhelmed by the stress of job. For me, personally, I think that college students should experience, what exactly a part-timer is.
On the one hand, there are a lot of drawbacks of doing a part-time job for a university student. Firstly, the students will struggle with their tight schedule if they choose to work outside. As a consequence, they may be late for classes and sometimes they may even skip them. Secondly, they will be locked by stress and pressure which can lead them to depression. Thirdly, it will give them not only advantages but also disadvantages if they cannot opt the most suitable job for them.
On the other hand, people can't ignore the explicit benefits of working a part-time job. College students working part-time jobs mean that they are polishing their communicating skills by dealing with different type of people. Moreover, they can get knowledge by solving social issues and problems in workplace. It may enhance their competences of problem-solving skills, interpersonal skills, and management skills. Hence, they will be very qualified staffs or employers in the future.
In my opinion, I think that all the college students should work at least a part-time job because it is such a golden chance to live their lives in an independent way. In addition, I believe that the advantages of working a part-time job outweigh the disadvantages. Therefore, I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
