             Nowadays, smoking is quite common among public and almost everyone especially young generations. Smoking has terrible impact both on active smokers themselves and people around them. In my perspective, the idea of smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. Although smoking can't be discarded easily at restaurants, we will need to take as a task to remove as soon as possible. Tips below will show why we need ban smoking at all restaurants.
             First of all, restaurant is the place where people come and have their meal and relax. There may be some kids with eateries and the main point why smoking should be banned at all. Kids can't resist the smoke and no one especially their parents don't want to see their kids other people smoking cigarettes and they don't want to imitate their kids those wrong habits. Not only kids but also even adults including old people can't stay because of smoke. There will be much harmful when the restaurants are air conditioned. Additionally, smoking must affect health disease such as serious heart attack and lung cancers concerning with respiratory systems. Both active smokers and people around them may cause serious diseases  and smoking can finally even lead to death. The symptoms rarely take time to show but later the symptoms may grow bigger and bigger and finally even the smoker himself can cause to death. It's too creepy to hear that kind of stuffs. As far as I conclude, smoking is a bad addiction for everyone and that's why smoking should be banned at all in restaurants.
