"I strongly agree with the statement.As a student,it's better to have a part-time job than earn nothing.
If we have a part-time job,we'll not only have a job experience but also use our own money for our school stuffs and basic needs in our daily lives.It will help our guardians such as our mother,father,aunt,uncle etc. who supports us money to attend college to reduce the amount of money they send us.It helps us to adjust the balance and manage the time  between the job,school and social life.Doing a part-time job makes us to become more independent as a student.It'll makes us know more about how to treat people or increase our social skills.We can manage our own income to some extent.
In sum,having a part-time job as a college student has many advantages.Managing money got from a part-time job and balancing time between job and college helps us to have systematic management skills which are really essential to increase our living standards."
