As a University students we Agreed.We need money to pay our students loan to the university,Text books,and lab coat for practical.The university is way more far from our home so We need to take Bus or Private School Bus.Sometime Our major friends group meet up at to restaurants or café to eat some foods and talk about our personal things or major subject things.But the only difficulty might be the time table of class attend in university.We can't rest from work for practical subject day in university because the practical is always that time in every weeks.So that might be the biggest problem for university students who work part time jobs.I am not saying we need to work full hours in part time job.But that is not our own business so we need to take the time that our boss give and to think rather work or rest from part time job.Some other is like try not to sleepy in class lecture because of the tireness from work.Most of the part time jobs from university sleepy in lecture time and teachers was not try to wake them up because they have to teach their chapter in the remaining time.So yeah Overall I agree because of the money cost in university.
