 Some people born with wonderful life and some with awful life. We can not create our own destiny. But we can make our own choices and we have human rights. Respect is the best thing that we have and we should take it seriously. Most of us cannot change gene and also habits like smoking and speaking loudly. But, if this habit is not good for you and your environment, you should avoid it in public area. In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
We go to the restaurants with our parents, friends and children as our own pleasant place to relax. We all know the disadvantages ofsmoking. Firstly, it can harm your health badly and the smoke from your cigarettes can lead to environmental harm. Secondly, smoking can cause intensive disease like cancer, heart attack and phthisic. Thirdly, you can suffer from insomnia because of the high rate of your heart beat.
Furthermore, smokers should respect others and the cons of your constitution. If you some in common area like restaurants, you should sympathize the anxious of mothers for their children. In addition, you are craving and cannot stand without smoking, you can go outside and crave your pardon.
Lastly, sometimes, you smoke cigarettes to reduce stress and create new things even in restaurants but you need to remind yourself as this is not good for your health and others.
In conclusion, human right is for all the people in the world. You do your rights but if it harms others, you do not deserve your right. We should live our life safely and save the world from dangerous situation. We can change the better version of the world by ourselves. So, my opinion is smoking should be completely banned add at all the restaurants in the country because you only live once and you deserve so mush better
