 I agree with this statement smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Smoking can affect our life. Smoking is dangerous for our health. The gas from smoking cigarettes destroys the fresh air and if the gas enters our lungs that affects our health. As for me, I hate the smell of cigarettes. I can't smell the gas. There are many people like me who cannot smell the gas of cigarettes. If older people and children breathe the gas from smoking, their health will not be good. In restaurants, there are many people who enjoy their food. If someone smokes cigarette in restaurants, it may affect them. So if u want to drink a cigarette, u should go to the place that can be. You mustn't drink cigarettes in restaurants. If you see no smoking sign in that area, you should not drink cigarettes in that area. This area may be a place where many people stay.Some restaurants have smoking areas and people who want to drink should go to this place. That is good for all people in restaurants. Smoking has no advantages for our lives. It affects our health. I advise you not to drink cigarette.
