 
While dining out, everybody ought to have the freedom to breathe in wholesome, smoke-free air. A smoking ban provides a happier and more enjoyable atmosphere for everyone, especially for non-smokers and people with respiratory issues like asthma.
Restaurants have a significant role in society as centers of interpersonal communication and civic engagement. By prohibiting smoking, they provide a good example for their customers—especially the younger ones—preventing them from starting to smoke and fostering an atmosphere of wellness and good health.  Families and non-smokers that might have avoided restaurants because of the smoke are more inclined to frequent smoke-free areas. Recognizing how crucial it is to safeguard the people's health, a large number of nations have already enacted laws banning smoking in public places like restaurants. By imitating them, we conform to worldwide norms and show our dedication to the health and happiness of our citizens.

For the sake of the general public's health and the safety of both customers and workers, restaurants must completely forbid smoking. By outlawing smoking, we foster a healthier atmosphere, lower the risk of illness, set good examples, and advance the economy. It's time for our nation to firmly oppose smoking in restaurants, making sure that everyone can enjoy their meals in a  smoke-free restaurant environment.
