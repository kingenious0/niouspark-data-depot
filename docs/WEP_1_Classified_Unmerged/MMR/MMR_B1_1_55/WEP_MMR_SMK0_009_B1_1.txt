 I disagree with this statement.However this is a public area you should and we should take caution of others peple situations. There might be including a person who has heart attack and some people having lung relating cases.Even if you don't know you shouldn't behave in this way.I feel like this is dont do thing right.we shouldnt an all the people shouldn't done this way.This is not forcing.I'm not forcing people to do this or do that.Everyone has their own opinions right?for be full or maybe half there might be some people who would agree with this statement.They might be Man or they might be woman.Despite the gender everyone has brains.They are not brainless creatures that god bless with.We have our own opinions and thoughts and some kinds of thoughts to decide on our own right,.diseases and some other things like drugs .All drugs start from a single cigrette  so drugs ; they are not some fun hazards to be play with.They are dangerous serious and yet they are not legally bounded by some other situations right.so I really do disagree with this statement.Just briefly not so strong that's all for my statement. And opinions of yours decide or don't that's all up to you lads.
