"In my opinion, it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Although  I do not have to pay for tuition fees, I still have to pay for food and staying at a hostel. The prices become a little too high year by year. Also as a girl, I want to buy beautiful clothes, shoes, and many other things. I want to eat everything that I want. Yet, the money that I get does not allow me to. I need more pocket money. Also, I want to attend college without any help from my parents. That will be the main reason why I really want to get a part-time job. 
From the other perspective, in our country-Myanmar, the part-time jobs culture among students is not very popular. It is also very hard to get one. Also, It will be very hard to maintain a balance between work time and study time. 
Anyway, for me I would love to try doing part-time jobs if it is possible. I want to experience many new things. I wanna face the work-life before really going into it. Nowadays, many companies want to hire people with experience. For us, it is really hard to get job experience before graduation. Thus,  I really hope, that part-time jobs to be more popular among students one day."
