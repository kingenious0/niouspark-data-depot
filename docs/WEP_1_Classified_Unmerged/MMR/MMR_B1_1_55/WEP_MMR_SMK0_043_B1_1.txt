 To be honest, behalf of the public, not just regarding my own view, I would like to agree with this statement. 
Some people say that somking can cause several diseases so that it should be banned. As a well-educated 
university student, it should not be banned at all. It just needs limitations and certain rules for smoking. Everything can't be stable for long without limit. The first thing  is to declare the bad sides and disaventages of 
smoking . Then, we need to define certain places for restrictions in most of the places especially where we need to deal with people. Some people are suffering from lung diseases and other related diseases through inhaling others' smoking. Those passive smokers are really worthless and they don't deserve  to suffer. To describe more, one of the busiest and crowed places is restaurant. In some restaurants, we can see the cautions like no smoking, smoking is not allowed, etc. Sadly, some people refuse to follow the rules because they can' t live without smoking and this habit grows day by day. So they don't have time to think about of the others. To say frankly, they are selfish and don't have the sense that it can distrub others and it can cause other consequent diseases not only for himself but also for public. Sometimes, it's quite hard to get out from the place at once when we start to notice the smoking as we are surrounded by crowds. The other important fact that I shouldn't mention is that it has worse impact especially on infants and oldies. So long story short, if we want to preserve our environment and lead to healthy lifestyle without any barriers, smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country.
