  For my opinion,I think it is important for most college students to get  part time jobs.Bemon many need money to spend on many thing.Such as playing games,having meals,giving presents each others and other things.
 When we become college students,our community are wider than before.So ,we will get many friends and we also need to enjoy the happiness with them.If you want to get happiness with them ,you need to spend money on them.Most of the parents don't give their children alot of money.So ,they want pocket money more.If you also want more you should find part time job which is suitable with you.By doing this ,you can get enough money and you will know how hard to get money.So you dare to spend your own money on happiness.
 As for me ,I can get extra money by teaching biology to the private school students.On the other countries the governments give many chances to the youths especially students.These chances are to give the students jobs which are suitable for them.Such as at cafe ,mini shops,bakery and other jobs which are easy to work for them.The part time jobs can also make students to be mature because this jobs make them to communicate with other people.So I'm very agree with it is very important for college students to have a part-time job.
