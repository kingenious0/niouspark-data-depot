Collage is a place not only to study but also to learn other skills. Some said that students should only focus on studying and they don't need a job as a student. For me, I agree with the fact that it is important to have a part-time job for the college student.  
It cannot be undeniable that we have to stand on our own partly as collage students. We are becoming adults and start to learn what the real world is. Having a part-ti me job can definitely help us to know about the people like how to communicate with people or how to solve the problems in dilemma. We can also have strength and courage to face with difficulti es. It is the first step of being independent human. When it is time to find the full-time job, we can be the priority to be chosen due to the previous experience of work. We will understand the value of money when we earn ourselves. It will slightly support to the struggles of our parents for the school cost, especially, the students who are being away from home. Since it is a part-time job, we do not have to worry about not getti ng self-time. Though our self-time may be less than usual, it is worth to do for our future. 
Though it may have challenges, it can be wonderful when we can balance time for work and study. Working is kind of training ourselves both physically and mentally. Thus, in my opinion, collage students should have a part-ti me job for their improvements.
