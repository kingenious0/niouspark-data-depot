I think that it is important for college students to have a part time job because I have a part time job. It's little difficult to manage my times between job and school. But I try to fix my timetable, it will be good for me. There're many advantages to have a job. I can make my own money and provide my family. Asking for money to use somewhere from the parents that is a big case for the college students. We don't ask for money from our parents and we want to reduce for us a lot of money. That is a reason why a lot of college students have a part time job and also me. I want to pay my school fees and others. And I want to help my parents. I think when I have a job that will be help for my parents and I can reduce a little for my parents's stress about money, family case, etc...  Because money is important for a family. We can't do anything when we don't have mony .We daily use money for food, bus fees, cosmetic, clothing, and so on. When we are more older, we can more cose money. That's why I am doing a job. There will have another reason for another student. Anyway my reasons are just 2 facts that is money is important for a life and to provide for parents that why I agree to have a part time job for the college students.
