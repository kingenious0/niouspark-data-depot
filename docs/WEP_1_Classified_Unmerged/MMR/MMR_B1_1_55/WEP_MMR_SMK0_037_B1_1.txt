 Nowadays, most of the people not only adults but also teenagers use tobacco. They also smoke in public areas without any disciplines. So, some people say that smoking should not allowed in public location. As a human beings in our society, I have also responsibility for our community. Thus, I totally agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. 
              First of all, smoking is the most dangerous habit for all the living things. Smoking in the restaurants causes lungs diseases and kills not only the smoker but also the people who come to the restaurants. Children also suffer the heart diseases, cancer, lungs diseases by inhaling the smoke. Smoking affect both the smoker and the secondhand smoker who are around the smoker.
                Moreover, smoking also destroy our environment. Smoking also cause air pollution. If the pregnant lady inhaled the smoke, it increases the risk for pregnancy complications. On the other hand, smokers say that smoking give them some advantages. They say that smoking help them to reduce stress, make them happy and help them relax. However, they can get these feeling in another way. They should not exchange their lives with unnecessary things.
              To sum up, tobacco use increases the risk for many types of cancers. It also reduces our immune system and causes kills. It is also dangerous for all living things including plants. It also causes reproductive effects in women. For all the above reasons, I totally agree that smoking should begin completely banned in all the restaurants in the country.
