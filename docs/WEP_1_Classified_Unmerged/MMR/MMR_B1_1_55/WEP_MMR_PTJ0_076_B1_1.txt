I agree on this topic.At the present time, we can see many sorts of jobs in the world or on social media.Last few years ago,part-time jobs weren't popular.A large percentage of people only know about full time jobs.At that time most students don't get the chance to graduate.In university,we need to buy our course books and also tutorial books or practical books.Some students are able to buy this books because of their pareants.For poor students,they have some difficulties to buy books. Some college students get support from their parents or families, while others don't.So that the students who don't receive support from their families need some amount of money to learn the lessons and go to the university.It is easy to get a part-time job in Korea,Japan and so on.In my opinion,there are a small number of part-time jobs in Myanmar.If there were a lot of part-time jobs in this world,the students can earn money and they don't need to ask their parents for money.Moreover the students who work will have better time-management skills than the students who don't work.Furthermore,they can manage the finance.Finally,almost every student needs to work under a company after graduated with the exception of rich kids.Most companies will employ who have experience.You will get some experience before you graduate if you worked part-time jobs in university student life.These are my reasons why I agree on the topic: It is important for college students to have a part-time job.
