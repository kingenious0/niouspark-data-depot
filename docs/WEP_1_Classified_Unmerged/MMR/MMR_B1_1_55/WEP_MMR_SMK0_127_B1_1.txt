"Smoking effects not only on smokers but it is also harmful to the people who breathe fog.I strongly agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country.

Smoking in public area especially at restaurants is rude and inappropriate behavior to the older person and pregnant women and children.At restaurants,there are many people of different ages and everyone is having their meals.At the moment,smoking cigarettes from the table of somewhere is annoying.It can be dangerous if there is a person who has huge lungs problems.
It is not acceptable to smell those unpleasant cigarettes smoke instead of the smell of delicious food.
According to the compound of restaurants,fogs are matter because the narrower the compounds is,the larger amount of smoke the customer gets.Many people who used to smoke do not pay attention and keep smoking at restaurants as a habit because smoking wasn't banned from the previous days.In order to reduce tobacco fog,smoking at restaurants should be banned.
To sum up, smoking has side affects on people who do smoking and people who inhale those smoke.So,I strongly suggest to ban smoking especially at the restaurants where many people are surrounded."
