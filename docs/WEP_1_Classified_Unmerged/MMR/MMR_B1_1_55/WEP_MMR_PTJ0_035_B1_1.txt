I believe that school should always come first but there are also some benefits to working, such as gaining experience and earning some extra money. That's why I'm on the side of who agrees that it is important for college students to have a part-time job .

Firstly, having a part-time job is that it can provide valuable experience in one's chosen field. For example, I'm currently studying marketing, so I might consider taking a part-time job at a local marketing firm to learn more about the industry and gain some experiences with real-world projects. I believe this could be a great addition to my study and make me more competitive in the job market after graduation.

Secondly, having a part-time job is that it can help cover your cost of books, food, and other essentials. College can be expensive, and having a job can also teach you valuable financial skills like budgeting and saving money.

However, it's important to remember that school should always come first.You should also have a regular timetables for your study even though you're working. I think skipping classes or neglecting assignments in order to work more hours is never a good idea. You need to strike a balance between work and school, and make sure you're not sacrificing your academic success for extra money.

In conclusion, having a part-time job can be a great idea for college students because you can gain experience and earn some extra cash.However, it's important to find a balance between work and school for success both in college and in future careers.
