Smoking can be considered as one of the bad things that can destroy health. Smelling the smoke can also give the same health problem with the ones who smoke. However, there are also people who cannot cut the smoking. On the other hand, there are people who can stop the bad habit of smoking. Starting from a very long time in the past, people passionated smoking as their life style. Holding cigarette in their hands became a fashion. Independent women needed to learn to smoke. Therefore, adults and smoking became a pair that will go together as part of growing up. As I mentioned about, even smelling the smoke can give trouble to our health, smoking among the people is inappropriate. So, smoking in the restaurants will be no need to explain. People come and eat to get a healthy life style. They do not pay the restaurants to buy the cigarette smell. However, if the smoking was banned in the restaurants forever, we are breaking the freedom of the people who smoke. Therefore, restaurants should create a room for people who smoke and a room for the people who do not smoke. And it is totally depending on the people to smoke or not to smoke because it is their duty for their own sake.
