I agree on this topic.As far as I am concerned,smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.Smoking is the silent killer for human being.It kills millions of people every year.There are a lot of side effects to smoking.In the first place,smoking causes air pollution. Our pleasant and beautiful environment can be destroyed for the reason that people smoke.There are many secondhand smokers in the world.Mostly,the ladies and babies are secondhand smokers.In spite of the fact that they aren't smokers,they will be harmed as real smokers.We may lose our family members by smoking.In many restaurants,the organizers arrange smoking areas for smokers.If smoking is banned at all the restaurants in the country,the number of smokers will decrease than the early.In addition,the smoker will suffer cancer and so many diseases. Besides,they can die earlier than the people who don't smoke. Moreover,your skin will be wrinkle if you smoke.You will look older than your present age.The government should punish not only the people who smoke in public places but also the people who sell cigarettes in the market.There is a saying  Smoking likes burning money .Using cigarette is a kind of money waste.If you don't smoke, you can save more money and you can live longer.In recent years,there are many programs to reduce smokers.Smoking is privacy.We won't be able to command or control all the people.The smokers will smoke whatever they want.However, many people were killed by smoking. Therefore,we need to ban smoking as much as we can.
