I agree of this topic. Because it's important for college students we spend a lot of money.So I think we have to work part-time job.For me, I don't want to spend alot of my parents money. The advantage of having a part-time job is we can use our time useful,correctly and then we can get more experience.By doing this we can get alot of knowledge, improve our skill, communication well with people(like customers or boss or senior) and we can get likeability.If we have all of this we can get a good position in the future.After we finished we have to work so if we have already experience we can get job easily. That's why part-time job is important. For a college students we need alot of money like to buy a book, bus fees and other essential thinng. When we need money we can use our own money not from our parents. Also I don't want to depend on my parents for everything. If I can I want to do everything alone and I want to be a strong women. In other countries, when they become teenagers they left their house and they start their new life on they own. So I also want to be like that.
