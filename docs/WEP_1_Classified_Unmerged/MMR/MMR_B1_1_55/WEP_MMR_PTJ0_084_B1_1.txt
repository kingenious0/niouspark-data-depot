 Students, especially from colleges and universities, ought to get a job for their expenses such as food,snacks,fees for transportation,internet and others.From my general perspective,it is true that earning money from part-time jobs is really reasonable for college students.However,there are always some people with different opinions on every factors.

Some people believe that teenagers,college or university students, must try standing on their own feet,which means that they have to work to be independent.When they have a job,they can earn some extra money,the first thing they would benefit by doing part-time jobs.That money would also provide the knowledge of its value,and the ability how to handle the living expense,bills and the cost of education.Moreover,according to work experiences,they would be the priority of selection comparing to others.

On the other hand,there are also some people ,including me,who oppose the idea that having a part-time job is crucial for college students.Some people consider that doing a part-time job is such a waste of time and energy.Instead of earning little extra money,they should prefer studying the lessons in order to achieve good grades in college or university.Those grades would enable to receive a scholarship program,and finally lead to obtain a job offering lots of money.People should look forwards the given amount of money from the scholarship programs,and the worth of the knowledge or education which would be offered.
 
In conclusion,I would not deny that there would be advantages to working,whatever,the benefits of studying weigh more on the advantages of having a job.In other words,students should not follow the money by looking just for a short-term.
