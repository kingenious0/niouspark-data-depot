In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the detrimental effects of smoking on public health and the need to protect individuals from the hazards of secondhand smoke. Restaurants, as spaces where people gather to enjoy a meal and socialize, should be safe and healthy environments for everyone. This essay argues that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. 
Smoking is a leading cause of preventable diseases and premature deaths worldwide. Secondhand smoke, the combination of smoke exhaled by smokers and the smoke released from burning cigarettes, is equally harmful to non-smokers.

A smoke-free dining environment enhances the overall experience for all restaurant visitors. Smoking not only releases unpleasant odors but also creates a lingering smoke haze that can be bothersome and off-putting to many people. The absence of smoke improves air quality, making the restaurant atmosphere more pleasant and inviting.

A complete ban on smoking in all restaurants is a necessary step towards creating healthier, safer, and more enjoyable dining environments. By prioritizing public health, protecting patrons and staff, and promoting social responsibility, such a ban would contribute to a smoke-free culture and reduce the detrimental effects of secondhand smoke. Restaurants play a significant role in shaping public spaces and can serve as catalysts for positive change. Therefore, it is imperative that policymakers and restaurant owners recognize the urgency of implementing a nationwide ban on smoking in all restaurants, thereby fostering a healthier and more inclusive society for all.
