 Some college students think that they need have part-time job. However, some believe that it is not important to do a part-time job. Many people say that students should focus only on their study. They think doing jobs disturb the students' education. As for me, I consider that a college student should work a half-time job. 
           First and foremost, students get knowledge from working part-time job. These knowledge make them mature and help them in finding their dream career. Next, they do not understand the society and different sort of human beings as they are only familiar with the educational field. Thus, the experiences from the part-time job let them know how to deal with different people.
          The another reason why I agree student should do part-time job is that they can earn extra money for their tuition's fee and other necessary thing to buy. On the other hand, some people explain that if the students work, they will lack attention in the study. They cannot have time to their own study. But, they know how to manage their time as they are the educated people. 
            To sum up, it can be said that part-time job help the students find their passion. They become mature and get many knowledgable experiences. They can also obtain financial stability for their fees and can help their parents in any way. Overall, it is clear that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
