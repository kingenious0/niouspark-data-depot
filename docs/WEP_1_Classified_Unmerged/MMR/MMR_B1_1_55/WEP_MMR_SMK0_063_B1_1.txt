       Everyone is aware of and agrees that smoking is an unhealthy habit for people of all ages and circumstances. Because of this, the reasons and harmful effects for smoking are displayed as a reminder on tobacco boxes. 
     Therefore the answer to the question   Should smoking be entirely prohibited at all the restaurants in the countries   is unquestionably no.   We must, however, respect one another's decisions. Despite knowing the harms caused by smoking, some people nevertheless continue to smoke. In our nation, there are several shops and restaurants with inside smoking areas. Therefore, if the restaurant offers something similar, I believe smoking is acceptable. If not, however, I believe smoking should be prohibited in public areas, including restaurants. Smoking has a greater negative impact on those around the smoker than it does on the smoker. We need to be aware of this for the main reason. 
To make dining for everyone healthier and more enjoyable, an entire smoking ban in all restaurants is a crucial first step. Restaurants should make their customers feel comfortable because they are public locations where people meet to eat. It is a proactive step that puts public health first, improves the quality of the air, and promotes the physical and mental health of smokers and non-smokers equally.
