 Working is a part of living. We have to study, work, relax and play for life balance. From worm to death, we learn a lot of new things and try to fix in the society. Studying and working should be balance because 'health is wealth'. We are responsible for our own decisions and choices so that we have to do what we can do. So, it is important for college students to have a part time job.
First of all, you can get extra income and better communication with other strangers. Everything is expensive in these days, so if you have part-time job, your parents' responsible for your school will be obviously release. Secondly, you can join extra classes with your own money. Using your own money and pocket is different because you can feel the result of your effort when you use yours. Furthermore, you will know the value of money and how to use it effectively. Lastly, your thought and opinion on money will change and you can get motivation from your co-workers and you will realize living in this kind of world is not easy as you think.
In conclusion, studying is the most important thing for students but you have to take responsibility as an adult. But, never do above boundaries for everything. Being an adult is not easy. So, as a college student, it is important to have a part-time job for your extra needs because the world is still developing and we need to remind ourselves as our parents are getting older day by day. So, know your limits and do it in a right way.
