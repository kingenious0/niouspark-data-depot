"We all are students .So we enjoy like student's life. Sometime we need to job due to some cases during learning about our subjects. In Myanmar, there is no place in job for students  and companies are not offer job for students. They all are want full-time workers. But we are not do both. So they should offer part-time job. 

Firstly, we have own money and spend our own when we have part time job. So we can use for school fees. But we will tried because we do two thing that is job and studying. In work , we meet many people and their hobby or ambition or goal. So we get as a little support from them. And we can find the people who is same hobby and specialize in his industrial field.so we get advice our gold from them. But we need to know what is important  and what is unimportant  now. When we have a job , our family don't worry about our school fees and our pocket money. Our family are also do some investment with their money. But When we can get our own money, we may not study seriously our school subject.

Conclusion, being part-time job in Myanmar is very important for us. we help my own and or our family. "
