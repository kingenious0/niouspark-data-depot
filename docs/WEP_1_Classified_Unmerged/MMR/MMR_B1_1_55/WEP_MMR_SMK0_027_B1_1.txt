 Smoking is the process of inhaling and exhaling the smoke of tobacco. Many people love to smoke cigarettes for a short time pleasure. Some university boys I know always smoke cigarettes between 20 to 30 cigarettes a day. Smoking cannot be stopped if the mind is not determined. Extreme smoking can lead to cause so many health diseases such as cancers, respiratory disorders, lungs diseases. 
Smoking causes extreme harm not only to the people who smoke but also to the surrounding people who inhale the smoke by passing by or sitting together. However, I disagree with the statement that smoking should be banned from all the restaurants. Although smoking is extremely harmful to people, sometimes, smoking cigarettes is regarded a thing to reduce stress, feel pleasure for a short time and concentrate. This is the reason why so many people couldn't quit smoking because they think they can't deal with so many work pressure. Smoking boosts peoples' nerves to become calm and make minds clear. Moreover, in some settings, smoking is an icebreaker. Smoking is a great way to socialize with friends by handling a cigarette. It is easier for people who smoke to fit in the same group and become friendly friends. These are the reasons why smoking should not be banned from every restaurants. It also doesn't mean smoking should be allowed in every place. 
People shouldn't smoke in some places such as universities, stage schools and public areas. The smoking areas should be specified and people should allow the rules and smoke in only that area. They should be aware of that extreme smoking can cause breathing disorders and even death. The world be more pleasant to live in if each individual following the smoking rules.
