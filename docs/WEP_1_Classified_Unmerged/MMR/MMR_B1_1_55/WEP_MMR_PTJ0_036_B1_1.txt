        From the primary level to the high school level, most students are supported all of the costs by their parents or their guardians. At that levels, most had to take their help since we were not old enough to find a job and make money by ourselves. However, being a college student, we are adulted and have to come out of our comfort zone. It is the time and the first step to meet the real world. So, we should have the ability to stand on our own feet and make our own effort whatever we do, to face all the reality and bitterness of the real world. Hence, I think that having a part-time job is important for college students. Firstly, it can help the students to acquire time management skill in the fact that they can manage their schedule systematically and effectively, for instance, their study time, work time, leisure and so on. Then, the costs are more in college. Even though our parents support us, it should not be for all of the costs and we should pay for it partially. Thus, a part-time job can help us to make money for our college costs fractionally. Furthermore, doing a part-time job, we may know the value of money because we have our own income by using our own effort. Besides, at a part-time job, we have to communicate with various people such as customers and clients. So, our social skill can be more improved. In conclusion, we can improve our time management skill, social skill, can get a lot of experiences and knowledge about life. Then, we can use them in future when we get in our professional fields. Therefore, I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
