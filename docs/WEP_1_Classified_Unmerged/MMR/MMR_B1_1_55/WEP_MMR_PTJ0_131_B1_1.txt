Being a college student, my university life is full of duties and tasks to accomplish such as tutorials , presentations , assignments and group works. On the other side , I am also a freelance teacher of high school students. Through my experiences , there is some time I think having part-time job is supportive to an extent but sometimes it is difficult to handle my work and college to be balanced. My daily life is almost lack of my private time because I always come back home around 8:00 pm. Having shower and dinner takes about one hour for me to start my study time. I need to sit on my study table until 10 or 10:30. Thus my university days are such tiring and stressful. However, I earn my monthly income to cover my expenses and thus it is very much satisfied for me that I don't need to ask my parents for my pocket money and I can even support them to some extent . To conclude , my university life is , even though, challenging to manage my time ; I can still meet the deadlines of the assignment and tutorials and do my best. Therefore, having a part-time job is not totally necessary but for the students from low-income families should have one and it can make us to be independent .
