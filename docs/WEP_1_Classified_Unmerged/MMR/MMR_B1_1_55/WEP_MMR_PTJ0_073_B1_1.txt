 

College students who work part-time are better able to become financially independent by paying for their own expenses including tuition, books, and rent. Students who work part-time gain experience in the real world that complements their academic training. They gain useful abilities that they can use in their future employment, such as problem-solving, communication, teamwork, and time management. Students who work part-time are exposed to a wide variety of people, including coworkers, managers, and customers. Through such conversations, students might create contacts that may be useful in getting apprenticeships or future job opportunities.. Contrary to what many people think, working part-time can improve academic success. The development of good organizational abilities, time management skills, and the ability to balance obligations are all taught to students. Improved academic performance is frequently a result of this increased discipline. College students benefit completely from doing a part-time job. They gain the ability to balance a variety of duties, overcome obstacles, and establish good work practices. They are better equipped for the pressures of the working world thanks to these experiences, which also promote adaptability, confidence in oneself, and individual growth.
Due to these reasons mentioned above, personally I do believe that college students should do part time job.
