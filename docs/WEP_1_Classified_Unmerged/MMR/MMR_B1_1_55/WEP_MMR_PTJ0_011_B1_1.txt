    Yes, I do agree that it is important for college students to have a part time job. In life, everyone see many  events, problems, difficulties, loses, achiveness, and loving kindness that make you to grow up. From a baby to a child and to adult and to a man, etc. From childhood, we learn to be responsible for everything that we do.As a college student, part time job is important because it can help and learn you how should we live in people, how should we treat people greatly and to be good in society. Having a part time job make you feel that everything is valuable and you should be your own. Don't disturb your school life and one and one can be systematically and expect in your field. You should be hard working in your lessons and be careful in your class what the teacher say and learn. If you are a rich kid, you will think like that part time job is no need for you and feel like that it is so borring and bother. I must say this thought is not right. Part time job is not only for money but also for a chance that we fixed it. As a conclusion, doing part time job has many advantages. We can live on our own with high confidence. And we can be successful not only in the school but also in the work and in the lives.
