           Many youngsters around the world are taking part-time jobs for the money. Looking for money in this century is not easy for human beings, especially the ones who do not have a background, power or support from others. I believe we can aid our parents indirectly by doing that kind of job. To those points, I completely agree with those who are having at least a part-time job.
         Firstly, education is involved as a part of important matters. In almost every country, the best university is situated in the capital city. The main fact is that the living cost may be higher than others. Secondly, most people are struggling to find money rather than happiness. To be honest, it makes sense as everything can be bought with money in this era. For education, we have to buy textbooks and other books for education. We can solve this problem ourselves if we have a job. Besides, we can provide the things without asking our parents. And also, we can observe new experiences from part-time jobs for the rest of our life.
            On the other hand, some people argue that they cannot take any job as they do not have much time. I accept that if the speaker is an adult. Young people are at the age of human-paradise. We can discover people who are studying their lessons as well as possible by doing several part-time jobs; for example, foreigners in Japan. 
          As I mentioned before, part-time jobs can help us with not only life experiences but also kindness to our parents. By helping our parents just a little, not too much, let our souls receive a couple of good merits and put a smile on our parents' face.
