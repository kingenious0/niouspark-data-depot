Nowadays, there has been increased in smoking population in our surroundings.But, smoking can cause diseases including lung cancer, heart disease and tuberculosis.Non-smoking people can also affect these diseases by inhaling the tobacco smoke.So that smoking is restricted in public places in most countries.Smoking should be banned at indoor workplaces and public places such as healthcare, educational, and government facilities restaurants, retail stores, libraries, hospitals and on public transport.Smoking areas should be arranged for the people who smoke in this places.This way is justice for both smokers and non-smokers.People regard smoking in the restaurants as an impolite manner because the smell affects all the people in the restaurant.These smoke can generate some cancer-causing compounds in the food. The place like restaurant can have all kinds of people - infants,kids, adult and elders.Moreover, It is also dangerous for emergency because restaurants use gas and may harmful about fire.Creating the smoking area has already solved all this problem.For this reasons, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in each and every country.
