                                As a university student, I believe that it is important for the students to have a part- time job. Nowadays, the prices of every goods rise as the dollar prices rise. So, it is not easy for us to spend only the pocket money that our parents give, especially for the students whose family is not wealthy enough. There may be some courses that the students want to attend but can't because of their unwealthy  situations. For those, part-time jobs are the finest jobs.  It also make the students to become more extroverted and companionable. And they will also get experiences at the teenager life and it is good for them when they become adults. And they can also communicate with the people older than them. This will also improve the social skills of the students. They will also save money for themselves. Also, the students from wealthy family should part-time job. Because it can get many experiences whether they are good or bad. They can know not only their working skills but also their communication skills. If they work hard, they can also support some money to their family. But the only bad fact about this is they can only have less time for their studies.
