"All over the world , people are smoking everyday. Smoking is mostly seen in smoking area, car park and etc . Burmese people also smoke in every where. for example bus-stop. Burmese old man like smoking. So they all feel throat problem. Some people are extremely 
this problem. Some feel throat cancer or TB or other health problems.

A lot of Burmese young man like smoking. they smoke every places. I always see in bus-stop where they smoke. In Myanmar, Smoking area is  less than national parks.When you breath the smoking smell , you are more  problem than the smokers.When you breath too much , you have got sore throat.When you are secondary smoker or first smoker ,you feel dizzy 
 and headache , rapid heart beat and shaking hands or legs .When you smoke very much , your lips is slowly black and your lungs too.the liquid in your stomach is black when it mix with smoking gas.This gas enter  form nose to brian when your brain is black too. And you feel throat problem. In this case, you can get treatment and stop smoking .But  when you continue smoking , you can get cancer in the throat .Fortunately, you can get chemo.

Above the reasons, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. But Restaurants should get smoking areas or smoking rooms."
