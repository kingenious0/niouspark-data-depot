     I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. As being  a college student ,we want a lot of money to buy what we need everything including books such as knowledge sharing books , English learning books, etc. And , we always go to the university so that we  spend our pocket money for transportation fees and our lunch. As you know , everything is  a high price nowadays. So ,we have not enough money that our parents give us for one day amount. If we want to spend a lot , we will  find a part-time job actually.  But in my country ,there has less jobs for students than other foreign countries.By working part-time job,not only can get income but also we could have obedience, confidence, patience and more social skills.There are both advantages and disadvantages for having part-time job.We are literally tired and worried about our jobs.Having part-time job,we can get little stress but we should try the best for incomes. In foreign countries, all of the students have they are part-time jobs. They have no leisure time.But we can see that they are smart and outstanding students because they can earn money for their family and education with their own incomes. If we have owned income, we will do what we like.Thus, our parents don't scold us because we spend our own incomes without their own money. As being college student we are older and older by years, we must stand our own way and we should do more hardworking. Every job has proud but we  must choose right ways. Therefore, I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
