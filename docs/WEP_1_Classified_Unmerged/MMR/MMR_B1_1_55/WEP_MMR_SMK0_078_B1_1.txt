     Smoking is very popular nowadays.You can see most people are enjoying at smoking.Smoking make them  to feel relax so we should not make rules them not to smoke.I said lucidly nobody don't like to make rules to them.I also don't like to make to me.
 If you make rule such as where is a no smoking area,smoking don't allow these words make them so annoying and make upset.It is same that you interfrences to their privacy.Most people are smoke when they are outdoors such as teas shops ,bus stops,pavements and roads.I also smoke so I also don't like to make the rules to me .Although I don't like rules I don't smoke the places where the rules are made.I dom't like rule but I respect the rules.When you pay respect each other the rules are not to announce.
 Although smoking make them unhealthy ,you should not make rule for them because their lifestyles are their rule.You should pay respect to them.We have only rule that is we should not interfrences to other people cases.Especially don't make rules not to do what they enjoy to do.So I disagree with smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
