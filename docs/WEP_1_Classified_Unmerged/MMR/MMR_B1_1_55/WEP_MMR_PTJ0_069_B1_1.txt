I believe that it's crucial for college students to work a part-time job. We have a lot more desires as college students than we did as high school students. We want to travel to many places, eat delicious meals, and purchase new items. Some college students find that the funding provided by their parents is insufficient. As young adults, we desire to support ourselves financially. And occasionally we feel pressured when we ask our parents for further pocket money. First and foremost, doing  part-time work allows us to get fresh working experiences. Our experiences will be beneficial to us at work and when we establish our own business when we grow old. A college student, in my opinion, should have an interest in both academics and earning some pocket money by doing part time job. Second, we can use our own cash to enroll in courses that we are interested in, like ,cooking, baking and art classes like how to make bouquets. Additionally, college students can work freelance job like translators. They can improve their translation skills by working a part-time job like this one. A student won't improve at any other talents if they don't participate in extracurricular activities. In conclusion, I believe that part-time job is a good idea for college students to get experience and to earn some extra pocket money.
