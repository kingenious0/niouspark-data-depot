I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking is not good for health.It makes us a lot of damage for health. Not only for smoker but also near from him can cause damage too. In this country, a lot of shopkeepers sale cigarettes to young people like 12,13,14,15,16,17 years old. They are only under age. They are just kids. Shopkeepers sale cigarettes to young people for the money. So young people can buy cigarettes easily and they smoke it easily. Thay smoke everywhere like home, public place, office, school, restaurant, etc... At the restaurant, there are all kind of people like babies, kids, teen-agers, men, women, older people, etc... When the smoker smoke at the restaurant , the people who don't like  smoking will annoy and who have some kind of illness, they will be worse in health. For babies and kids, when they breathe the smoke , they can be a lot of problem in their respiratory system and not good for lungs. And the babies and the kids are learners. They will learn that bad habit and will do when they become at teen-ager. So I suppose that smoking should be completely banned at the all restaurants in the country.
