 To be honestly,for all both side ,there  are advantages and disadvantage for day college students and distance  college students.So,I can say disagree or agree.However, in this statement,I would like to say more advantages and disadvantages instead disagee or agree.First of all, I would like to say  advantages and disadvantages for day students.For day students,they are busy with school work and project and they are  busy  with school homework in the weekend.So,if  they work, they will be more or less affected in some area.Not only they will be more or less affected in some area but also if  also affect  health.And the last one,they have no time part-time job.And if I say advantages for day students,They have certain qualifications and thorough knowledge of the respective  field.So ,in my opinion,If possible, by providing practical work experience in cooperation with the government and relevant business organizations, the day students will get practical work experience .By doing this , the day students will be able to work professionally in the relevant business.
For distance students,Although they have work experience, they do not have a good understanding of their respective fields compared to day students.For instance,as I am a law student, I have to know more thoroughly than other areas.Law requires not only studying, but also reading a lot and thinking a lot. For example, to know how to decide a case and how to solve it, you need to have a lot of knowledge instead work experience.You need time to read a lot. Therefore, as distance students, especially law students, it is more difficult.
