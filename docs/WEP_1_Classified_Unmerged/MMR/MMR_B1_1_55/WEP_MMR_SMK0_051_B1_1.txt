              Many people smoke in public areas, especially in Myanmar. According to research, smoking can affect people directly or indirectly. As for me, I totally stand with the statement that smoking is not allowed in all restaurants.
             We can easily find out that there are many disadvantages to smoking in restaurants, both for themselves and their surroundings. In restaurants, firstly there can be sometimes pregnant ladies or older people. If there will be undisciplined smokers, pregnant ladies and some people can be damaged by the smoke. Besides, infants and kids will also have meals with their family. They are too young to inhale smoke which contains carbon dioxide and other dangerous ingredients. 
            Secondly, it annoys people who are having a meal peacefully at a restaurant. Imagine a period in which smoke comes into your mouth while you are having your favorite dish. In my view, I guess my anger will explode at that criminals. Moreover, smoking can damage our health extremely. It can damage our pharynx and lungs. Lungs are essential for creatures to absorb oxygen and release carbon dioxide. So, is there any reason to smoke in life? Also, there are no benefits for smokers. 
          Finally, many people accept that smoking is bad behavior. The one who smokes in public areas, mainly in restaurants, can be regarded as a ruffler. Parents may teach their generation not to smoke in the future. Then, children remind it and they will be disdainful of smokers. Therefore, people should avoid smoking as much as possible.
          To conclude, pregnant ladies and older people cannot resist smoke. Pregnant ladies are VIPs because they bear future expectations for the country. For those reasons I mentioned before, I accept that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants.
