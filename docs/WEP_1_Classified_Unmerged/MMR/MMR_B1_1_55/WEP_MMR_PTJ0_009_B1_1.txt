 I disagree with this statement.I disagree above this meaning because it hhas any ways.
Actually,the job opportunites concerned with the part time job have only in the
  distance students.Usually,it cannot be doing the part time job to the daily students.
Units because they have no time to work it.They are learning their units almost the
 whole day. They are losing their time to learn the lessons.If they have the part time job
 they really cant focus on it.And also it is frustrating to  calculate all subjects to do at work.
I can't really focus but who knows maybe other people can focus on. I rezally don't know what to do but
its just you know cant focusz and other issues things is enough
frustrating enough for me.And it is also hard to ride bus at evening night and also oh at late duties.
you will not even imagine ths is really hard.And the people can't focus on two things maybe they can.But the budget 
you know some people works only for budget buyt not for the help for your own parents and its exhausting to know.And the distance students only works and they works so the people who have been graduating is becoming
lesser and lesser its sad to know and it really does.So I really disagree with this statement.
