       Nowadays,there are a lot of developing countries which can give part-time jobs for college student.Part-time jobs for college students are not good at all and it is somehow bad for them.
       First of all, college students can't get enough time to study their lessons when he or she do a part-time job.They may feel tired after doing this because they attend the class in the morning and they do part-time job in the evening or night.Sometimes,their work time may be the whole night.So, they may not concentrate the lessons when they attend the classes or do the homework.
        However, having a part-time job for college student makes them not only get extra money but also  get experience.They realise to value money because they try hard to find it.As they are adult,it is not convenient for asking money to their parents for each and every cases.When they can find money on their own,it can also help to improve their self-confidence too.When they do part-time job ,they can learn how to communicate with many different people with different personalities. 
            There are both advantages and disadvantages of part-time jobs for college students.In my opinion, it is also important to have part-time jobs for college students if only the  work hour is suitable and convenient for them as  it can give us extra money and invaluable work experience. "
