"I strongly agree to completely  ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country.Smoking is a bad habit that most people are usually addicted to.Prolonged smoking can lead to lung cancer.As we cannot prohibit people who love smoking,we should limit the smoking areas.Especially,smoking should be completely banned in public area.Restaurants are one of the top places that smoking should be completely prohibited.Because the smoke will be spread through the restaurant and people,including children and old people will accidently exhale these smoking air if someone smoke in a restaurant.That's a great harm to all the people in it.It is breaking human rights of people in the restaurant.As we are human beings,we should have respect on each other and behave well in public areas.Additionally,we should not interrupt someone because of our own pleasurable manners like smoking.
In sum,smoking in public areas,especially restaurants should be completely prohibited because it is sure that it will have a great harm on people,breaking human rights.Disciplined life lead a better standards of living in every country."
