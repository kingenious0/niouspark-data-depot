"       I think every students need part-time job.
Because we meet every person so we will get  many knowledge.We can spend this knowledge our work or environment.And we can pay our school fee.Other,we can pay our hostel fee.We can help my parents this paying.So we can proud ourself.
          We can leaning by listening the language of the other country people.We can improve listening skill.We can study english language myself.We don't need to ask our parents money.We can stand only one.We don't take the helps of anyone.Other one, we can pay my expenses myself.So, we will reduce the expenses of my family for myself.
              We can improve the number of friends because of we treat and speak many people.We can meet different people so we can know different mind of other people.We can get many experiences.So,I think the part-time jobs are good for every students.We cannot depend our parent every students.Yes,I agree the part-time jobs is important for collage students."
