I strongly agree about this topic. Because it's very important to our health. In human being, health is the most important part of our life. By smonking we can have a health problem like heart disease,lung disease, breathing problem, cancer and so on. Smoking can cause alot of problem in the world. In my researched, WHO estimate that more tahn 8 million people die per years. So I wish somking should be completely banned at all the public places in the country. Especially, at the hospital, school, bus stop station park and so on. The most dangerous part is that it harms almost every organ of our body.Also for a smoker, they can't live longer than non-smoker. Nowaday, many young people smoking in very young age. By doing tjis they destory their lifes and give a lot of pressure for their parents. Young people are died because of smoking. That's why I agree to banned smoking in every country. It is very bad to smoke around children's. It can harm their lungs because their lung are stills develiping. Also it's very very dangerous for pregnant women. When she smoke it can harm to her unborn baby. Smoking harm evry people and it can destory the world. So I hope in the future smoking should be banned in every country.
