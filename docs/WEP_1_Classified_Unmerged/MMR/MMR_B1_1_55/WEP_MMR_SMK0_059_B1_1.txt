 In these days, smoking can be regarded as a social issue all over the countries because not only smoker himself but also people around him can be suffered from the negative consequences of it. So, a lot of people suggest that smoking should be completely restricted, especially in common areas such as restaurants in the country. I personally think that it is a good idea and the reasons will be discussed in the following paragraphs.
Significantly, there are a great number of side effects caused by smoking that cannot be ignored. Firstly, smoking is a horrible enemy of lungs and mouth which can even lead to cancer, which is a chronic disease and cannot be totally annihilated. Secondly, it can also trigger heart diseases, shortage of breath, and stroke. Besides, some smokers said that they loss their appetite and cannot focus on their daily tasks because of an impact of smoking. Moreover, even if they try to quit it, they have to overcome the difficulty of sleeping. 
Furthermore, smoking is very dangerous for non-smokers of different levels of age including young children if they are surrounded by smokers. Typically, there are various types of customers in a restaurant. Kids and older people will definitely come along with their families in order to enjoy the meals. They are really sensitive to the undesirable effects of smoking.
Overall, it can be assumed that smoking is beneficial for human with no reason. Although it is true that everyone has their own right whether they will avoid it or not, it should not be allowed in a common spot like a restaurant by considering for other people' health. Hence, I think that smoking should be forbidden in all the restaurants.
