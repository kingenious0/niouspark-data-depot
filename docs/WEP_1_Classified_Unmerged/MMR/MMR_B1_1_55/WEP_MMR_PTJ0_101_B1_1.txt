Part-time job is a suitable work for students not only in our country but also in another countries.Students,they had been depend for 16 years in their parents until they had finished matriculation exam.When they become college students,they don't want to depend on their parents.So, they find the part-time job around the city to work in.The have to  attend the class regularly and they want to find another pocket money so they agree to work.Part-time job is good for college students because they don't need to work the whole day.In college students lives, they want to make many things.That are for funny and relax their minds.If they will go outside with their friends,they really need money to spend for eating and shopping.So they want money to spend. At that time when they will have part-time job ,they don't need to worry about it.And they won't scold from their parents.In college,there were many things to buy such as books,lab coats and the other things. That's why students want  to get more money from part-time jobs.Part-time jobs  give many benefits.For students,I think they also like their part-time jobs.
