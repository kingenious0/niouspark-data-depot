"It is always argued that it is important for college students to have a part time job.I agree with this statement because it is more meaningful than making money.
First of all,doing a part time job is one of the challenges that a college student has to overcome.In a college student's life before starting a career,there is a lot of charges to pay off such as accommodations fees,tuition fee and other extra costs.It is not easy enough to manage monthly expenses as bill.However,extra money can be made by doing a part time job in free time.
On the other hand,some people argue that there is not enough time to study because of doing part time job.I support that it is because of poor time management.As part time job of tutoring children,college assignments can be finished with them.As part time job at restaurant,we can get some tips from the customers and can also make friends with other students who work part time job at the same restaurant.In this way,relationships circle can be wider than before.It can also be confident considering with making money by my own.
To sum up,doing part time job in college days enriches a lot of unexpected events and personal experiences which are hard to seek in adult life.I completely believe that those life experiences brings variety of feelings and valuable life lessons."
