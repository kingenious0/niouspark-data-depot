 As a university student, I would like to agree with that statement for some reasons. First of all, all we need
to know is that we live in a competative world in today's age. Everyone looks busy by struggling with 
collecting data, information and experience. So if we don't want to fall behind the others, we are bound to
start doing something new. In my opinion, finding a proper part-time job is going to be the best of all. It can
save our tution fees as well as offer extra money for our living. The good point is that we don't need to ask
for the pocket money from our parents since we have our own income. Later, we will become more confident and independent than ever before. At the same time, we will get to know how to treat people right, then, will have the sense to be able to differ people's likes and dislikes in a short time. To say frankly, they will know how to live life with the improvement of communicating skill and social skill. In this 21st century, these kinds of valuable soft skills are real backbone and basic key for our future. We will be ready and be able to withstand most of the upcoming life problems in the future. Futhermore, we can apply all these experience and knowledge on our future business. when we apply for scholarship or internship program, these experiences like having part-time job will provide us in some ways. One more fact is that we don't need to look down on those who work in part-time job as getting a job is a honourable and noble profession. In short, people who get part-time job are prone to get achievements in their lives .
