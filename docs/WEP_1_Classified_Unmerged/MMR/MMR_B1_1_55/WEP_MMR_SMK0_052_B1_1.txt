Yes,I agree above the statement.We should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.Because smoking  can very hurt  not only yourself butaslo your loving people  and society and health is very important for human-beings.Thus,they say that  health is wealth .So,to be healthy , we ourselves have to do some things or avoid doing some things.One of the things not to do is smoking.Smoking is like slowly killing yourself.If we smoke , we breathe in not only oxygen but aslo the smoke which is full of carbon dioxide.It causes damage to the function of the lungs.The more we smoke,the more the function of the lungs is damaged.Not only the lungs are badly affected by smoking but also every organ suffers the same bad effect,especially the heart.Smoking is the main cause of cancer,which certainly causes death to us.Smoking will cause the society to suffer the same negative effects as above,as well as cause mental disturbance,especially in restaurants.So we should be avoided more.In my opinion,I think we should effectively stop smoking in the restaurant.Some restaurants have  no smoking signs but some people don't follow it.So,like other countries,if there is a punishment system for littering or smoking ,and  our country does the same,we will be able to reduce and ban smoking.
