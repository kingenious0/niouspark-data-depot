I agree of this topic because College students needs own lifestyle. We should not make our parents to pressure. The College students spend a lot of money. So we make decisions how to make our own way. Doing both school and work will give us new experiences in life. We can learn not only study knowledge but also life knowledge. We should also do a good job because sometimes we down the worng path way.In the college we should make daily list how to make our daily routine.If we have job we have a little time to be studying because we are tired when we back home . So we should make daily routine list . Today, we have many problems like county problems, diseases so on.So people have depression and money problem. So we must be do if we attended the college, we should be work part time jobs. In this country we don't have part time jobs. It's not good for college students. Above the mention, It's important for college students to have a part time jobs
