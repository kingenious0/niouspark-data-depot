"             I do agree.It is important for college students to have part-time job.If we,the students, have part-time job, we can make our own money and it can be less pressure for our parents.However,we need time to study for our school lesson. So sometimes we have to struggle.
            In Myanmar,  doing part-time job is not trend.In west countries,especially in European countries, most college students, have a part-time job.They support themselves. Having part-time job gives students job-experience.So it is also a good training.Therefore, every student need to have a part-time job. So that after the school,when we will be graduated,we will be ready to get a job and to work hard in the job. So I would like to say that it is also a key to succeed in life.Since we are in college, we can learn needed skills in the job.We can learn good behaviors, characters, leadership skill, time management,business management and so on.But we can not have the full course of skills. We can learn a part of skill from the seniors of every job-position. Since we have to deal with others form every position,we can also make to improve our soft-skill, an important skill.
              In conclusion,since doing part-time job can gives us essential skills to improve our daily life,if possible, we have to have a part-time job.Therefore I also agree this topic, importance of having a part-time job for college students."
