yes,I agree because some student want to study more but they have some financial issues. So they want to work part time job.Some students want more knowledge. They get some knowledge also. I think student have to work in part time job. They also know about surrounding knowledge. They become mature person. They can understand that how family are working for us. How they earn money. They know about hardwork. We should work part time job not only for need. It also do for our knowledge.It can be help us for our future. They got their life much improvement. It can understand about work. It can be help in their study. It is very important for college students to have a part time job. Whatever students needed it help through part time job. I suggest to college students they have to work part time job. It's good for students and their family also.Its help to know about people which person is good or bad. It's help students to know about people properly. They got much knowledge about work, people, road, etc. It's going to help students for study also. It's get more knowledge in study also.  They get more knowledge about places and surrounding office. Which office are working which product companies have providing. Which documents have to start our startup. How to start a business etc. They Got knowledge.
