  I, however, believe that smoking should be banned, but it should be done slowly and with proper planning and steps. Government should take serious action regarding this. Smoking is injurious to health.
First of all, smoking is severely detrimental to public health. It causes lung cancer which ultimately leads to death.  Once a person is addicted to smoking he/she will go any extent to complete his/her needs. Some of people start abusing their families and relatives. Smoking not only harms the smoker but also the people around them.
 Secondly, smoking is a complete waste of money, and addiction to smoking sometimes leads to enslavement to other illegal substances. 
But on the other smoking is making huge tax to the government and govt. use them in the betterment of schools, roads and other public properties.
The other advantage of cigarette is that the cigarette related companies   create a huge job opportunities and many  people got employment and many families can live a pace full life .
And we can say the last advanced of smoking which has been told by smokers is this smoking makes their mind fresh and make them more energetic to work and they came up with great idea after a good smoke.
So smoking has both advantages as well as disadvantages. But it should be banned in public areas and restaurants to make environment clean and healthy and breathable for all.
