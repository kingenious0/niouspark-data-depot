"A ban on smoking in all restaurants is important for keeping people healthy and making dining out enjoyable for everyone. When people smoke inside restaurants, the smoke can make others sick, especially workers who have to breathe it in all the time. By stopping smoking in restaurants, we can protect people from getting sick from secondhand smoke. This idea matches what many places around the world are doing to keep the air clean and safe.

Some people might say everyone should be able to choose whether to smoke or not, and that banning smoking in restaurants is too strict. They might also worry it could hurt restaurants' businesses. But it's more important to make sure everyone stays healthy and safe. Restaurants can find other ways to accommodate smokers, like having outdoor areas for smoking.

In short, banning smoking in all restaurants is a smart way to look after people's health and make sure everyone can enjoy eating out without worrying about breathing in harmful smoke.
All things considered, banning smoking in restaurants not only saves lives but also improves the environment, eating experiences, encourages healthy living, and shows social responsibility. It is an initiative that supports global efforts to make surroundings that are cleaner and healthier for everyone to enjoy.
