"I completely agree with the given statement that it is very crucial for college students to do some part time job along with their studies. The reason behind my agreement with the given notion are given below.

The first and foremost reason behind this is Independency. Students can become independent if they will do some work to earn money along with their studies. They will not have to depend on their parents to fulfil their little needs. In the modern era, children don't like to look at their parents' faces for some money because they  have to buy something for themselves. Thus, if students will do some job they can fulfil their needs on their own, they will become self confident too.

The second reason is the sense of responsibility. Students can become responsible if they will perform part time jobs while continuing their studies. Moreover, they can support  their parents with money. They can lessen the burden of their parents. This will also make them hard workers. They will learn how to handle work and their studies together. 

In conclusion, doing part time jobs not only make students independent, but also create sense of responsibility in them. Therefore, I completely agree with given notion."
