"smoking should be completely prohibited in all restaurants is the topic of discussion among people. some people think that is should not be banned and others think it should be banned and I agree with the latter view.

 First and foremost, the adverse health effects of smoking and secondhand smoke are well documented. By banning smoking in restaurants, we can create a healthier environment for both customers and employees. Non-smokers will no longer be exposed to the harmful effects of secondhand smoke, thereby reducing their risk of breathing problems and other related health problems. Furthermore, such a ban would discourage individuals from smoking, thus potentially helping to reduce the overall smoking prevalence in society.

 Additionally, a smoke-free restaurant environment will greatly enhance the dining experience. Its smoke and persistent odor can negatively impact meal enjoyment, atmosphere, and guest comfort. A smoking ban will promote a cleaner and more pleasant atmosphere, allowing customers to fully enjoy their meal without any unwanted distractions.

 Critics may argue that the ban undermines individual liberties; However, this concern must be balanced with the greater  public health benefit. Restaurants, as public spaces, have a responsibility to prioritize the health of their customers and employees. This view is reinforced by a growing awareness of the dangers of smoking and a social shift towards healthier lifestyles.

 In short, a complete ban on smoking in restaurants across the country is a step towards creating a healthier and more enjoyable dining experience for everyone. By protecting public health and promoting a cleaner environment, such a ban fits into the changing preferences of a society that values ​​well-being and quality of life.
