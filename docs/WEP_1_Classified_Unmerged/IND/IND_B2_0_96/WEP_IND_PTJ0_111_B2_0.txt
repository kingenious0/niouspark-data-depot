 I agree with the topic that the students need to do a part time job along with their studies. First, a part time job helps them to fulfill their basic needs including paying rent, paying bills, groceries and many more. Also, part time jobs help the students to enhance their skills like be punctual, communication skills, discipline because they take it as a responsibility to reach at workplace at time and they meet several people who belongs to different cultures that helps them to enhance their knowledge and communication skills. With the help of part time jobs, students start to support their family and they manage all their expenses by themselves. One of the main reasons is that sometimes students just concentrate on their work not on studies that is not good for them because study plays an important role for making their future bright and I think doing work in a limit is best for them. If a student has a part time job, they understand the value of money and try to save and don’t do any other expenses that are not worth for them. Due to college and job, students have hectic life schedules, so they don’t indulge in any other illegal activities. Students also get skills doing a job that helps them in future for securing a good job. So, I think doing a part time job helps in various ways to the student not only for managing expenses but also for secure a better job in future.
