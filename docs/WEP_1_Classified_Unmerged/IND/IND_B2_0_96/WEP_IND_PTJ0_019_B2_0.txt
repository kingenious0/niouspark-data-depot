In this cutting-edge era, it is vital to have a job as all individuals need money for survival, so I strongly agree with this statement that having a part-time job for a student is necessary in life. There are several reasons that having a part-time job for a student is necessary. Firstly, in all colleges students need to pay tuition fees and other charges, so students need work to pay their fees. For example, international students need to pay a higher amount of tuition fees, so by doing part-time jobs with study it will help in reducing the burden of paying fees. Another point worth mentioning is that as for International student, all of them need to pay monthly charges including rent or other expenses so it is crucial to get a part-time job. To illustrate it,  I am working as a part-time worker so it is easy for me to pay my rent and for groceries etcetera. Some students borrow money from banks and if scholars do not have part-time jobs it would be very difficult to pay back the borrowed loans. Furthermore, if students do part-time jobs then it would be very advantageous for them to get work experience.
