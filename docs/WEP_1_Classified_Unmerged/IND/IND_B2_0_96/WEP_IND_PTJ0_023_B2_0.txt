Yes, I totally agree with that college students should have part-time job because it not only helps them to be able to make money for pay their expenses but also helps them to gain experience to do work better in future. Moreover, it teaches them how to work in team, how to communicate with different kind of people, learn different kind of people attitude, their behave and how to deal with them. It enhances the knowledge of different culture if they have any co-worker belongs from different culture and enhance their communication skills. Apart from this, it also helps them  to teach them how to manage their school life and work life and teaches them to balance their life also with friends and family. Part- time work also make the person more active and energetic to learn something new except from study because physically work teach them a lot rather than books. It also tech them to be punctual because if they have school and work, they will try to work according to their schedule and do their work on time. Part-time work also leads to make them physically fit and may help them to be active to know what is ongoing on their surrounding because they must up and down daily. So overall, yes, it is more advantageous for students to have Part-time job.
