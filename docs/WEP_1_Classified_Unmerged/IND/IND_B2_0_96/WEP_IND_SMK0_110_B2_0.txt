I agree that smoking should be completely banned in all the restaurants in the country because there numerous disadvantages of it as smoking is dangerous for health. In restaurants people generally come with their families which include children and the smoking activities can led to a negative impact on children and they get influenced it and  there are chances that can they get indulged in the same activities because teenagers get influenced by what they see in their surroundings. Secondly, some people are suffering from diseases like asthma which is why  smoking in their surroundings can cause some health issues for them even, small children can experience some health issues due to these surroundings. Moreover, people in restaurants come to enjoy their meal in comfortable surroundings however, smoking in surroundings can ruin their experience. Even smoking can disrupt the environment of the restaurant which can cause trouble for the restaurant management. Government should make some legislation rules for the it so, that it should not create problem for the ones who are non- smokers and people with respiratory problems. Even there awareness campaigns should be held regarding smoking as it is injurious for health.
