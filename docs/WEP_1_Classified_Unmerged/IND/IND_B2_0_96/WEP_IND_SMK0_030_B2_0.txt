"I totally agree that smoking needs to be banned worldwide in all eating places. This action is required to safeguard the health and welfare of both customers and restaurant workers.
Smoking is, first and foremost, a serious health risk. It presents significant hazards to both active smokers and passive non-smokers who inhaled smoking inside their bodies. Restaurants are public spaces where people come to enjoy meals, and everyone deserves to breathe clean and healthy air. By banning smoking in restaurants, it helps to create a safer environment and prevent the harmful effects of passive smoke on nonsmokers.
Furthermore, the smell of smoke can be unpleasant for diners. No one should have to breathe tobacco smoke while eating. A smoke-free setting makes restaurants more enjoyable and welcoming.
An additional benefit of a smoking ban is that it would serve as a good example for the community, particularly for younger generations. To be more specific, even cigarette box contain instructions, ""Consumption of it injurious to Health"" which sends a clear message to smokers that smoking is dangerous and not socially acceptable when they observe smoking being forbidden in public places like restaurants. This can support the awareness of a healthier lifestyle and help lower overall smoking rates.
To conclude, banning smoking in restaurants protects health, enhances dining, prevents youth smoking, creating a cleaner and better environment."
