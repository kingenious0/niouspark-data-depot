Smoking is injurious to health always, but some people smoke every day and it becomes their habit. I agree with the statement that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants and there are various reasons of this, firstly, if smoking would be banned at all restaurants some people have an allergy to it so they will not face any kind of problem. Moreover, smoking is not good for health, and it will affect on lungs especially so avoiding smoking on restaurants is good. If smoking will be banned, it will create a healthier environment and be free from the bad smell of smoking. In addition to this, prohibiting smoking at all restaurants area would be making dining areas quite pleasant and people can enjoy the real taste of cuisines. Another worth mentioning point is that quitting smokers to stop smoking will also increase the number of healthy people in the world. Sometimes there are issues that we can see that due to smoking a huge fire generated and burnt whole buildings, so if smoking would not be banned at restaurants, then it will be dangerous for the area too. The smoking-free area would also be beneficial for family and their children, and it becomes a welcome space.
