"Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I agree with the point that smoking should be banned because 
Firstly, banning smoking in restaurants creates a healthier and more enjoyable dining environment. Non-smokers can now enjoy their meals without being exposed to harmful second-hand smoke. This is especially important for individuals who have respiratory conditions or allergies. It also ensures that families with children can dine in a smoke-free space, promoting a healthier lifestyle for everyone. Secondly, the ban on smoking in restaurants helps to improve air quality. Cigarette smoke contains harmful chemicals that can linger in the air and affect the overall ambiance of the establishment. By eliminating smoking indoors, restaurants can provide a cleaner and fresher atmosphere for their patrons. Additionally, the ban encourages smokers to reconsider their habit and potentially reduce or quit smoking altogether. By removing the option to smoke while dining out, individuals may be motivated to make healthier choices and prioritize their well-being.

In conclusion, smoking is the main cause of disease  and banning these type of product will help human to live a healthier live and also the level of death caused by cancer which is caused due to smoking . The main reason behind banning smoking is to save people lifes.
