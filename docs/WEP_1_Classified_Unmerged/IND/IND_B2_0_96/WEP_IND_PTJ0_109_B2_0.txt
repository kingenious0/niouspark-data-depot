I agree with the notion that college students should have a part-time job because of its existing advantages with reasons for college students. Firstly, it teaches students about how facing difficult situations which would ultimately give them knowledge regarding norms of life. For example, it would help them to know that how problems are handled in a very young age and enhance their problem-solving skills. Secondly, it make them independence and self-sufficient which makes them realize that they need to work to earn so that they can be recognized, fulfill their dreams and the value of money. Moreover, they can be responsible about things and manage their own expenses such as covering their fees without making their parents feel burdened. Lastly, doing part-time jobs enhance many skills that are useful in life practically such as cognitive skills, decision-making skills etc. giving them a experience of working under pressure with organizational and polishing their leadership qualities giving them exposure of new things and world which they are not aware of at the same time it doesn't mean if students are working full-time which w=can effect their studies badly.
