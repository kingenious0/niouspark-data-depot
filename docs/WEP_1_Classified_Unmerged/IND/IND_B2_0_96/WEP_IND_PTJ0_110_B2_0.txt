I agree that college students should have a part-time job because there are numerous advantages and reasons for it. The major advantage of having a part time job for college student is that they can earn money while studying because they have lot of expenses to pay and they can pay their expenses by themselves and be independent. Secondly, when the students work, they get a lot of life experience which they can use in future for better opportunities. The other reason that they should have a part time is that have some spare time and they can utilize that time to earn for running their household and even, some students don't have financial support which is why they they can earn from part time jobs and pay college fees by themselves and can support their families Moreover, experience of these part- time jobs  help them to get greater opportunities for future and after completing their studies they will be not unemployed as they can their part-time job to full time. Incase, The students start to work full time, they won't be able to focus on their studies and this can result as a major loss for them, moreover, there are chances that they could fail in the studies due to their full time job.
