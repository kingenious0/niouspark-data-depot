as per as my perspective smoking should be banned at restaurants in the countries. there are a lot of reasons behind it first of all, smoking is very harmful to our health not only for smokers but also for non-smokers because it releases toxins that are detrimental to health. and if smoking is allowed in restaurants, it becomes really hard for the employees who work in the restaurant, and they are more prone to health diseases. if the restaurant is smoke-free people enjoy it, they are meals with their families without any concern and they can enjoy the environment of the restaurant. non-smoking restaurants are also beneficial in the prospect of business because if people allow for smoking, then nonsmokers not visit the restaurants because they cannot compromise their health if the restaurants are smoke-free more and more people are attracted towards restaurants especially those who are health conscious. which enhances the economy.  smoke-free area also enhances work productivity. because employees of restaurants as second-hand smokers are more prone to health hazards due to this they are mostly on the leaves so if the area is smoke-free they can work efficiently.
