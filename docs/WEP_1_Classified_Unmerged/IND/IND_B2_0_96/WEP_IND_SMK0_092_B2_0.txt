"I agree that all places in the country should not allow smoking at all. This kind of action would be very good for public health and make eating better for everyone. First, making places smoke-free would protect people who don't smoke from the harmful effects of smoke. There are many harmful chemicals in smoke that can make people sick, especially if they already have breathing problems or are a child whose lungs are still growing. A smoking ban would also make the restaurant cleaner and more comfortable for customers. More people, including families and people who just prefer smoke-free places, would go to restaurants that don't allow smoking. This could bring more people into places and make the experience healthier and more fun for them. A ban on smoking in restaurants would also be in line with attempts around the world to cut down on tobacco use and improve public health. Many other countries have already put in place similar bans, which have led to fewer people smoking and better health results for their populations as a whole. In Conclusion, smoking is not allowed in any restaurant. This is an easy but effective way to protect public health and make restaurants safer and friendlier for everyone. Because of this, I fully back putting such a ban in place across the whole country.
