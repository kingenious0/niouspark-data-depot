"To find a part time job is very important for  most of the students to cover their monthly expenses ,however some people are privileged so there families provide them money but ,most of them need jobs .so,  i agree with the given statement that it is crucial to have part time job in students life.

To begin with, as I told the students have to do part time jobs in there college life to cover there daily expenses like food, travelling and college fee. not only, this some students took huge loan from banks to pay their college fees at first and now they have to pay that money in monthly installments so they can clear their loans.

Also, these small part times jobs teach them important life lessons such as time managing ,value of money and to get them prepared for the upcoming job experience they have to face in future .

However these jobs are some demerits to such as students get too involved in their part time jobs that they started to give preference to jobs rather then the studies with that they ignore their college work or they have no time to do that because they are doing overtime. 

To conclude ,Part times played an vital part in every students life and taught them important life  lessons .however student should giver preference to study not their work so they can complete  their study with flying colors and achieve their goals."
