Yes I am agree with the above statement that college students have an authority to work as a part time. The supporting reason behind my agreement is that student can get more knowledge while doing the work related to their study. For example, being a student of marketing I am doing a job in a shopping complex where I am using the things that I learn in my diploma course as I learned the thing to attract the customers by showing the products on display and also giving the customers best offers by providing discounts. even this also helps a person to be engaged with the foreigners and make an understanding better about their living preferences. Moreover, with the aid of part time job student can manage their expenses of living, food and other utilities only with the earning they have from their part time job. Ultimately, I would like to put  this above information in the favour of doing the part time job which is not beneficial on the basis of monetary also it has some other utmost qualities that can only ne earned while involving in the practical way.
