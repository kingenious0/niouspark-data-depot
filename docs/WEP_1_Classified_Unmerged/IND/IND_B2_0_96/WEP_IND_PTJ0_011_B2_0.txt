Students and part-time jobs Many students have different opinions about get part-time jobs and are wondering whether they should get part-time jobs or not. While some people think that part-time jobs will give them loads of benefit as students being, others see this as a burden and claim that doing a part-time will somehow do more harm than good. For whatever the opinions, I firmly believe part-time jobs are more advantageous in students' life due to a number of reasons. Some people argue that a part-time job may influence students' academic performance. Many people praise part-time work saying it contributes to the transition from childhood to adulthood. They believe that students have only a duty of studying in college; therefore, students who take part-time jobs may not have enough time left to do the assignments sometimes or feel tired to study. However, students can balance working with studying in order to not only earn money but also study well.  Students cannot usually be employed more than 20 hours per week or their grades begin to suffer, they do less homework, and they are more likely to drop out which seems as a negative impact on students. Taking all things into consideration, the positive effects far outweigh the negative effects. In conclusion, part-time jobs is inevitably very essential for students as part-time jobs not only giving students practical exposure to the real world but also providing them financial support as well as better opportunity to be able to compete in a labor market. Having a part-time job has become very popular amongst students today, and I being employed with a part-time job truly believe that there is no wrong in having a part-time job at all.
