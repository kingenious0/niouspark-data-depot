According to me, I am totally agree with the given statement because it is very important for student to work for their monthly expenses. Such as rent, Transportation expense and grocery. Moreover, With the part-time job, student might save money for their future expenses. It also help to student for reduce their stress and homesickness as student feels that they have source of income and in any emergency, they can freely spent on themselves. Part-time job is satisfaction for the student and play an important role in student life. It also helps student to balance work-life and student-life as they have more time to complete their assignments and other personal tasks than full-time workers. This type of jobs give opportunity to student for develop their skills like as communication, collaboration and time management. In future, It helps to get jobs in multiple national companies and other well firms. For example, In last year, the number of student got their dream jobs in good companies due to effective communication and other skills which they improved through their part-time jobs.
