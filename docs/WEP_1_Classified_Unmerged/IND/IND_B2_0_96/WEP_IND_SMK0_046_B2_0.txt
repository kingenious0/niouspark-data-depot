"Whether Smoking should be banned in restaurants or not has become a topic of debate. I believe that government should totally ban smoking in all restaurants across the country and reasons behind my opinion will be explained in upcoming paragraphs.

To commence with first reason, smoking is bad for everyone's health. Even if an individual doesn't smoke, being around smokers can harm him/her too. secondarily, smoke can lead to breathing problems, heart issues, and even cancer. By saying no to smoking in restaurants, we're looking out for the health of both customers and the people who work there.

Moreover, people go to restaurant for enjoying meals with loved one however smoking spoil their time as non-smoker finds it uncomfortable. Getting rid of smoking would make restaurants smell better and more comfortable for everyone, especially for those who don't smoke.

In addition, lots of folks want to quit smoking, but it's really hard, especially when they see others doing it. If restaurants are no-smoking zones, it might help some smokers kick the habit. Without the temptation to light up, they could take a step toward quitting for good.

Additionally, many people, like families and health-conscious folks, avoid places where smoking is allowed. If restaurants go smoke-free, more customers might come in, and that's good for business. Even, when young people see adults smoking in public places, they might think it's okay and start smoking too. By banning smoking in restaurants, we're telling everyone that smoking isn't cool or acceptable. This helps protect young people from picking up a habit that's really harmful.

To sum it up, I believe that banning smoking in all restaurants is the way to go. It helps keep people healthier, makes restaurants more pleasant, supports those who want to quit smoking, boosts business, and safeguards young people's health. "
