Smoking should be prohibited at all the restaurants in the country. I strongly agree with this statement. Smoking in public areas has severe health risks and environmental impacts which needs to be addressed. Research says that the people who go through passive smoking have higher risk of getting exposed to cancer than people who smoke. Passive smoking is where one inhales the air exhaled by an individual who is smoking. The harmful carcinogens released into the air are hazard to the lungs of the passive smokers. And since restaurant is a place where a lot of people sit together in a closed space, there is a very high chance of passive smoking. Thus, smoking in a restaurant exponentially increases the deteriorating effect that it has on the health of individuals. In addition to the health risks, smoking also releases harmful oxides in the air that have detrimental effect on the environment. The level of air pollution is exacerbated along with the ozone layer depletion, increase in global warming, and also acid rains. Since restaurants are pervasive over the country, prohibiting smoking contributes heavily in regulating the harmful effect it has on the environment. Restaurants are places filled with individuals in closed spaces, thus making it a vulnerable area for people to go through passive smoking. Thus banning it would reduce the exposure that passive smokers have along with contributing in limiting its harmful effect on the environment.
