"In this cut-throat era, the problem of smoking in public areas has taken a lead over all the problems. It becomes very essential to completely ban smoking at restaurants in the nation. I completely agree with this notion and in the forthcoming paragraphs, I will explain why? 
To commence with, there are several reasons for banning smoking in restaurants and places where people eat. First and the foremost reason is that, as it completely spoils the mood of all the individuals who are sitting in the restaurants. Sometimes, individuals have an allergy to the smoke and it appears to be worst when anyone smokes while eating as smoking is very injurious to health. So, it will result in health-related issues also. Moreover, many families visit restaurants with their children, so if someone smokes at that place, it causes severe health concerns to the juveniles. Restaurants are the places where people gather to enjoy, socialize and relax. Allowing smoking in these areas creates an unpleasant environment for non-smokers. It is becoming a global trend to avoid smoking in public places or in restaurants. In many places, there are legal restrictions also on smoking in restaurants. It will be good if smoking could be completely banned in these areas. In this way, people could enjoy meals in a healthier environment with their family members and with juveniles.
