"it is clearly seen that it is very crucial to do a part-time job for a college student, however, i agree with this statement. in the upcoming paragraph, i shall put forth my opinion in support of my argument 
                                                                                                                                                                                    the first and foremost reason is that college student has a lot of fees of their studies and also many other expenses to explain it , all of college students are young blood they do not want to rely on their parents for the money to fulfill their needs so they do part-time jobs so that they can fill their college fees by themselves and also do many other expenses without asking money from their parents for example, a recent survey conducted by an eminent researcher at Stanford University of California has found that more than 65.67% college students are doing part-time jobs to fill their fees and reduce their burden on their parents.                                                                                                                                                                  

the another reason is that college student can develop different types of skills by doing part time jobs during their study, as many college student choose skilled job as part time as a result they can get better jobs in the future also with the help they can build experience and get better jobs in the future 
in conclusion the statement that it is very important to do the part time jobs is appropriate
