	A smoking ban in restaurants is crucial, first and foremost, to protect the general public's health. The health of non-smokers can be negatively impacted by second-hand smoke, a result of smoking that contains several hazardous substances. By enforcing a prohibition, we may shield staff members and customers at restaurants from the hazards of passive smoking, lowering the possibility of respiratory ailments and other health issues. This action is consistent with the duty of the government to put the welfare of its people first.
Additionally, such a prohibition will considerably improve the hygienic conditions in restaurants. Smoking frequently results in the buildup of cigarette ash and used butts, which contributes to an unhygienic and unattractive environment. A smoke-free rule would produce a cleaner eating environment, encourage cleaning, and improve everyone's overall dining experience.
A smoking ban will also enhance the whole eating experience. Both smokers and non-smokers may find it difficult to enjoy food and beverages due to the smoke's presence and persistent odour. Restaurants may provide a more enjoyable and rewarding experience for all customers by removing this cause of discomfort, boosting client satisfaction and loyalty.
Although individual rights are significant, they shouldn't take precedence over the society. Smoking is universally accepted to be a serious health risk, necessitating some regulations to safeguard the public from its harmful consequences. It is vital to strike a balance between individual freedom and the larger goals of public health.
In conclusion, the nationwide ban on smoking in all restaurants is an action that puts public health, hygiene, and the quality of the eating experience first.
