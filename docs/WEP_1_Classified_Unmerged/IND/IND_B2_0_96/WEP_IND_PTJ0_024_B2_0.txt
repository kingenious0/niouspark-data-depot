"It is very important to have a part-time job during college life. Because every student has to pay the fees for next semester and also buy things such as glossary and many more. Most of the students are from another country. For example, most of the students in my class are from India and most of the students were unable to pay the full fees if they have to pay the full fee then they have to work hard during their studies. Then they are able to earn money and then they are able to pay the full fee. In addition, every student does not belong to a rich family they also have to support their families in previous countries. for example in India most of the students belong to middle-class families but in Canada and other countries, when these students come they have to work hard to fulfill their needs and also they have to send money to their parents, brother, sisters, relatives, friends and many more. To do all these things, the students have to do the job like part-time jobs. Some of the students do work during night shifts and some students do their jobs in the evenings and the students have to survive in different countries then they have to earn a lot of money to fulfill their needs.
