According to me, I will agree with this statement that smoking should be banned and  restricted for all the people in the world as it make main issue with the people health and most of the person are seen that they are doing smoke in the public places and other persons also have ot face the helath issues and also this will effect personal relationships of the people. Also, when mother is pregnant and her partner or she is smoking than it will be a severe effect on child health and the baby can born with lots of abnormalities and rare diseases. As in restaurants its completerly ban  by the government and will be a cause of fire if anyone is doing so. Also, most incidents happen such as major fire at gas station due to smoking and this takes lives of most of the people. Although, if people are stopping to smoke in public and private places then the smokers are getting agggressive and violent on them rather than understaing it as a personal responsilibility. But on this consequences this will show economic effect of the country as 90% people are smokers of any country and this will stop many of buisness if they ban the smoking in the country.
