 I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. smoking poses serious health risks to both smokers and non-smokers, but it also creates a bad environment for diners. By implementing a ban, we can protect the health and well-being of restaurant staff and customers, as well as promote a clean and enjoyable dining experience for everyone. Additionally, a smoking ban would encourage smokers to consider quitting or seek alternative smoking areas. It would also create a healthier image for the restaurant industry. A smoke-free environment would attract more customers, including families and individuals who are sensitive to secondhand smoke. Moreover, many countries have already implemented smoking bans in public places, including restaurants, to comply with health regulations and protect the general population. Non-smoking patrons deserve to enjoy their meals in a clean and fresh environment without being exposed to the smell and toxins associated with smoking. Overall, implementing a smoking ban would showcase the restaurant's commitment to promoting health and well-being. A smoking ban would protect employees and customers from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke, reducing the risk of respiratory issues, heart disease, and other health problems
