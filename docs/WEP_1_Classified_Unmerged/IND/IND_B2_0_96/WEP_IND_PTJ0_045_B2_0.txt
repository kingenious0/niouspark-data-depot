"Agree 
I strongly support this statement because it can help them develop skills that are useful for their academic and personal growth. Also, college students have huge expenditures on their studies like books and any other materials which is only possible to manage while working in this inflation period. In this way, they can help their parents in managing their expenses and not become a burden on them. Even they can earn and live a better life on their own. Working in a part-time job can help students improve their communication, teamwork, problem-solving, and time management skills. Moreover, these skills can benefit the students in various ways such as by improving their performance in classes, projects, and exams. It can help them prepare for their future careers by gaining relevant experience and networking opportunities. For example, working in a part-time job can help students work in a field related to their major or interest. They can learn from professionals and mentors who can guide them and inspire them. They can also build their resume and portfolio that can showcase their skills and achievements. Furthermore, they can make connections with potential employers and colleagues who can offer them advice, support, or referrals. Therefore, having a part-time job can help students explore different career options and paths."
