Smoking is injurious to health. Therefore, I believe it should be banned at all restaurants in the country. Nowadays, smoking is common among young people. It causes serious health issues for smokers and everyone who breathes in the smoke. First, smoking in restaurants has a negative impact on customers, including old people and children. People go to restaurants to relax so when they experience such an environment, they avoid going to restaurants. Hence, these should be banned to provide a healthy environment. Second, smoking not only degrades the quality of the eating experience for customers but also poses substantial health hazards to both smokers and non-smokers. Exposure to secondhand smoke has been linked to several health concerns, including respiratory illnesses and cardiovascular disorders, especially in young children and those with chronic diseases. As a result, preventing smoking in restaurants would greatly lower the likelihood of these health issues. Additionally, prohibiting smoking in public places is consistent with changing cultural expectations for public areas. More and more individuals are looking for smoke-free settings to enjoy their meals as knowledge of the risks of smoking and secondhand smoke continues to rise. By implementing a prohibition, we not only respect people's choices but also foster a more welcoming environment where people can enjoy their meals without being exposed to dangerous drugs.
