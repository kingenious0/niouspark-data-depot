"The idea of outright banning smoking is debatable because many individuals passionately favor it while others are opposed.  However, I think smoking should be prohibited but only after careful consideration and planning.
 First of all, smoking is really bad for everyone's health. Lung cancer is the result, which ultimately results in death. Second, smoking is a gross financial waste, and addiction to it can occasionally result in slavery to other illegal substances. Many addicts eventually engage in various criminal activities to manage the funds required to abuse illegal drugs. Finally, smoking is bad for both the smoker and those around them. Passive smoking may be just as dangerous as active smoking, according to recent studies on the subject. 
Despite this, the government receives a sizable amount of tax revenue from the cigarette business. By constructing public amenities that benefit common people, such as parks, schools, and roadways, the authority makes the best use of the tax money available. If smoking is entirely prohibited millions of individuals who work in sectors related to cigarettes will lose their jobs. Despite there being no scientific evidence to support it, some smokers feel that smoking helps them to release tension and stress. Last but not least, some people believe that prohibiting smoking is the same as limiting people's freedom.
In conclusion, I think the government ought to take action to rationally restrict smoking. A total smoking ban should be implemented gradually and with careful planning. Public smoking ought to be prohibited and anyone found in violation should face penalties."
