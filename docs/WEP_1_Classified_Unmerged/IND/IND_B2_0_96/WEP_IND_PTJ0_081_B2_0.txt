I strongly agree with this notion, because part time job is more important while your college study. In the behalf of international student it is more important to fulfill the requirement, because in canada living expenses are high if you are able to get a part time job than you might be successfull to achieve the all expenses. On the other hand some times student needs the some stationary and study material and these items price are also high and it is tough to purchase for the students, if they have not get a part time job. If you are a college student than you have a more expenses in the behalf of your social expenses, because you have a good friend circle and everyone wants get together with their friends. Although, this thing important to build the confidence of the student and they will be carried a good mind set in the future jobs, because they know about the difficulty of the jobs. In the point of view of parents they have no more burden of their children because fees are very high in these countries and parents have minimum earning, in this case part time job is good to collect a fees as well as their expenses. I am explaining the one live example of my friend their parents are not capable to paid their fees and when he did a part time job than he had paid the all fees independetely.
