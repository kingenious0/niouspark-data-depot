"I agree with the statement that it is for college students to have a part-time job. There are several reasons for agreeing to this topic because if a person is in college it means he/she is an adult and to earn money for their survival everyone should work rather than depending on their parents.
So according to me, the first reason for why it is important for college students to have part-time jobs is that jobs teach us a lot of things about the society we are living in as we encounter a lot of new people every day. Apart from that if a student is doing job along with their studies, it will make them work on two different things together, which will increase their multi-tasking skills and they learn to manage different things in their life. Moreover, a job gives a person very valuable experience which can never be earned through any other way, this experience can help the students to find a way in their life later on because some can make their career in the field if they like working in it, also if they want to directly enter any field after their study, then it would be very difficult for them to find a job without any working experience in a good company. 
To conclude, it could be said that college students should do some part-time jobs so that they can gain some valuable experience and also earn some money for their living."
