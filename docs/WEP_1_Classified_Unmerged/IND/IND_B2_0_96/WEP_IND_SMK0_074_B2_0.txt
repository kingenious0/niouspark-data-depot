"Smoking has both good and bad sides. Everyone will have a different point of view on it. As I will be sharing both views with you all. Smoking is a proven health danger, and secondhand smoke exposure can also be detrimental. Smoking bans in restaurants can protect the health of both customers and restaurant employees. Smoke-free restaurants tend to deliver a cleaner and more enjoyable dining experience. Smoking can cause unpleasant odors and residual smoke, which can negatively impact the whole experience for nonsmokers. Some say that smoke-free surroundings can attract a broader customer base, including nonsmokers and families with children who may be put off by the prevalence of smoking. Smoking bans in restaurants can safeguard restaurant employees' health and rights, as they may otherwise be exposed to toxic secondhand smoke. On the other hand some argue that adults should be allowed to make their own decisions, including whether or not to smoke, as long as it does not directly hurt others. There are fears that prohibiting smoking in restaurants will have a negative impact on businesses, particularly small enterprises, if smoking customers opt to dine elsewhere or if increased enforcement expenses result. Instead of a complete ban, some recommend that restaurants designate specific smoking places, allowing smokers to do so without disturbing non-smokers.
