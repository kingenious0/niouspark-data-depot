"I completely agree with this statement that part time job plays a vital role in college student life which means college student with a part time job during studies have more chances of personal, social, and financial growth which I will elaborate in upcoming paragraphs.

Firstly, let's talk about personal life a learner with part time job learns about time management like how to manage studies and work together which help to setup their mind to work in different situation and even they learn multi-tasking which help them in future professional life.
 
Secondly, it helps students to get real time or practical knowledge which help them lot in their academic life for example if someone like to take mechanical for future studies then they try to find work in car workshops to get some real-time knowledge about car engines and make them future ready.

Lastly, it is a very good side hustle because it makes students financially stable to some extent and they even know about the value of money in life and their way of spending change automatically after all this.

Overall, part time jobs are very good for college students for their overall well but the important thing to keep in mind is their priority which means they work but in some way that academic performance does not haul.
