I strongly agree with the idea of non-smoking area in all the restaurants. If the smoke is banned all around or inside the restaurants, nobody will smoke which will be fruitful for restaurants employees, customers to stay healthy. as getting smoking can be not only harmful for ourself but also for others. As people spend a lot of money to buy cigarettes. So if smoking will be banned, people do not spend money to buy cigarettes which will help them to save money. Besides this, it also reduces the health risks such as lung cancer. Moreover, it saves our environment from getting pollute. I think smoking is one from the major problem that really effects humans health. If it is prohibited all around, it can be helpful to increase life expectancy of human beings. Furthermore, it can save them from getting health risks such as high blood pressures, heart disease. One of the most compelling reasons to implement a complete smoking ban in restaurants is the significant health risks associated with secondhand smoke. Non-smoking patrons and restaurant staff exposed to these harmful substances are at an increased risk of developing serious health issues, including respiratory diseases, heart disease, and cancer. By allowing smoking in restaurants, we are essentially subjecting innocent individuals to potential harm against their will. Protecting public health should be a top priority, and a smoking ban in restaurants is a step in the right direction.
