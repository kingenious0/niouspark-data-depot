"I understand your perspective, but I have to respectfully disagree. While I acknowledge the negative health effects of smoking, I believe that a complete ban on smoking in all restaurants may not be the most effective solution. 

To begin with, instead, implementing designated smoking areas or creating separate sections for smokers and non-smokers could be a more balanced approach. This way, non-smokers can enjoy their meals in a smoke-free environment, while smokers still have the option to indulge in their habit. It's important to consider the rights and choices of individuals, as well as the potential impact on businesses. A complete ban might lead to a decline in customers for restaurants that cater to smokers, potentially affecting their livelihood. 

Furthermore, enforcing a total ban could be challenging and may require significant resources. In addition to this, instead, promoting awareness about the dangers of smoking and providing resources for those who want to quit could be more effective in reducing smoking rates. 

In conclusion, finding a middle ground that respects the rights of both smokers and non-smokers while addressing health concerns is crucial. It is about striking a balance that promotes a healthy and inclusive environment for everyone. "
