"i am extremely agree with the given statement if students allowed to do part-time or full-time work they can earn more and maximise their expenses .it is also important for the purpose of instituitional fees as in canada college or university fees is very expensive and alot of international students come from several nations for their bright future if government allowed students to work full -time or part-time they can pay off their college fees so with this they not only reduce the burden of their family or parents but also gain experience and knowledge of specific fields by doing more than one job.due to the inflation in the economy all the individuals are engaged in their work or jobs to fulfill the needs of their house members .
nowadays it is very difficult to manage all the expenses because all the things are very expensive almost in every nations. if a students have no job they might be engaged in bad activities such as consuming drugs ,alcohol ,etc.
moreover, a part-time job can help alleviate financial pressure on students and reduce the need for student loans or financial assistance. it allows students to earn their own income, cover expenses such as tuition fees, textbooks, and living costs, and gain financial independence.

additionally, a part-time job can enhance a student's resume and increase their competitiveness in the job market upon graduation. employers often value candidates with work experience, even if it's unrelated to their field of study, as it demonstrates initiative, adaptability, and a strong work ethic.

overall, while balancing work and studies can be challenging, the benefits of having a part-time job during college outweigh the drawbacks and can contribute significantly to a student's personal and professional growth."
