"I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are several reasons for that because smoking is injurious to health and passive smoking is also very dangerous for the person who doesn't smoke.
Firstly, restaurants are public places where every kind of person visits for food or for different parties, etc. In the restaurants, there are kids as well and even sometimes some sick people can also be present who may have some respiratory diseases, so it can be very dangerous for these people if they inhale the smoke even passively. Apart from that smoke creates a very bad smell and it can also ruin the whole air of the restaurant, which can lead to people start avoiding going to restaurants which affects the business itself. Moreover, there are several incidents recorded of fires because someone throws a lit cigarette on someplace with some fuel, so it is dangerous from that perspective as well. 
All in all, it can be said that smoking should be completely banned in restaurants because restaurants are public places and passive smoking could be life-threatening for other people. Also it is not good for the restaurant environment."
