In the last decades, the work environment has become fast-paced which has inclined the competition in society significantly. Due to this, the generation of today is expected to be good in all fields. According to me, doing a part -time job can help a lot in this situation. Some people think that doing the job while studying is a good thing, however, others disagree with this view.  I partially agree with this statement. I agree with the statement, in my opinion, working as a part-time worker helps learners achieve financial independence. In that way, they will no longer be dependent on their parents for money. Also, they will get confident. Working with a company helps students to meet people from different backgrounds, they face a lot of challenges which consequently make them self-sufficient as well as confident. Conversely, the students get low grades because they sometimes become unable to establish an equilibrium between work and study which not only affects their academic grades but also leads to mental issues because of depression faced in the guilt of not being able to achieve their goal. In summary, I can say that doing a part-time job has its own benefits but does have some destructive aspects as well that need to be considered.
