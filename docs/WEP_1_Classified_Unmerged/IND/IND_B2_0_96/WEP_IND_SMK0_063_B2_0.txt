Smoking is danger for person who smoke as well as another person who live with them. It leads to lung cancer. So, government should make a rules for smokers. It is completely banned in public place like restaurants, hotels and cafe. Major of person suffer from lung cancer. Smoking is equally detrimental effects for passive smoker who never smoke but live with active smoker. So, that's why I strongly agree with this statement. Another reason, pregnant women avoid to live with smoking person because it is dangerous for baby and also women will get defect baby. Therefore, government impose rule for smoker and banned in public area. Smoking is bad habit for person. Also, cigarette company write " it is danger for health and it leads to cancer". But personal have habit of smoking so under estimate this statement. Also, in Canada cigarette is to expensive. According to research, around 2 hr salary spend on cigarette and other smoking instruments. So, person have not enough money to spend for it. Apart from this, 80% get base pay which is around 14.15$.
