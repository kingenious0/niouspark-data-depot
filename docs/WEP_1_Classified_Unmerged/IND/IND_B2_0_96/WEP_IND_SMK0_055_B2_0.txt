In this contemporary era we can see a lot smokers around us. Some of them are even teens. I totally agree with this statement that smoking should be restricted at public hotels. The first and foremost reason is that smoking is injurious to health of smoker and also to the other person around them as the particals of the smoke dissolve in the air and when other persons inhale the same air they had to face some difficulties while breathing. However public places are the most common areas where people usually smoke such as bus stand hotels and others. Restaurants should prohibit smoking because their are alot of other people around them some time small toddlers teens and old people which may affect their health breathing the same air. Smoking puts devastating effect on the health of people but smokers waste huge chunk of money on buying these products whereas that money can also be used for charity purpose.in this suphosticated era it seems that some people are even sinking just for a trend of to show it off. So necessary laws should be made and also smoking must be banned at all the restaurants so that it may not affect any one's health.
