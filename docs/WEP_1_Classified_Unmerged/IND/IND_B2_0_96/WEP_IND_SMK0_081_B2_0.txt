I am agree with this statement, restaurants is a peaceful place where people go with their families as well as their friends and it is not good thing to smoking of people at that places. On the other hand, smoking is not good for a health, because smoking disturbed to the other people at the restaurants. In my point of view, restaurants is a place where people sit together and talked about their daily routine life, it is not matter it is related to the personal life or professional life. In this type of places people release the stress to take a food and drinks. In the restaurants all age people has come and it is not good for the children. I am sharing my personal experience last year i was gone to the restaurant with my family and one of the person continously smoking to next table and my aunt has a elergy from the smoke and she was feel bad due to smoke and we did not enjoy the dinner at that time, after that i talked to the manager and sot out this problem.
