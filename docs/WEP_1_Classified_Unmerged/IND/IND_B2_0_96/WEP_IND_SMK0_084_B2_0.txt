I'm partially agree to the give statement this is smoking should be banned in the cuntery. Firstly, smoking ban is seems like impossible as many people are used to it and they do it very often some of them think that smoking release the stress. Secondly, government has imposed the high taxes on the smoking products which help the government to get more money in term of taxes which help financially. Moreover, there would be job losses in the nation if the smoking is banned and there will be more conflict among the people to have a job. The last thing that will arise people will think that it's compromise with their freedom which would create the problem for the higher authorities. On the other hand it would be good if there is no smoking in the nation which will protect the people from various drug abuse. This will also promote the health of individuals, reduce the chronic respiratory diseases  as well as it would make the environment more clear and pure. Apart from that this will save the money of individuals who use to smoke.
