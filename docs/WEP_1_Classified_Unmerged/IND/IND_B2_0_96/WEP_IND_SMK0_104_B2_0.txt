I am totally agree  with given statement as smoking have great impact on the individual health. It would be great if smoking completely ban in the restaurants because every people come in restaurants for the enjoyment and spent lecture time. It not only impact on the smoker but also on the other people, who stand nearby them. It is very important to avoid this thing in the public places and government should take some actions to reduce this bad habit like as fine or ban. If people want to smoke, they can at their home or empty place rather than public places. Public safety is important and smoking have bad impact on the public. Moreover, some people might have health problems and other diseases and due to smoking their problem would be increase and risk of the death. So, government should aware the public about the smoking impacts and problem, which they will face in future like as cancer and heart diseases. I request to authority to take strike action to reduce the smoking the public places as other people can enjoy their time in the public places.
