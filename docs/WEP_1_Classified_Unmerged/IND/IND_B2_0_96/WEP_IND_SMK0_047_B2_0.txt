"Smoking has long been recognized as a significant public health concern due to its detrimental effects on both smokers and non-smokers. The debate over whether smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country is a topic of great importance. This essay argues in favor of implementing a nationwide ban on smoking in restaurants, highlighting the health, economic, and social benefits such a ban would bring.

First and foremost, a complete ban on smoking in restaurants would contribute to a healthier environment for both customers and employees. Secondhand smoke exposure poses serious health risks, including respiratory illnesses, heart diseases, and even cancer. By eliminating smoking in restaurants, the health hazards associated with secondhand smoke would be significantly reduced, leading to a healthier population overall.

From an economic perspective, banning smoking in restaurants would lead to several advantages. Healthier employees would mean reduced absenteeism due to smoking-related illnesses, thereby increasing workplace productivity. Additionally, healthcare costs would decrease as fewer people would be exposed to harmful tobacco smoke, resulting in reduced medical expenses for treating smoking-related illnesses. Moreover, restaurants could save on maintenance and cleaning expenses, as smoke-free environments are generally easier to maintain.

To conclude, it would be apt to say that higher authorities must take initiatives rationally to prohibit smoking all over the world. Even any violation of this rule should be penalized. "
