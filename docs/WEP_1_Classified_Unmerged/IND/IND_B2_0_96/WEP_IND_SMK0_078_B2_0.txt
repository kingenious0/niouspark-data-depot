"I wholeheartedly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Such a ban not only promotes public health but also creates a more pleasant and inclusive dining experience for everyone.

Firstly, smoking is a well-established health hazard. Secondhand smoke poses serious risks to non-smokers, including increased chances of respiratory diseases and even cancer. By allowing smoking in restaurants, we not only endanger the health of patrons but also expose restaurant employees to these harmful effects, as they must work in this environment daily. A complete ban would protect the well-being of both customers and workers.

Moreover, smoking in restaurants disrupts the overall dining experience. For non-smokers, the presence of cigarette smoke can be unpleasant and even intolerable. It diminishes the enjoyment of a meal and discourages families and health-conscious individuals from dining out. A smoke-free environment would make restaurants more appealing to a broader range of customers.

Furthermore, a comprehensive ban on smoking in restaurants aligns with global health trends. Many countries have already implemented such measures, recognizing the importance of safeguarding public health. By doing the same, our country would demonstrate its commitment to the well-being of its citizens.

In conclusion, a complete ban on smoking in restaurants is a necessary step to protect public health, improve the dining experience, and align with international standards. It is a policy that promotes the greater good and should be wholeheartedly supported."
