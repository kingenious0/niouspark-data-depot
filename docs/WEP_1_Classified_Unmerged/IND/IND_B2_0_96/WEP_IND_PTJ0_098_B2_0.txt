"There is no iota of doubt to say that part time jobs are very important for the college students. Due to this, I am agree with that and I will discuss this in my upcoming paragraphs.
To begin with, there are numerous aspects which reveals the information regarding the importance of having a part-time job for college students. The first and the foremost aspect is that the students need to pay a huge amount every month as there monthly expenses like their house rent, grocery, mobile bills, bus fairs and many more. owing of this, they are facing so many hurdles to survive in other nation with having a fix amount of money as a GIC( guaranteed investment funds) for their initial year as an International student. So, it is very important to doing a part-time jobs to manage their expenses. Moreover, students also need to pay an ample amount of money as their tuition fees for their next semester before due date to complete their studies. If they do jobs they can try and save money for their next semester tuition fee.
Moving further, Students can become hardworker and could gain a better skills as a part-time worker, that could also be beneficial for their future to get a higher paying jobs after their studies and to secure their jobs. To exemplify: last year "TIMES OF CANADA" has published an article, which illustrates about the successful businessman who got a skill while studying, and they settled their own business in future and now their future has been secured.
In conclusion, Although, part-time jobs has so many benefits for the students, they should not focus more on jobs instead of studies.
