" People often ask whether or not college students should continue part-time jobs with college classes. Many individuals believe that having a part-time job will impact their grades, but in my opinion, it can really benefit for students. It helps in their personal development, time management skills learning, and development of critical future skills. I will explain my point of view in subsequent paragraphs.
           To start with, if students get any kind of part-time job it can help them manage their expenses as well and college helps them to make better people in their lives and gain confidence. Moreover, students can meet new people in their daily lives and also talk with them which is useful for them to understand their daily activities. Additionally, dealing with issues in the workplace encourages students to learn about their abilities and weaknesses, leading them to make better decisions about their future career directions.
         Furthermore, it is important to learn time management skills. Students in college must manage their time around work, friends, and classes. Although it may look difficult, it teaches students how to plan their day, complete tasks on time, and maintain a regular routine. These abilities help them later on when they work a full-time position. For instance, I am an international student and am also doing a part-time job in SUBWAY which helps me to reduce my stress level and manage my time in my daily life, that's why the part-time job is most important for international students for career growth also.
       So having a part-time job while in college can actually be very beneficial. It encourages improvement in learners, encourages time management skills in, and provides them with essential future abilities. So, I believe that college students should seriously think about taking a part-time job.
