"In this 21st century, people most like smoking. At many public places such as airports, railway station, and parks, smoking are legal and the government makes smoking area for people who likes smoking. I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. This essay will discuss some points about smoking in restaurants.

Firstly, smoking must be completely banned at the restaurants in the company. Owing to the fact that a restaurant is a public place. People come there to eat in their leisure time or individuals like to spend their time in a peaceful and safe place in the restaurant. Children also come to the restaurant with their parents, so they have a bad influence. Because children will watch what they will do in the future. If they watch good things, they will do good things. If they will watch bad things, then they will do bad things.

Furthermore, smoking must be completely banned in all public places. In many countries, where people smoke more, the government makes smoking rooms for the persons who smoke. Smoking kills and it is clearly written on the smoke packet, but then also it is selling freely in the market. Smoking damages the lungs of people. Many people die at the age of 40 or 50 due to smoke.

To conclude, I could say that smoking must be completely banned and it must be banned for people who are under 30. The government should put some additional taxes on smoking, so it can be expensive and people stop buying the smoke.  "
