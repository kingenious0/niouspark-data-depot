Yes, I completely concur with this statement that a part-time job is necessary for college students because it will help them in their daily life expenses, and by having work they know the value of the money. Apart from this, they learn valuable things or knowledge and experience in their life. Moreover, they gain more practical knowledge than theoretical. In spite of these, they learn about the financial burdens that they have to experience in their future life and know how their parents earn money. they also learn the value of time. For instance, in the workplace, they have to be on time and if they get late there will be punishment for them that's why they go on time and perform all the tasks on time which the skill of time management. At last, they can build a friend circle and know to meet different people and know their religion and rituals.  However, some students might find it challenging to juggle both responsibilities, affecting their academic performance. So, while part-time jobs offer advantages, finding the right balance is key.
