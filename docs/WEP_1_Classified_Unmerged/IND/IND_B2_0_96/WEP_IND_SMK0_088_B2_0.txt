"I agree, that banning smoking in all restaurants across the country is a great idea because it keeps everyone healthier. When people smoke, the smoke can make others sick, even if they don't smoke themselves. This is called secondhand smoke, and it can cause serious health problems like breathing issues and heart disease. By not allowing smoking in restaurants, we make sure everyone can enjoy their meal without worrying about getting sick from someone else's smoke.

Also, lots of other places around the world have already banned smoking in restaurants, showing it's a smart move for public health. When restaurants are smoke-free, more people want to eat there, which can help businesses make more money. Plus, it makes dining out more pleasant for everyone, especially families and people who care about their health.

Lastly, by making all restaurants smoke-free, we're showing that we care about keeping people healthy and safe. It sends a strong message that smoking isn't good for anyone, and it helps protect people, especially kids and those with health problems, from starting to smoke in the first place. So, banning smoking in restaurants isn't just a good idea, it's a way to make sure everyone can enjoy their meals without worrying about the harmful effects of smoking.
