yes, I am in the Favour of the part-time job along with studies. because they can learn new things while working with different people. student can enhance their skills and confidence while working part-time jobs. apart from this, it is very difficult for every student to run their expense so while working part-time jobs they can stabilize their common expense with part-time jobs. after working a part-time job, they become independent, and students can learn how to become responsible which comes in immensely handy for them in the future. when students do work with their studies, they can learn how to manage their time they become punctual, and they can learn how to compile the task before the deadline. part-time work proves very beneficial for their upcoming life because while studying they know everything like they can know how to cooperate with others. if they are working while being a student, they can improve their communication skills and customer service which are highly imperative. due to the part-time job, they are able to make relations with the corporation. due to their experience of work, they have a lot of work opportunities to get well-paid jobs.
