"Yes I do agree with the given notion and the reason being that smoking involves an act of burning a substance for the purpose of taking in its smoke into the lungs. I am going to explain the reasons that why smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the nation
                  Firstly, smoking has substances, Tobacco and Nicotine which are injuries to health. Not on active smoking is harmful but passive smoking is also not good for the health. These two substances are absorbed by the lungs and a widespread technique through is done is via smoking. In restaurants if someone is smoking then it will effect another ones because anyone around them can develop cancers of lungs, mouth and throat and other sites of the body. It is not fair to impose this upon another person.
                   Secondly, the smell of smoke can be unpleasant and off putting for many dinners in restaurants. no one should endure the discomfort of inhaling tobacco smoke while having a meal. In restaurants it is hard to breathe if someone is smoking because few restaurants do not have ventilators to feel free to get breathe. 
To conclude, even there is ban on smoking but people do not regret to have smoking in the public places like bus stops, restaurants, hospitals and railway station because awareness is must to make people aware that what they are doing and they are having a big risk with their mental health also."
