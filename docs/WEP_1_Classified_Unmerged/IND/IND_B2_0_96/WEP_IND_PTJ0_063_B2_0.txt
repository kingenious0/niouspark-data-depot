I strongly agree with this statement. In canada, most of student get only 20 hour part time job. It is very crucial for each and every international students who immigrate from another country like India, China, and many more. After come in Canada as a student, they have to spend lot of money for house rent, grocery, other personal belongings as well as fees. So, that the reason, Student need money and it is get from their part time jobs. In addition to this, some students are belongs from rich family but major of students (70 to 80%) are come from middle class. It is main reason, if student have a great part time job. Therefore, they do not need to borrow money from their parent and other family member. For example, student do a part time job around 20 hr per week and they get approximately 1000$ or more.  They live peace fully in Canada. Also, some students save money from that and transfer money to their parent in back home for any help. As well as, student become an independent in their early adulthood. They start to value of money and they feel like how their parents get money. Apart from this, they make a expenses dairy and mention all things where they spend dollar. I believe that, it is crucial for student as well their family.
