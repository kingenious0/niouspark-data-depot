"yes i totally agree with this statement. learners should have part time job to pay their fees and better liveliness from other who work only at one job it is all about fees that they all should have to pay by their own. it is very difficult for the students who are far from their parents to earn and save money for their fees while doing a single job which is not good their career as they all have to pay fees and to pay their next semester fees they all should be financially strong and it would only happen they do art time jobs. 

Having part time jobs also has some negative effects on their physical body as their body didn't get proper rest and complete their sleep which may effect their studies and make problems while learning about their assignments and learning articles. By doing part time jobs they learn new things from their colleagues and learn about their culture and their language and make us away from bad circle if they are busy in their work and make good friends and learn something new from them .It will  help them in making their career life better."
