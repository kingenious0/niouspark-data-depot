"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. This is because smoking is harmful to both smokers and non-smokers. People who are close to who come into contact to indirect smoke, or air from another person's cigarette, face serious health problems.
Restaurants are public places where lot of people come together, including families and those who do not smoke.  People could feel safe against the dangers of indirect smoke when smoking was prohibited in public places like restaurants. Furthermore, it could make the natural world better for everybody, but particularly for people who have problems like asthma.
Smoking may also affect the taste of food and your dining situation.  Smoke smell may continue and make eating outdoors more difficult for customers.  Restaurants could boost the environment for all customers by banning smoking.
A ban on smoking in restaurants may encourage smoking to reduce their consumption lower or stop completely.  It might improve individual medical conditions and reduce the strain for the health care system. 
In the end, a complete smoke ban could enhance the eating experience, create  a more healthy the environment, protect non-smokers from indirect smoke, and defend smokers from third-party cigarette smoke. It's an achievement in the right direction of a more friendly and safe community for all people.
