I totally agree with this statement as a part-time job is very important for college students. Although it becomes a thing of a burden on the students to continue studying as well as work still it has some benefits as it helps the students to meet their daily expenses. It can reduce the burden on the parents when students support their parents. Moreover, students can achieve work experience which can build their resume for future careers. It is also a good source to improve their communication skills. students can save and earn money. They can also learn about time management when they make and follow a schedule of study as well as their work which also gives a chance to create good connections between people. It broadens the knowledge and skill of the students which helps in building a good career. As hard work is the key to success, students can get better living opportunities and health benefits from their work which helps them in life. Students also come to know about teamwork, leadership qualities, and organization from working with different people.
