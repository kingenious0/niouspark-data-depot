I totally agree with this statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.Because in every country these days most youngsters are becoming addicted to smoking and they are unable to leave this addiction. In the survey, it is noticed that In  2020, only 15% of the people were addicted to different smokes but by the passing days the counting of addictions increased continuously because most of their friends wish to affect their friends because they want to have a party with their friends. most of the school students wish to do smoking when they see movies their favourite celebrities .when the celebrities promote the smoking then the youngsters wish to follow their favorite actors. In addition, the newcomers are unaware of the effects of these smokes. Because some of the drugs are lethal to health. so many dangerous diseases may occur such as cancer. In the survey in 2023, it was noticed by the World Health Organization that more than 70% of smokers are died due to the addiction to smoking and more than 40% of the addictions face cancer problems. So smoking should be banned from all countries to aware the new youngsters of all countries
