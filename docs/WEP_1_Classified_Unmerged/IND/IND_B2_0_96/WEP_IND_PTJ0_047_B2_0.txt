"Students usually prefer to do part time jobs during their college days to pay their fees or for daily survival which is accepted by few communities, while opponents totally against with this view. As per my opinion, I accord with this aspect as pupils get opportunities during their college day they get more benefits which will be explained in upcoming paragraphs.

First of all, most of students face financial obstacles which prevent them to move forward in  their studies, through this employment opportunity they become able to cover their tuition fees and living expenses along with their education. Consequently, this approach give chance to capable students to concentrate more on their studies without constant financial worries. Moreover, learners become more responsible when they manage studies and work together, this makes them versatile in young age.

Furthermore, part time employment equips students with practical skills that are often overlooked in schools or colleges where students only get engaged to complete syllabus, 
 these skills are time management, rules and regulations, communication skills and problem solving skills which contribute to a well rounded education. For more clarification, this struggle assist them to search full time employment after completion their studies as they are already prepared to adopt work culture and have working experience. 

To conclude, as per my perception, this approach must continue in student life as this is win-win situation for pupils, through this they obtain meaningful experience during their academic progress and become independence in young age."
