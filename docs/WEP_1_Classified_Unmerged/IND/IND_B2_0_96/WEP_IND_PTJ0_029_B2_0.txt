"In today's higher education landscape, the debate over whether students should pursue part-time work has gained considerable momentum. Although some people think that  part-time work can affect academic performance, I really believe that  part-time work is very important for students. Experience gained, skills honed, and lessons learned from balancing work and study can make a significant contribution to a student's personal and professional growth.

First, a part-time job offers valuable real-world experience that textbooks and courses cannot provide. Engaging in a job related to one's field of study can provide practical insights and help students connect theoretical concepts with their practical application. In addition, part-time jobs also promote responsibility, time management and discipline, which are necessary skills in life. Students learn how to organize shifts, assignments, and tests, improving their ability to  manage competitive demand effectively.

Second, the financial aspect cannot be ignored. Higher education comes with a significant financial burden, including tuition, books, and living expenses. A part-time job can ease this burden somewhat, reducing the need for excessive student loans and potential debt after graduation. In addition, students who contribute to their own education tend to develop a stronger sense of belonging and a determination to excel academically.

In conclusion, the idea that students should get  part-time jobs is reasonable and beneficial. Experience gained, financial support, and skills developed make part-time employment an important part of the full college experience. By seizing this opportunity, students are better equipped to meet real-world challenges while enriching their learning journey."
