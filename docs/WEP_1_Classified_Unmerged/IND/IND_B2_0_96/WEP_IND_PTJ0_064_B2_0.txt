I completely agree with this statement because the part-time job is crucial for students since it encourages activity, provides learning opportunities, and allows them to make some extra cash. When students work part-time jobs in addition to their studies, they are able to make the most of their free time. Students, for instance, are not always able to keep themselves occupied. They occasionally take some downtime for recreational activities. Some students find it monotonous to spend more time in their free time. They begin to take a job in order to fill their free time in order to get rid of their bored feelings. As a result, they become more engaged in daily activities and show greater concern for their academic performance. A student may gain some experience through a part-time job occasionally. It is true that everyone should gain experience in their intended field before accepting a permanent position or a significant job. For instance, before graduating from college, students may receive offers for internships. This internship serves as a form of part-time job that helps students get experience in the workforce. The most lucrative option for students is pocket money. Students who work a part-time job occasionally don't need to seek their parents for financial assistance because they can make some money on their own. Students who accept a part-time job should stick with it so they can earn in three different ways. In the end, they will become more productive, efficient, and perfect in their future lives.
