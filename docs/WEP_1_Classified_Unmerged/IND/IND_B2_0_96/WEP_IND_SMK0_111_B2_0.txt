I think smoking should be completely banned in restaurants because it is not good for your health. I think in the restaurants there are several people who come and not all the people have smoking habits so sometimes other people have some health issues from the smell of smoke so that they feel uncomfortable. Everyone knows that smoke contain serval chemicals these are toxic and cause serious health issues like heart disease, cancer and respiratory .If the smoking is banned then it is beneficial to promote healthy environment .On the other side , to completely banned the smoking may argue on the individual freedom because every person have a right to do everything which they want to do but we need to create  balance between the human rights and other people who donâ€™t smoke .We need to aware the people about the harmful effects of the smoking through social media, advertising and many other ways , may be by doing this people try to quit this bad habit. Restaurants need to create a policy and prohibit smoking for the safety of their staff members. I think not only in restaurants but also at all public places, smoking should be banned. Some time when children see others as they are doing smoking, they try to do this and as per time children also become addicted that may cause different problems for the society in the future.
