"I really believe that smoking should not be allowed in any restaurants in our country. This means people wouldn't be allowed to smoke inside any restaurant.

The main reason is that smoking is not just bad for the person doing it. The smoke also hurts others who breathe it in. This is especially risky for people who work in restaurants and customers who don't smoke. By making a rule against smoking in restaurants, we can make sure everyone stays healthy.

Besides, if people can't smoke in restaurants, the air inside will be much cleaner and nicer. People who don't smoke won't have to smell or breathe in the smoke while they're trying to enjoy their meals. This will make going to restaurants a lot more enjoyable for everyone.

Nowadays, a lot of people are trying to be healthier, and not letting people smoke in restaurants is a step in that direction. Some people might worry that this takes away their choice to smoke, but they can still do it in other places where it's allowed.

To sum up, I really think it's a great idea to stop smoking in all restaurants. It will help keep everyone healthier and make eating out a better experience. It also goes along with the trend of making healthier choices in our lives."
