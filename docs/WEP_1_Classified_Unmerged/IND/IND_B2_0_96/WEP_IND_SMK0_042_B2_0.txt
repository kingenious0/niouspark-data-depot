"I am in agreement with this topic as smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country as it causes various problems  for these reasons:
It causes serious health hazards. It causes serious breathing problems such as smoking from the cigarette  which enters in the lungs infection and  can cause death sometimes as it becomes very difficult for the patient to survive for a long time.
Regular use of smoking in public places like restaurants can cause various problems. It also increases the chances of heart attack which proves to be very dangerous. As life is very precious, once gone can never be again, so people should live and enjoy their life happily
Moving ahead, regular use of smoking also cause cancer problems as the smoke enters into the air and has bad effect on health and body not only for the smokers but for others also . 
Smoking can spoil the environment, it also has a bad effect on the breathing system.

To conclude I can say that smoking at public places is very dangerous for the people not only for the smokers but for others also as everyone took a breath from the dusty air.
