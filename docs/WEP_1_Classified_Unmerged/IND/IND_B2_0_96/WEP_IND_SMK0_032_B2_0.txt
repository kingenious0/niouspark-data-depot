"I agree with the given statement that in restaurants, smoking should not be allowed at all in the country. The reasons why I agree with this statement are mentioned below.

The first reason is that smoking at public places like restaurants is not only bad for the person who is smoking but it also affect the other people badly. As all know, smoking is injurious to health. At the restaurants, there are children, pregnant women, old age people. Smoke of cigarettes can be very dangerous for them. They can have health issue like breathing problems, cough. This can lead to serious health issues. So, it's very bad thing to smoke at restaurants.

The second reason that use of cigarettes should be banned at restaurant is that restaurants are mostly closed from all sides. Although it has windows but still they are not very open. When people smoke there, it's hard for the smoke to go out and it becomes suffocating for people. Moreover, smell of smoke is very unpleasant. It can be difficult for people to breathe over there. It took very long for the smell to be removed. So, it can put bad impact on the customers which can further lead to reduce in number of customers.

In conclusion, Although some people find it pleasant to smoke, but at public places, it can be unbearable for other people. So, I completely agree with the given notion."
