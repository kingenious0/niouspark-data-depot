Smoking is one of the most common problems we have today that is killing people. Many people develop this habit as a result of stress, personal troubles, and other factors. In fact, some even start advertising it. When a person smokes, they harm not only themselves but also those around them.with the idea that smoking needs to be totally banned in all restaurants across the nation. I recognize that smoking has health hazards and that it is important to create smoke-free spaces, but a total prohibition might not be the best option. It might be more practical to build devoted smoking areas or give smokers access to outside sitting. As long as it doesn't affect the health and rights of non-smokers, it's important to take smokers' rights and choices into account. It may be more inclusive to strike a balance between accommodating both groups. However, creating sufficient breathing space and implementing restricted systems might lessen the negative effects of secondhand smoke on non-smokers. In the end, solving this problem requires finding a middle ground that respects the rights and wellbeing of everyone involved.
