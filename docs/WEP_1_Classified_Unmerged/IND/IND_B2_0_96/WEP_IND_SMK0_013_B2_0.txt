I completely agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Smoking is a dangerous habit that can have serious health consequences, not only for smokers but also for those around them. Secondhand smoke can be harmful to people who are exposed to it, and it can be especially dangerous for people with respiratory problems like asthma. In addition to the health risks associated with smoking, it can also be unpleasant for non-smokers to be around people who are smoking. The smell of smoke can be unpleasant, and it can ruin the dining experience for people who are trying to enjoy a meal. Furthermore, banning smoking at restaurants can help to create a healthier environment for everyone. When smoking is allowed, it can be difficult for non-smokers to avoid exposure to secondhand smoke. Mostly little baby and adults aslo go to the restaurent, if the environment is smoky then it can be so dangerous for then, especially for little babies and can effect their lungs. By banning smoking, restaurants can create a safer and healthier environment for their customers and employees. Overall, I think that banning smoking at all restaurants in the country is a good idea. It can help to protect people from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke, create a more pleasant dining experience for everyone, and promote a healthier environment for all.
