"Smoking is a very popular activity nowadays. People irrespective of their age are easily addicted to smoking, but smoking should be restricted through legal authorities or by the government through high taxation and reduction in productivity by imposing heavy taxes and license requirements. It should be completely banned in restaurants because there are people who do not smoke and it would be difficult for them to eat there. Everyone benefits from a healthier environment when smoking is prohibited in restaurants and public integrational places. There are major health hazards associated with smoking, such as an increased risk of cancer and respiratory problems. Canada should be proactive in preserving the health of its people by preventing smoking at these facilities. Moreover, prohibiting smoking in restaurants helps non-smokers to prevent their food from intoxicating in air. Everybody should be able to enjoy a meal without having to deal with the harmful effects of secondhand smoke. A smoking ban might, from an economic perspective, draw more smokers to protest. People who don't smoke might be more likely to frequent places that forbid smoking since they are worried about breathing in smoke.
