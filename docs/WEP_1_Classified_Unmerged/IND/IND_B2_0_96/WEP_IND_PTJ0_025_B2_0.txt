I completely agreed with the given topic. As an international student, I have a lot of expenses and my parents are not able to send me money. So, I have to do part-time job to pay my living expenses such as rent, groceries and transportation. But without part-time job it is very difficult to survive in this country. This financial stability can reduce some of the stress. Secondly, it can provide opportunity to improve the language skills and cultural understanding by interacting with the locals. Additionally, it is a good opportunity to the improve skills like time-management and multi-tasking, with the help of part-time job. Balancing work and studies at the same time is very difficult but it can teach important lessons for the future careers. That is why, the students should carefully manage their time and seek a job that offers flexible working hours to accommodate the class schedule. It can also provide the students a sense of responsibility and discipline. Finally, the part-time job provides experience, financial independence, and skill development, but it should not delay the academic progress.
