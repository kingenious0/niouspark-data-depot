"In current era, the topic of smoking in public areas has become a subject of big debate specially in crowded areas like restaurants I am also believed it should be banned in at least places like restaurants.

Foremost, a smoke-free dining environment promotes the health and well-being of both customers and restaurant staff just because of the the passive smoking. Secondly smoke contains harmful chemicals that can lead to severe health issues, including respiratory diseases and cardiovascular problems. By implementing a comprehensive smoking ban, we not only safeguard the health of non-smokers but also encourage smokers to quit at least for some time.

Some people might say that not allowing smoking takes away their personal freedom. But we have to think about the fact that places like restaurants are used by many different people who like different things and have different needs. The health and comfort of everyone in the community are more important than one person's habits.

To sum up, stopping smoking in all restaurants in the country is really important because it helps keep everyone safe and healthy which further help to build the nation
