To explicate, there are several expenses that students have to incur during their college life. It includes housing rent, groceries, bus fares, tuition fees, etc. At this moment, students can't rely only on their parents, they have to pay all these expenses on their own. Without having a part-time along with regular studies, it is not possible for them to pay these expenses. Moreover, learners need a part-time job in order to have a better quality of life.
