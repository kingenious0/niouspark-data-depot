"In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants across the country. This step is important for public health and to provide a more enjoyable dining environment.

The First and foremost, smoking is widely known to harm health. Smoke not only affects smokers but also harms non-smokers, causing problems such as breathing problems and heart diseases. If we stop smoking in restaurants, it will help keep customers and restaurant staff healthier.

Moreover, restaurants are places where people gather to relax and have a good time. Smoke can make this experience uncomfortable for people who don't smoke, making it harder for them to enjoy their food. If smoking is not allowed in restaurants, it will create a better environment for everyone, and more people can go out to eat without worrying about their health.

Additionally, the ban is in line with global efforts to promote healthy living. Many other countries have already taken this step, showing that they understand how smoking affects people's health. If we make a rule against smoking in restaurants across the country, it will show that we care about the health of our citizens and are working to reduce smoking overall.

In conclusion, I believe that banning smoking in restaurants is a good idea. This will help take care of everyone's health and comfort, ensuring that dining out is pleasant. It will also contribute to making people healthier in the long run.
