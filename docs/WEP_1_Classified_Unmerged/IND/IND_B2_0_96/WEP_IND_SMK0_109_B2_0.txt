I agree with this statement that smoking should be banned completely banned at all the restaurants in the country as their are many bad impacts of smoking on once body which is fatal for them. Firstly, it effects mental power which effects clogs and clutters their  creativity and cognitive skills which can ruin one's career at the same time making person mentally depressed if he/she doesn't smoke if addicted. Not only this it also impacts badly to health making their body weak and injurious with diseases such as making person depressed, lungs diseases, cancer, respiratory system etc. which can take one's life. Secondly, people who do not smoke can be a proof to this situation that they are healthy and doing well as a smoker becomes lazy that is can't even work properly such ruining their career as in many countries smoking is banned and if they smoke they are fined heavy penalties which may result in losing their jobs and hence without any job, they can't earn and they abuse their families and close ones for money which can lead to committing serious crimes such as theft, killing etc. which are not pardonable.
