As per demand of question it seems genuine to impose a complete ban on smoking in all the restaurants because in the restaurants every kind of person like to get food and it is the responsibility of owners of those restaurants to make people feel comfortable while they are in the restaurant. Not everyone like to smoke even children like to come with their parents in the restaurants and smoke could make some troubles  for those children. Moreover, non smokers have more problems instead of those who inhale smoke while they are come in contact with cigar and other smoke products. Smokers could also spoil the ambience of the restaurant with smoke if they are allow to do smoke in these positions. So as per my understanding it should be banned totally while sitting in the restaurants. More so, I would express one thing by giving an example that I belong to a Sikh religion and in my religion people who do smoke they have some bad images in my society even people don't like to speak with those people who do smoke. ultimately, I would emphasise on my viewpoints that smoking should be banned in the restaurants and public places.
