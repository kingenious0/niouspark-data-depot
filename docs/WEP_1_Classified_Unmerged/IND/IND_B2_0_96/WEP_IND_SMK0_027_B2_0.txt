"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Such a ban would have scores of benefits for both customers and the overall health of society.
Firstly, banning smoking in restaurants would create a healthier environment for everyone. Secondhand smoke poses significant health risks, and by eliminating smoking in these spaces, we can protect non-smoking individuals from exposure to harmful toxins. This is especially important for families with children, who should be able to enjoy a meal without the dangers of passive smoking.
Furthermore, a complete ban on smoking in restaurants would encourage smokers to reduce or quit their habit. When smoking is prohibited in public spaces, individuals might find it easier to give up smoking altogether, leading to improved personal health and well-being. This can also have a positive ripple effect on public health costs as fewer smoking-related illnesses emerge.

In addition, a smoke-free restaurant experience would attract more customers. Most people, especially non-smokers, are deterred by the presence of smoking in dining areas. By establishing a smoke-free policy, restaurants can cater to a wider customer base and enhance their reputation as health-conscious establishments.

While some argue for individual freedom and choice, the harmful effects of smoking on public health and the rights of non-smokers should take precedence. Overall, implementing a nationwide ban on smoking in restaurants is a logical step towards creating a healthier, more inclusive society. It's a decision that promotes the well-being of individuals, families, and the community as a whole."
