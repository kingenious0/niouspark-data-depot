Yes I agree with the statement that "It is important for college students to have a part-time job." because it is crucial to enhance skills by working as an employee while studying as it gives a real experience of work culture. in this phase they can make mistakes while learning and their are many seniors or mentors to teach them they will learn many basic skills also for example: Time management, speaking or writing skills, communications skills, targtes etc other most important thing is financial independence as a student must take their own responsibility of their basic needs must try to make money for their regular expenses this will help them to learn and maintain their financial condition for lifetime. Working as a part time in their student life opens to various opportunities for their career they can choose the right path for future. it also help them to build a good relations with the persons or they make a very good network with the seniors or employers . working earlier also boost their confidence and keep them motivated in their career paths
