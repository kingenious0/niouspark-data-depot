Smoking is a harmful habit that affects not only smokers but also non-smokers and the environment. I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country because it can protect the health of customers and workers, improve the quality of food and service, and reduce the environmental impact of cigarette waste. It should be banned at all restaurants is that it can protect the health of customers and workers who are exposed to secondhand smoke. Another supporting point for my inclination is that it can improve the quality of food and service that customers receive.  Moreover,  it can reduce the environmental impact of cigarette waste that pollutes the land and water. Because Cigarette waste is the most common type of litter in the world. It consists of cigarette butts, filters, packaging, and ashes. Cigarette waste contains toxic chemicals that can leach into the soil and water, harming plants, animals, and humans. Cigarette waste also takes a long time to decompose, contributing to the accumulation of garbage and greenhouse gases. Smoking can impair the sense of taste and smell of both smokers and non-smokers. Smokers tend to have a reduced ability to detect flavors and aromas due to the damage caused by nicotine and tar to their taste buds and olfactory receptors. Non-smokers can also have a diminished enjoyment of food due to the unpleasant odor and residue of cigarette smoke in the air and on the dishes.
