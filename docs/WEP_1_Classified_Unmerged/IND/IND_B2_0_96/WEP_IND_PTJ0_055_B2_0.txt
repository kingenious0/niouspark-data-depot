Different pupils have different views on this topic as far as I am concerned I agree with this notion as today it is hard to get job easily so learners who are doing any part time job not only manage to maintain there studies but also they try to help  there family by offering them a helping hand with the money they earn. Not only but also they get acquainted with the needs of themselves that what they should do with the money they earn or how to use it in a meaningful manner. This may also help them in their future thus they already know the fundamentals of the jobs or how to be loyal towards their jobs. many learners do part time jobs in restaurants, hotels as waiters,servers there they meet a lot new people and they also increase their communication skills.so it is much better for beginners to learn these skills in their college life so that they can have a bright future as they learn how to deal with different circumstances of life and how to deal with them and they also manage to afford their own expenses. So it can be concluded that college students doing part time job got helped by those jobs in many different terms such as they talk to many new individuals in their daily life in their jobs.and they can also afford their college fees without any parental funds.
