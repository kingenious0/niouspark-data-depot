"It's a big matter to debate whether smoking ought to be prohibited in all restaurants. Some respond ""yes,"" arguing that prohibiting smoking might improve public health. A restriction on smoking might safeguard non-smokers because indirect smoke from cigarettes can harm them as well. Smokers may be able to reduce their smoking or stop altogether, which is good for their health.

There is, however, another side. Some people believe that prohibiting smoking eliminates freedom of choice. When they eat out, they might want to smoke. Some people are concerned that restaurants' sales may suffer if smoking is prohibited since some customers may choose to eat elsewhere.

Attempt to solve this like a challenging problem. On the one hand, prohibiting smoking in all businesses might promote public health and enhance patron enjoyment. On the other hand, we must consider the right of individuals to make their own choices, such as whether to smoke. Others fear that prohibiting smoking could harm the businesses that own restaurants if we do so.

It's like solving a problem when you decide what the right thing to do is. People's health, preferences, and what is just for everyone must all be taken into consideration. Making everyone pleased while keeping everything in balance makes this decision difficult. Therefore, it's critical to consider many viewpoints and comprehend how each component of the puzzle fits together before making a decision."
