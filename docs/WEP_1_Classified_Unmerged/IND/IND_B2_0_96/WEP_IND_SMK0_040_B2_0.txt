"Some people contend that people should be free to make their own decisions, including whether or not to smoke. It could be argued that prohibiting smoking in public places violates people's constitutional rights.
Economic impact: If smoking is outlawed entirely, businesses that depend on smokers as patrons may suffer. This can put these businesses in a precarious financial situation.
Designated smoking areas: Some people favor designating specific places within restaurants as designated smoking areas rather than a total ban. Both smokers and nonsmokers could agree to this arrangement.
Individual responsibility: Opponents of a total prohibition may assert that it is the duty of each person to make an informed decision regarding their health. Instead of explicit restrictions, they can prefer informational campaigns and educational initiatives.
In the end, the choice of whether to entirely outlaw smoking in restaurants comes down to striking a balance between public health issues, individual liberties, and economic factors. It's about finding a balance between health, personal freedom, and businesses' needs. Different places might choose different ways to handle this situation, depending on what they think is best for their people.
