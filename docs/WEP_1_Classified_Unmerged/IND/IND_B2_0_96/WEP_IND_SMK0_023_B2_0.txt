Yes, I agree with that smoking should be banned in the all the restaurants in the country. Because it is injurious for health and make person mentally disabled. It does not only health issues for those who taking it but also bad for those who get its odour. Apart from this, for several reasons, smoking should be banned in restaurants. First, people who pay to experience fine food may be turned off by smoking in restaurants because they are public spaces. Second, exposure to smoke by nonsmokers might result in cancer and even asthma disorders. Third, children and newborns are exposed to smoking because families with children's frequent eateries. Fourth, there won't be any fresh air within the establishment, which will become smoke-filled. Fifth, smoking increases the chance of heart disease, lung cancer, and respiratory issues in non-smokers, which is harmful. Moreover, the addiction of smoking is very bad because once people addict to take to, they will never be able to leave this addiction and can ruin their whole life. So, these are the reasons verify that it should be banned. Moreover, lots of peopel enjoy their outings in restaurants and for welcoming them the environment of restaurant should be fresh and disesase free. It looks very bad if they come for eatings in smoking areas and then lead to go hospital admissions.So, this is also the biggest resaon to ban smoking in restaurants. Cause of smokers in restaurants do not let the nonsmokers to suffer from breathe disease and create trouble for them to face obstacles to take breathe in the area where they come to enjoy. Apart from them, the improper garbage of cigarette can  cause fire burnings and harms for restaurants and the neighborhood areas.
