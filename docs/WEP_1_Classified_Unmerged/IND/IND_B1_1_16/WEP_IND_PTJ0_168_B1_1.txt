As per my opinion I think that A student Who is studying is not mandatory to have A part time job unless, his/her family is facing any financial problems. But if a student want to do any part time job, He not able to find time for him self and for his studies also. In other case let us think that A particular student family is facing any financial problem and he want to help his family out of this and he want to be a helping hand for his father. These type of can do part time job and they can support their faimly, but also he should look at his academic . But student has lot of to do at college like to prepare for his exams and complete his works up to time. More in engineering study students have lot of work like assignments, observations, records, seminars,  projects and other works. This is very tough time and students don’t get time to do these, so how will they get time for job is difficult. But if the family has problem of money and they need money it is touh for them and A student must do job and do all the work
