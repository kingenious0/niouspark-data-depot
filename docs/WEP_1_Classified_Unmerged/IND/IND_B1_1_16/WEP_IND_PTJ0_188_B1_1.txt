YES, students must have part time job and they need to study too there are some advantages and disadvantages too the advantage is that by part  that he can use for his daily costs and he can also reduce the parents money for the small daily life costs and by doing this the students will slowly get to know the how things will go on in the buisness and how the jobs are there in currently and they will learn from their mistakes and they will correct their mistakes and correct them and they now a days the genration is very fast in this advanced word we need to keep upadted and the things are changing the world is growing faster and faster. there are also some disadvantages by doing the partime job the student maybi get tired very early and maybi he cannot stdy properly if the work pressure is very high so he must be very much aware of that he should focus on studies and as well as in the work too he must also get good grades to satisfy the parents at home so im not saying it is compulsary to do but yeah those whose family is in n below middle class they need to help their parents by doing job and getting some little bit of money to hopme to make heir parents happy and if the students get tired they may need to take rest and resume afterwards but yeah in ths todays days the part time job is a key for students to get money and the students must learn also because their future is totally dependant upon their studies and they must be a job but always the studies are important to the students
