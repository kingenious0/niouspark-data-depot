Now a days part time job has become more usual for unemployed youth and students .Mainly students who go for studying abroad are indluged in it to meet their day to day expenses.Most people who does part time job has to really work hard during work hours and they get paid with very low wages.There are many smart ways to earn income the thing is you should master in that course.For ex. If you had become master in knowing the market trends on increment/decrement of gold prices or even crypto or trades.Then you would   be making 25% of profit if you had invested on gold 2 months ago from now.If this wont workout you can learn editing game videos .Many influencer's and also gamers want editors for their youtube content they post in  their videos. If you are an expert you will definitely get thstkind of jobs. I don’t say that doing part time job is wrong thing.But you should limit it until you get a specified amount of money.Once you get that money you should start investing or creating a small business on your own.why I say this is because part time jobs don’t pay much .Those who does with passion is differentcriteria from this and those who does it for money is different thing.AS a conlucion doing part time job may meet their day to day expenses but wont meet future goals.
