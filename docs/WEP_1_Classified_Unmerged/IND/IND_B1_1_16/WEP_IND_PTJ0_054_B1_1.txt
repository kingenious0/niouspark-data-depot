"Yes,I agree that it is important for college students to have a part time job .As it is important for individuals that are independent and wants to help their family financially.It helps in increasing general knowledge and helps the students to manage his self/her self .Basically, it improves in self management.Part time job has become essential part of student's life as they are studying own their own and have to help their families side by side. I will be very happy if I can get a part time job as with it I can help my family and support them  like a working person .If I can't help my family at least I can pay my fees without any burden on them.I would recommend the college students to get a part time job with their skills and could manage their own expenses.Students will get the opportunity to show their skills and learn more about their skill and with experience they can learn about time management.
In the end ,I conclude that for middle class families and poor class families, their students should must do the part time job as it will be helpful for them financially. So students should learn new things besides their study so that they will get help in getting jobs.so by this their family will be proud of them and will help them in every situation as well as decision."
