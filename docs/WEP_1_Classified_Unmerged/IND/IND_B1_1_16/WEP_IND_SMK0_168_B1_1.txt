I strongly agree that smoking should be banned. A person smoking in a restaurant will be causing problem to others. Others also will get problems because of A person smoking. A person smoking may spoil the family, they have problem because of A person in the family smoking. A person might start smoking by looking at others in the family or by seeing A person who is smoking or by seeing A person like a film star smoking or A person like A person most liked sports person or many reasons to start smoking. If smoking is allowed in restaurants many will get affected. Some may not like this but their health will be spoil because of the other person smoking. A person smoking in A restaurant may make children and youth like to try this habit. They may start to try by looking at A person who smoke in restaurant. This kind of things happen because it is easy to get into bad habits. It look good for them at start but A person will understand about it later. It will be late when they understand about the bad things of health with smoking but it is difficult for them to stop at that time. It becomes difficult for them so, if A person is not allowed to smoke we can stop all these bad effects.
