In many public places already smoking is banned. In previous days we used to see many people who smoked in buses and trains. This has reduced a lot now. But in restuarants it is somewhat allowed. In my opinion I think that it should be banned in restaurants. restaurants are the places which are visited by many people. people of all ages go to restauratnts. and during any celebrations people go. family birthdays and other functions also people go to restaurants. so, all age groups of people will be there and if small kids and children see someone smoking and if this habit is not there in family, they show curious, they will ask about it, and they will want to try it sometimes. all these can be stopped if it is not allowed in public places like a restarant. Those who go to a restaurant to happily enjoy will be having trouble because of the people who smoke their. at that moment of time they may have problem of health or later they may have trouble with lungs as it will also affect the people who are not smoking but who are present near the person smoking. so, smoking in restaurants if banned will have all good effects and the health of the people will not be effected. so, i strongly agree that smoking should be bnnned in restaurnts.
