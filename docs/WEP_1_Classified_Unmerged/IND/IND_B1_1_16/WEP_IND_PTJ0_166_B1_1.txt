"It is important for college student to have a part time job." I Disagree with this statement . Because, some students who will do part time jobs in their daily life time . They will get monthly salary's . Some students who will get money they will use in good ways or bad way. From this part time jobs stundents will distract from their studies . They will not focous on their studies. Some what I agree whit statement .because some students do more hard work in their daily life and some uses with money . Now a days most of them. students are doing this part time jobs . At the same time they have to focus on their studies in college time. some students doing part time jobs with very hard work . Because with their personal problems they want need money in their life. The disadvantegs of part time jobs, they wont sleep at time, they will not focus on their classes and exams some students will do this jobs to pay their hostel fee and some personal things . the jobs will make them tired and they will not be studying good for good future jobs because marks will be less with less focus. It may make them lose time and health also.
