yes i agree with this students should do  part time job  because students have  so much of time  instead of wasting of time we should work and earn money  bascially students will suffer with writting works i will basically instruct them teachers avoid the home work instead of giving home work i suugest to give the learning something new in their very weak areas and then they can do their lesiure time as a part time work  in their available areas because no a days so many part time sobs available in online/remote  i will suggest  instead of scrolling the reels and videos available in youtube  i will suggest do part time job in their vacant time  i will suggest to do freelancer instead of wasting your time i will suggest one of the freelancer work bascially i working from 1 year onwards  i am earning the amount of 400-500(approx) in a week  it will use the daily expentidure  purposes  now i will suggest the  remote jobs as catering work  in their free time then  they can earn money
