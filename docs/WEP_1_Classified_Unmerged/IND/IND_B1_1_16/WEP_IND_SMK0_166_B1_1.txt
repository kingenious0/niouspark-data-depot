I agree with this statement. We all know the bad affects of smoking, still it is being shown in every movie and many leading actors promote for advertisements. This sends a wrong signal to the people and especiaaly students who have a liking for movie stars will try to follow and get into this habit of smoking. It is not good for helth and for society. In restaurants if people smoke they will also harm the other people. this toxic gases released will harm the person who is smoking and also the others around. it further pollutes the air and makes toxic to everyone. seeing all the harms that are they causing to the society it is not at all supportive to permit smoking in restaurants. Further, the family will be worst hit with this habit. it may appear stylish but the impact on health is a major thing that should be thought.Â  The public places like restaurants will not be safe for children and others who visit it if smoking is allowed. Kids and children will be troubled with this habit. i request that governments must take action strictly to ban it and fine to be put on those who doesn't follow the rules. the officers must strictly see that it is not done without taking any money from them so that this habit can be put to an end.
