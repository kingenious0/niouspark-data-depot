Yes,I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country.Smoking is injurious to health and is one of the reason of deaths.Smoking damages our all body parts.In restaurants,smoking should be completely banned as their are all type of persons. Some people like old age persons can have problem in breathing and small children can have bad effect on them. Children grow by seeing their elders so elders should be aware in front of children and stop smoking. It is a reason of wasting money,time .most of  the diseases are occurred due to smoking and it spread infection to all. If elders will not understand this then there will be a big problem as children will start smoking considering it a good thing. I would request all the elders to please stop this considering their health and future of a children.children learn from their families .the type of condition is at home children will get affected by them. Smoking can cause cancer which is most dangerous disease. We should make children aware about good or bad things.
