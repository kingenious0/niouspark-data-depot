I strongly agree with the fact that smoking should be completely ban at all restaurants across the country. Firstly smoking is so bad for health lungs will be damaged. and will be diagnosis with lung cancer . which is so painful . it is dangerous it may even lead to death . Restaurants are visited by many kind of peoples  ex : old people, children , ill people, suffering from lung diseases which may harm their health . If it is an old aged person it may even cause death.  And the surroundings may pollute and it  may even harm to the people whoever near to the smoking person . it may even contaminate the food which we eat . if it is that necessary a separate smoking area should be provided in each and every restaurant where it is required . And the smoking area should be at a distance from the dining area in the restaurant . it is very harmful. smoking may damage our lungs and it may lead to death .thus in my opinion smoking should be banned throughout the country which will help to maintain a healthy environment in the restaurant  where people can enjoy their meal.
