I agree with the statement that Smoking should be banned in the restaurants .The Restaurants is a place where the family or friends come together to celebrate or have just go there for change of taste. it is also a place where we eat ;it is basic manner to keep the place where we eat neat before and after ,so how can we pollute it with cigarettes ,which are made up of chemicals it is not only harmful for the person who is smoking but also for the people around him. smoking is during meal not only causes disturbance to you but also to all of them who have come with you, so smoking should be banned in the restaurants .smoking in restaurants should be banned not only because it is harmful but also it kills the people moods and appetite to eat and enjoy their time .  therefore smoking should be banned in the restaurants for safety of other people and helping the person to get rid of there habit.
