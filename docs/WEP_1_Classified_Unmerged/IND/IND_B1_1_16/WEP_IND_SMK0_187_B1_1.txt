I think smoking should not be allowed in restaurants. It is not good for health. People smoke and other people have to smell the smoke. This is not fair. Some people have asthma or other problems, and smoke can make them feel bad. Also, children and old people can get sick from the smoke. Restaurants should be clean and fresh. People go to eat and enjoy with family and friends. But smoke makes the place smell bad. It can make food taste not nice. Some people feel uncomfortable when others smoke near them. If people want to smoke, they can go outside. Not inside the restaurant. It is better for everyone. Also, when people cannot smoke in many places, maybe they stop smoking. This is good for them and for all people. In some countries, smoking is not allowed in public places like restaurants and buses. This is a good rule. It helps people stay healthy. I think no smoking in restaurants is a good idea. Everyone can enjoy food and talk without problems. Clean air is important. Smoke is not good for health or for the environment. So, I agree with the rule. No smoking in restaurants is better for all people.
