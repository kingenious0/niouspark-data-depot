Agree. As mention on the all the packets of cigarettes that  'tambaku can cause cancer'. Smoking can become the primary reason to cause lung cancer. Restaurants are public places, so smoking in public areas is unpleasant to others and it's harmful to children and senior citizens. smoking in restaurants can spread the wrong message towards young children that ' it's cool to be smoke in public'. Smoking during the mealtime reduces the appetite of the person. If a person come with family in a restaurant for a meal then smoking affects the quality family time of family. Smoking can cause the fire in the restaurants. restaurants don't need different area to allow smoking and so, more area can be used as common restaurant area, which can generate better revenue for restaurants. Because the rule will apply for whole country so customer will not get disappointed by seeing the 'No smoke' sign in restaurants. and restaurants will not lose the business because of 'No Smoke' sign board. The overall positive impact will happen on smoking culture, which leads to better health of overall country. because of above all reason I agree the statement "Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
