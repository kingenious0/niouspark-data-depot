Agree. The collage student are above 18 year and at that time their perents are also at the age of retirement. So, In 30-40 % cases there is a chance that if they don't get job after collage then they will face the financil crisis. So, if collage student is doing part time job then it will improve the work experinence which will help them to get high paid job after collage. also, for personal expenses collage students are dependent on their perents, so by taking part time job they can mannage the collage expenses at certain extent. also this money can help them try new ideas build something of their own. Mejority of collage students don't do the anything extra productive work rather than collage work and they just watch the series and waste their time. Student get more matured by hard work and real life experiences. A job can help them to meet new people make connections outside the collage. They will be more respectfull towards socity and perents for their hard work. student will get confidant about themself and about what they want to do in life.  so because of the above all reasons I Agree that collage students should do the part time job.
