"I strongly agree with the statement. As we can see the maximum population in the world consists of age group(18-30). We can see there are more of youngsters and college going students than kids and elderly people. Coming to the statement, the reason for having a part-time job for college students can be divided into two point of views according to me. One could be how needed it is for the below poverty line of people rather than sitting and other brutal jobs. other how it may be useful and work can be valued to the better earning people. Coming to the first point, we can see not all the people in the world are able to feed themselves daily. Many are working hard to earn and feed their families. So, teenage or college going people can contribute to it by doing different types of part-time job, which can be flexible and efficient but those kind of jobs that should not affect their academics. They can balance both by earning and helping the family with the needs and at the same, they can continue with their studies which helps in understanding the values of work as well as education.

The second point of view explains how a student/person from a normal earning family can appreciate or value a part-time job. First it creates a sense of responsibility among them which they can understand the importance of work in their life. Other point is, few people at this age gap have a insecurity of being dependent on parents for financial issues. This may create negative thoughts in their mind as being dependent in a liking to everyone. So I conclude this by saying, part-time needn't necessarily be a embarrassing thing, but can be considered something which can be valued and enjoying."
