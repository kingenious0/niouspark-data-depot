I feel it is actually important for college students to have a part time job.In India it is not that common or college going students to have a part time job but in the Western culture it is quite common. It the the age where many students get to know their responsibility and their parents start retiring. In such a case it is much advisable to take a part time job. This is the age where students actually  start feeling awkward to go and lend money from their parents each and every time they need it. Based on the College fees in this generation it very difficult for many families to pay for their children so that they can study i a nice college. in such a case student can take a student loan and pay it simultaneously. And having their own money makes them more responsible and makes them value each and every penny. It is an important quality to know the value of money and knowing it in young age is pretty good. It also gives them a exposure to the outside world and people. So I strongly suggest it is important for college students to do part time job simultaneously.
