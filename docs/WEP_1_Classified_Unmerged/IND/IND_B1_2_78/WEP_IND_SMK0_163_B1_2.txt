There’s something comforting about eating out whether it’s smell of freshly cooked food, the buzz of conversation, or just a moment to relax. But all of that fades the second someone lights a cigarette nearby. The smell overpowers the aroma of the food, your head starts to hurt, and your comfort disappears. It’s frustrating how one person’s habit can ruin an experience for everyone else.   Smoking in public spaces, especially restaurants, affects everyone around. The smoke of cigarette is proven to be dangerous, causing breathing issues, headaches, and even long term health problem. Why should innocent people suffer just because someone else choose to smoke?  Restaurants are meant for enjoyment, food, and connection not coughing fits or eye irritation. Even the restaurant staff, who work long shifts, are forced to inhale smoke if it’s allowed indoors. Some argue that smokers have rights, and they do. But those rights should end  where someone else’s health begins. Smokers can step outside. Non smokers can’t escape the air inside.Banning smoking in restaurants isn’t about taking away freedom. It’s about creating safe, clean, and welcoming spaces for everyone especially families, children, and those with health conditions
