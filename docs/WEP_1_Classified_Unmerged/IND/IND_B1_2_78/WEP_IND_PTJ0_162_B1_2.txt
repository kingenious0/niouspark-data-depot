"My name is XXX  and I am a student in college. I believe it is essential that a student working in college maintains a part - time job. There are numerous advantages of working while studying in college. To begin with , working part time makes us earn our own money. We don' t need to ask parents every time for our requirements . We can spend that money on books, paying fees or even going out with friends. It provides us with a sense of independence which is very crucial at this age. Secondly, if students work part time , they learn time management. They have to go to classes, complete homework and work as well . Therefore, they learn how to manage time and schedule things accordingly . This skill is not only helpful in college life but in professional life also. Also, part time job provides experience of real life. We interact with new people, learn to communicate and behave professionally . This experience helps us in gaining confidence and communication skills. Sometimes the job can also be related to the subject we are studying, which makes us more skilled and ready for future. But at the same time, there are some drawbacks. If a student work excessively , it can impact on their studies. They can be tired or stressed and cannot concentrate during classes . So it's necessary to maintain a balance between job and study. In my opinion, a part-time job is good for college students if they handle it properly. It 
helps us  in many ways and  prepares us for future life. I personally think working during 
college life is a great idea, and every student should give  it  a try at least once."
