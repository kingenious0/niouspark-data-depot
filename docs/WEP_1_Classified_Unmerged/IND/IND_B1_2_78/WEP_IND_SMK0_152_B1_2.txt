Smoking is injurious to health " is just became a phrase to advertise on products and just as a disclaimer  and only become a prime focus of tobacco company uses it as their branding and market themselves . This is so ridiculous to see great hypocrisy in the world where government generate a revenue with the smoking brands and  alcoholic company . Due to this people consume lots of injurious and hazardous substances which causes them to suffer cancer and destroys their precious life . Irony of government is that both the smoking and cancer hospitals  are managed by the government and collect taxes on medicine and even on cigarettes . Smoking should not only be banned in restaurants  but also every market place. Smoking creates an addiction among consumer and becomes their  emotional support in the hard times , as a broader sense this not good for humanity . This will create a havoc in the human society and humans no longer can sustain . Smoking also creates a negative impacts on the people , individually someone smokes doesn't suffer , but also the people around him also suffers  which also damages their health . This can be controlled initially and many awareness program should be conducted to aware the addicted people   and convince them about the harmful impact of smoking and how it destroys their family and relations .
