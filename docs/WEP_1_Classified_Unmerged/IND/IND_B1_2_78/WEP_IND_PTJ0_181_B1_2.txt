I don't think it is important for college students to have a part time job because first of all the students should must focus on study rather than working any where part time. If the student is want to and he/she should must do the part time job and it's something they should must do then he or she has no option left and they should must do the part time job but according to me the student should not be doing any part time job because the student should entirely focus on his study so that full time job he is ready and there are no problems from the place he is working in. If any student does any part time job he cannot fully focus on his studies and might back in his studies and it might show the effects in his results and if any student is working on any part time job he will not get time to focus on his study for his college. if a student is doing any part time job then he should manage his time with the work he is doing, he should do his studies and his job at a time and don't in anything and do both the things in difficult.
