"I strongly agree with statement as smoking should be completely banned from restaurants or any public eating area. Smoking is something which can cause harm for a person, for the one who is smoking and for the one is breathing the same air. It effects internal body of a person which lead to many diseases, skin problems and ultimately death. Restaurants are a public areas, where different kind of people come to have their food. It is a area which is needed to be hygienic and healthy. Allowance of smoking in these areas can be uncomfortable for people and also dangerous to kids or sensitive heath persons. If not properly precautioned their can be heavy loss to surroundings and many. There are many public displays stating smoking is injurious to health which needs to be followed. Also, it a bad habit which is started due to anxiety and stress among people. A person's mind cannot be controlled but we should be able to at least stop making smoking legal in public areas like restaurants, parks etc. Compared to other places mainly restaurants, because that is a place that should be healthy and hygienic. I conclude this by requesting every heath care inspector and to every person who own restaurants to ban smoking and make a healthy environment around public.
