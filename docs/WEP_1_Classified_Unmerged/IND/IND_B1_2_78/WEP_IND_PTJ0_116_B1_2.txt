This statement is ambiguous, and the truth of it varies from person to person depending on their circumstances. The culture, economic situation of their family and the students own list of priorities is what affects the answer for this statement.  While I am mostly in agreement with this statement and I believe that the same will be true for majority of college students in different countries, the need for it will differ. For example, in countries like the US and England where the college going students are expected to mostly support themselves with the help of student loans, part time jobs become a necessity for students. Whereas in countries like India where the family of the students usually supports them through college, it is not exactly a necessity but is considered a good way to learn independence and responsibility and is encouraged. At the same time, a part time job is secondary priority to doing well in  college studies. While this is also subject to the economic condition of the family, a student from a rich background might have not even considered getting a part time job if they do not feel a need , while  for those of the middle class and lower economic class will want to have a part time job, either for earning their own independence and freedom or to reduce the burden own their families and contribute. It is also interesting to note that while the importance of  part time jobs irrelevant to the students' carrier path is dependent on the students' circumstances, internships, even unpaid, that help the students build their resume and learn how to work  are almost  universally  considered  to be important as they help the students prepare for their future.
