Smoking is completely harmful for everyone who is smoking and the person standing next to them. We were always told that smoking causes cancer and is very harmful despite of all these cautions given still people tend to smoke just to get relief from the stress. Smoking in private areas like home or personal cabin might be fine but smoking in an open area where public is presnt is completely offensive. Smoking in restuarants is a big NO! As it effects the people around them in which it leads to the others smoking indirectly without their acknowledgment It is a very offensice act smoking in restaurants etc. If this is taling place the management should take a stand and ask the individual tp stop smoking or may ask him to leave the premises and to complete the business in private and then come back. People should be aware that smoking effects the peron who smoke but also the people around them we don’t know which person is facing which health issue like astham etc and if smoking takes place around him it might be harmful. Hence smoking should be completely stopped by everyone and educate the society on the harmful after effects of smoking at the restaurants and public areas. Here I conclude that smoking shpuld be banned comepletely and shouldn’t be encouraged by anyone to smoke in public places and to take stand in the society not to promote smoking.
