In my point of view, part time job is not mandatory .I don't agree with the statement completely. Because as a student, he or she has a lot of study work. I he/she does part time job, time will not be sufficient for him/her. It may lead to stress. Nowadays, education and  employment are very important for leading a comfortable life. For getting a good job, education is mandatory. So we should not neglect education.  But some students are doing their academic course along with part time job. This causes a lot of stress as those students have to manage both education and part time job. This may impact their academics score. Hence part time  job may not be good at every time . The students who are  doing both academic course and part time job should work for more hours compared to other students .Hence they have to sacrifice their sleep .This may impact their health. But this may not be applicable for the students those who are economically week. For those students ,part time  job is suitable. Doing part time job depends on the student's passion toward education as well as employment.
