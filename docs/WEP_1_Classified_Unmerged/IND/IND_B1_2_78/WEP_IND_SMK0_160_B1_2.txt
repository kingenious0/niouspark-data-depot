"Imagine walking in a beautiful park, enjoying the fresh air, the sound of birds, and the sight of children 
playing. Suddenly, someone nearby  lights a cigarette. The fresh air is gone. The relaxing moment is 
ruined by smoke, smell, and discomfort. This is why many people believe that smoking should be banned 
in public places—not just in some countries, but everywhere. 
First of all, smoking doesn’t just harm the person doing it. When someone smokes in public, everyone 
around them is forced to breathe in the smoke too. This is called secondhand smoke, and it's very 
dangerous. It can cause asthma, lung problems, and even heart disease in people who don’t smoke at all. 
Children and the elderly are especially at risk. Why should innocent people suffer for someone else’s 
habit? 
Also, banning smoking in public places can protect the environment. Cigarette butts are the most littered 
item in the world. They’re thrown on streets, beaches, and parks. Not only do they look ugly, but they also 
take years to break down and are harmful to animals and plants. Clean public spaces are everyone's right, 
and smoking often ruins that. 

In conclusion, smoking in public places should be banned in more countries around the world. It protects 
people’s health, keeps the environment cleaner, and encourages better habits. A cigarette may seem small, 
but the smoke it creates has a big, negative impact. Let’s imagine a world where the air is clean, the parks 
are safe, and no one has to worry about breathing in harmful smoke while simply enjoying life outside."
