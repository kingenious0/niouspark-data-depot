"Smoking in public places has become a topic of debate in many countries. Some people believe it should be completely banned, while others think smokers have the right to smoke wherever they want. However, smoking in public spaces should be completely banned because it harms not just the smoker, but also the people around them.

When someone smokes in a public area, the smoke spreads and affects others nearby. This is called secondhand smoke. Many studies have shown that secondhand smoke is dangerous and can cause health problems like asthma, lung disease, and even cancer. Children, pregnant women, and older people are especially at risk. Banning smoking in public areas would protect everyone’s health.

In addition to health problems, smoking also pollutes the environment. Cigarette butts are often thrown on the ground, which makes streets and parks dirty. These butts are harmful to animals and take years to decompose. A ban on public smoking would help keep our surroundings clean and safe.

Some people argue that banning smoking in public takes away personal freedom. But when that freedom harms others, it becomes a social issue. Everyone has the right to breathe clean air, and that right should not be taken away by someone’s smoking habit.

In conclusion, smoking should be completely banned in public spaces. It protects public health, keeps the environment clean, and supports a healthier lifestyle for everyone. While smokers can still smoke in private places, public areas should remain smoke-free for the safety and comfort of public."
