I agree  the second statement too.We that drinking and smoking are injurious to health knowing it many people does and do the same thing everywhere and everytime.Smoking is a very bad habit that too smoking in the public places such as restaurants is a very bad habit and it should be strictly prohibited.At reataurants people visit there inorder to have their food  but,making the food unhealthy by smoking at that place is very bad.The goverment of the city must take resposibility in the production of cigrates as well as other things that makes the people sick.If the person himself avoid all the stuff of drinking as well as smoking the people aroungd him/her making them unhealthy. Banning the smoking at the people living areas such a restaurants makes the place smoke free and they can have their food without worrying about their health.Day by the cigrates consumption is going on increasing this make the people feel insecure about their health.We asthe citizens of India we have take care about our health as well as the peoples health so,the politicians must take some resbonsibility inoredr to decrease the consumption of alcohol as well as other diziness causing materials which are harmful to our health.
