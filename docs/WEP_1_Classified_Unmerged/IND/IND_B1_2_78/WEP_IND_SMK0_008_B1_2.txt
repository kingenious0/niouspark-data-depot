 Smoking must not be allowed in any country of the world due to its severe consequences on health, society, and the environment. The harmful effects of smoking are universal and transcend national boundaries, making it imperative for every nation to enforce a complete ban on smoking.

Firstly, prohibiting smoking globally would greatly reduce the burden of disease and mortality rates. Smoking is a major cause of preventable diseases, resulting in millions of deaths each year. By eliminating smoking, countries can significantly reduce the occurrence of lung cancer, heart disease, and other smoking-related illnesses. This would not only save countless lives but also alleviate the strain on healthcare systems, allowing resources to be allocated more effectively.

Secondly, a global smoking ban would contribute to a healthier and more harmonious society. Smoking not only harms the individual smoker but also affects those exposed to secondhand smoke. By eliminating smoking in public places and shared spaces, countries can create healthier environments for all citizens, ensuring that non-smokers are not subjected to the harmful effects of tobacco smoke.

Moreover, implementing a global ban on smoking would have positive environmental implications. Cigarette butts, one of the most common forms of litter, pollute land and water bodies, posing a threat to ecosystems and wildlife. By eradicating smoking, countries can significantly reduce litter and the release of toxic chemicals into the environment, promoting sustainability and protecting natural resources.
