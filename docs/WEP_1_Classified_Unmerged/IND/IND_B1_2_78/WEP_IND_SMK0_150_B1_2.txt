 Yes, I completely agree with the statement.  Because smoking is injurious to health. It not only effects the health of the people, but also affects the health of the people who do not smoke. Hence smoking should be strictly banned in all the countries. Government should bring necessary rules in order the prohibit the smoking in our country. Most of the people are addicted towards smoking, which is very dangerous. everyone should take the initiation to stop smoking. Because smoking also effects the people who do not smoke at all. Because ,the people who stand near the person who is smoking, then the smoke enter their lungs through the air. Hence smoking should be prohibited. But when smoking is prohibited, it creates a loss for the people who cultivate tobacco. But the farmers those who cultivate tobacco should have to shift for other crops. Anyhow, prohibition of smoking is necessary. Beside these, smoking also effects the environment. Finally, government should take necessary steps to prohibit smoking .Beside government should also help the farmers who cultivate tobacco by giving some money for making them to shift to another crop.
