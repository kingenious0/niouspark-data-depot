"Smoking is the act of inhaling and exhaling smoke from burning plant material, most commonly tobacco. Smoking is addictive and can cause many diseases. Smoking not only cause health problems to the smoker, but also to the people close by. Smoking especially in restaurants is a controversial topic. But I agree than smoking must be completely banned in public places mainly in restaurants. Many people complaint about their freedom of smoking in public places, but one must realise that it is hazardous to all the people. Cigarette smoke consists of harmful and carcinogenic chemicals which causes many health complications which include Cancer like lung cancer, Heart diseases, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), Arthritis, etc. When people smoke in restaurants, especially the non-smokers, are forced to inhale these toxin substances. Restaurants waiters, works are especially at high risk of inhaling these and getting affected. 
The smell of the smoke is unpleasant and even disturbs or ruins the whole environment of the restaurant especially to the non-smokers. This environment causes the other non-smokers to avoid dining in and causes loss to the restaurants as well. By banning smoking completely in the restaurants can increase the flow of the customers and also brings profits. This mainly attracts the families including children, elderly people, etc. 
In conclusion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. Banning of smoking provides healthy, hygienic environment which provide safer environment for all the people. This ensures and promotes a cleaner environment."
