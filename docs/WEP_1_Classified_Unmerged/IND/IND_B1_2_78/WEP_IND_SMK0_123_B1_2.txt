Yes, I agree with the statement smoking should be completely banned in all the restaurants in the country. Smoking is one of the worst things I ever felt. I do not admire people having smoking habits. In recent years and research, we have seen the number of deaths caused by smoking, the government spends lots of money on advertisements to eradicate smoking but it still doesn't happen. A person who smokes not only deteriorates his health but also the health of people around him. The smell feels disgusting. People go to restaurants to hang out with their loved ones or to have a good time with their family or celebrate a special occasion. But people who smoke in restaurants make it really uncomfortable for the people present in the place and a sort of discomfort can be seen in them. Yes, I do agree that some people feel that it is a symbol of luxury or show in front of everyone but they might forget that it can also spoil the health of people around them, their kids or spouse. In restaurants parents visit with their children, seeing a person smoking in front of them may make the family uncomfortable and the children can have a negative impact on them. Sometimes there are possibilities of fire accidents also taking place. Thus, strict rules should be imposed by all restaurants keeping view of customer safety and comfort in order and implement strict No-Smoking rule.
