"As we all are quite familiar with the phrase- ‘Smoking is injurious to health’. It is true.
Coming to smoking in restaurants, I believe that it should be banned due to multiple reasons. Smoking causes a foul smell that leads to the entire air surrounding to smell foul. People visit restaurants to eat tasty food and if people smoke, it affects the taste, which defeats the whole purpose of spending money to eat outside. Not only that but it also causes harm to the environment.

It not only affects the environment by decreasing the air quality levels but also causes deep harm to the smoker and the people around inhaling this air. Passive smoking is often sidelined but it is also a major concern as it effects the passive smokers- that is, people inhaling the air by causing asthma and breathing and lung problems.

Cigarettes contain tobacco and nicotine which are often addictive and can also influence passive smokers to pick up the habit. Cigarettes can easily cause heart and lung problems leading to cancer.

Therefore, banning in restaurants can help in maintaining a cleaner environment, reduce health risks and overall maintain a healthier society.  It can   also encourage smokers to quit and also avoid the impoliteness the non-smokers feel while eating outside in a restaurant."
