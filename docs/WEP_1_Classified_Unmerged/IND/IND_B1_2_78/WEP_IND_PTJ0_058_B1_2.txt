Different people have Different opinion on this topic but I am concerned about notion so I agree  that college students should do part time jobs in other country so they can run their livelihoods . They can also pay their college fees can they can't burden their parents in India.  Less dependency on parents for high students . They can meet their regularly expensive by their own . Earning at young age will make independent  . Part time job is mandatory for middle class students so they can't Be a burden on their parents for their studies or other expensives. It can make them self responsible person in their life. They will get to communicate with new people everyday which would help them in gaining new life experiences. It would even help them in future tasks as they learn new skills and also manage to learn the fundament of the jobs that what are the rules to do jobs and If in future they do any job they do not find it hard to do jobs also they can manage to afford the expenses of their own so they should do part time jobs.
