I strongly agree with the fact that smoking should be completely banned in all of the restaurants across the country. Firstly smoking is so much harmful  for your health as it may cause many lung diseases. It may even lead to death. And smoking in a public restaurant may not only harm you but also it may cause an effect to the people who are around you as they breathe in the same air which is polluted because of the harmful smoke released through the cigarettes.  Restaurants are visited by many kinds of people like children, adults , and also old aged people who might have serious health issues. There may even be people with asthma and other breathing problems. If they breathe in the bad smoke they might face serious illness situations. It might spoil their entire health. And the bad smoke may also contaminate the food which we eat . If that necessary there should be a separate smoking area in each and every restaurant  which will help to reduce public smoking where all people are present. Thus my opinion is that smoking should be completely banned throughout the country which will help the country to reduce smoking in public restaurants where people come to enjoy their meals.
