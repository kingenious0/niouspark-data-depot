Part time job play important role for middle class but in my opinion I agree with  it because nowadays many students prefer to study in university or collages for high opportunity but due to economic condition is poor they  cannot do what they want in life so part time job is best thing to do for them because it becomes income source for them due to this it cannot make burden on their parents. Moreover is that part time job have increased confidence level of young generation because it increase many skills like communication skills, business skill and due to this they get all world knowledge. One of best reason is that part time job gave experience to young generation for lifetime job because they learn news things in daily life because they interact many individuals in world which increase their knowledge and learn more skills. Part time job make student independent  and well educated in early age for instance in foreign country many of students go for higher education but while education they have to do part time job for their fees  which is good way to decrease burden on their parents and themself. Other reason it make them mature in early age which is strength point for student this is mandatory for middle class families .
