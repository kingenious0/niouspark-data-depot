"SMOKING IS INJURIOUS TO HEALTH".I agree with the statement smoking causes injurious to health. We know they are many people getting caused to cancer due to smoking. Many cases are getting admitted day by day .Every day the cancer cases are getting increased in hospitals in India wide. We see many advertisements regarding smoking causes injurious to our health. Still no people cares about that. Smoking should be banned in all restaurants in India. Smoking should be reduced in our country wide because the number of cases are getting increased everyday. Everyone must  get awareness to reduce the smoking . I say that not only in restaurants but also outside of restaurants should be reduced the usage of  cigarettes. These cigarettes are very injurious as we know but still people take those due to many reasons. Some  of the reasons are getting over stressed, pressure, workload in their companies and many more reasons are there. So whatever the reason be taking something harmful to our health is very dangerous. So I suggest to stay away from those kind off dangerous things .That is good for nature and also to living beings. This also makes harm to animals. So better to stay away from smoking.
