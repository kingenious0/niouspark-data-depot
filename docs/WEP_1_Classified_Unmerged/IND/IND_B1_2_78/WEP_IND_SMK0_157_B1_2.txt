"Smoking must be totally prohibited in all restaurants across the country for the sake of public health, better dining experiences, and fairness. Cigarette smoke has more than 7,000 chemicals, most of which are poisonous and cancer-related, heart-related, and lung-related. Secondhand smoke is highly dangerous to nonsmokers, restaurant customers and workers alike, who should have a healthy environment.. A ban would eradicate the avoidable harm.
Aside from health, smoking interrupts dining. Food aromas can be overwhelmed by smoke, reducing pleasure for customers who appreciate flavor and atmosphere. Restaurants are social establishments, and a smoke-free policy allows everyone to breathe easy—literally and metaphorically. Opponents may cry about personal freedom, but that privilege ends where it starts infringing on other people's well-being. Designated smoking areas are not enough; smoke migrates, and staff members still endure exposure.
A national ban puts everyone on an equal footing. Restaurant owners worry about losing smokers as customers, but research—such as a study in the American Journal of Public Health—indicates smoke-free legislation doesn't harm profits in the long run; it tends to bring in more customers. Health, comfort, and fairness require a complete ban. It's time to clear the air."
