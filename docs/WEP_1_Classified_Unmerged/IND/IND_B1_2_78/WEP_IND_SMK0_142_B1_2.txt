Yes I agree that smoking should be banned completely at all the restaurants in the country. As of now this is the major problem going out across the country. Here we can see the people smoking near the bus stops and near the schools / colleges and near any markets ,so this can create a disturbance for the people around them. Smoking causes others to smoke just only by breathing the air. I say that government should take a appropriate action to stop selling of tobacco.  Smoking not only causes cancer but it might take peoples life sometimes. Tobacco usage must be lowered and control as soon as possible as it can create a bad impact in the present environment  , which can cause global warming and can pollute the air in many ways . As we live on the earth its our responsibility to save it from  polluting . It does not only kills the people it will make a dangerous impact on the persons organs . So as to save our living hood in the earth we should take a serious steps to control the consumption o f tobacco and continue the living cycle on the earth .
