I strongly agree with this statement because firstly smoking is danger and also the youth are getting attracted and affected with the habit of smoking which will only lead to downfall of our country. When people smoke in public places the others people get bad habit by it due to smoking, even the place becomes bad and gets polluted because of it. Habits like smoking are passed to others by involving them in style and due to wrong friends these smoking habits will affect families mostly. They are not just affecting them but even the people around them and the nature face the result. The point is sense is lost in our country there needs to be strict punishment to the people who smoke in public places. Even when the waste smoking is difficult to bare makes it more danger and the fact that it is allowed to sell this legal. Most of the students get into such bad habit due to the people they follow, famous film stars, sports people, super people and important people promote such cigarette brands or they smoke in public or on the screen which makes the youth follow and they into smoking and get addicted to it.
