"Yes, I think it is important to have a part-time job for a college student. Because as the student is a adult like above 18 years. The person cannot ask for money from his parents for  every small things. So keeping that in mind I'm agreeing for this statement.
                           As a example I'm going to say about my friend situation. His name is Nikhil. He is a bright student in CSE-AI&ML. Starting he used to spend a lot of money on clothing and food. He is a foodie by the way. As his expenditures went high he used to ask for money to his parents daily. As he is a single child his parents also pampered him very much. Day-by-day his expenditures goes high, He one day checked his online transactions history. It was around 8k in just 17 days he was shocked by see that he felt very bad that his parents very sending money for him but he is using that for useless thing. Then he thought to do something and earn money but as I said he was well pampered by his parents he don't even like to go out in hot summer. Then a suggestion was given by his friends that betting. A big blunder made by him. He thought it is very easy to get money without any hard work .But as he goes on betting he was addicted to that and got a huge loss. Then he was totally depressed and attempted a suicide attempt my gods grass he is still alive.
                          By seeing at him I thought if he have done any part time job he would be happy and didn't get addicted to the betting.
