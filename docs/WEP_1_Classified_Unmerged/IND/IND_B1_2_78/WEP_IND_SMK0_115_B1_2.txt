"In my opinion, smoking in restaurants must be banned across the country in order to protect publics' health and to enhance the dining atmosphere.

One of the arguments in favor of this is the issues related to health. Second hand smoking is dangerous to both smoking and non smoking persons, and when a restaurants' policy does not include any rules against smoking, then everybody is in contact with these toxins. This can result to chronic conditions like respiratory and heart diseases, and some other health complications even to those individuals who do not smoke. But, in a smoke free restaurant there are no such conditions for anyone's health. Banning smoking in restaurant also improves the overall dining experience. Cigarette smoke contains overwhelming unpleasant odor, which is disturbing in the course of eating and relishing any other type of food. But when restaurants are smoke-free, a customer may savor their meal the way it was intended to be without being disturbed by smoke. The restaurant employees, regularly working in a smoky environment, go to work with high chances of inhaling smoke which results in health hazards. Any person at work should be safe and secure from everything that is harmful. So, if smoking inside the restaurant is prohibited, the employees would not be subjected to smoke.

In conclusion, banning smoking in restaurants is very important to protect the public health, to create a better dining atmosphere and to ensure that the workers have a safe working environment."
