Smoking not only leads to health problems to the smoker but also causes for the people around them. I strongly suggest that smoking should be completely banned at restaurants in the country. First and foremost, it has been proven that Tobacco consists of carcinogenic components which causes serious health issues like lung diseases, anxiety and heart attacks, for those who inhale the smoke that is emitted from the tobacco. When a person smokes in public places like restaurants the near by people also inhale the smoke emitted from the smoker, which is not fair to impose upon other people. If required restaurants should have special places for smoking so it doesn't affect others. Allowing smoking may also lead to less business as customers are not interested to have dine smoke zone as it might spoil their appetite and feel uncomfortable, so the number of customers gradually decrease. Smoking also a high impact on environment as the amount of carbon and other toxic elements released into atmosphere is very high due to increase in number of smokers. In conclusion I suggest that smoking should be banned in restaurants as it leads to low business and I am on the side where people's health is more concern.
