In today's evolving world with many new technologies and innovations coming into the picture money and a job plays a very important role in students' life. Having a part-time income for college students would benefit them in many ways. Part-time jobs help students to gain foundational expertise and enhance their self-confidence. This benefits them in this phase of student life and also in the future goals they would like to achieve. To share my personal experience, I am a BTech Student and currently in my 4th year. I give tuition to school students and earn a good side income from this. This might not be a dedicated corporate-style part-time job or internship but it is one thing I do for side income. Through the income I get, I use it for my course fees, my travelling expenses, my clothes, food expenses and other miscellaneous things. This helps me feel independent and self-conscious about budgeting and financial management. Especially for students who go to other countries for their masters or higher studies on educational loans and are far from their families, they can't ask for money from their families, but instead a part-time job can help them handle the hard expenses in their new life. Travelling to the university, paying their hostel or dorm rent, buying their groceries and handling their internet bills, and buying stationery and electronic accessories all are a burden for the students. In such scenarios, a part-time job with at least some side income would relieve the financial burden on them. Thus, I believe that having a part-time job is important for college students.
