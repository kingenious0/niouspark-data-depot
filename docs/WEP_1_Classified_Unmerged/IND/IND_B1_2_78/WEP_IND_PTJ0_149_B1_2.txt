PART TIME JOB:  Part time job is a very underrated work in our country. Although it has many advantages of its own, majority of the people in our country are not willing to take it up. It is important for college going people to have a part time job. It helps the students in many ways. It provides them experience for their future job. It also supports them financially through out their college life.The cycle between their college, job and academics allows them to have a proper management of time and scheduled day to day life. Despite of having many advantages, we see many people aren't interested to do it so. These can be because of many factors.One of them is "what will the society think?". Students often get questioned instead of encouragement whenever they are interested in doing a part time job. Relatives, family friends etc look down on many kinds of jobs and criticizes the person for taking it up. The parents, instead of feeling proud, feels inferior if their child is working a part time as they feel that they're not providing enough for their child. We must encourage college students to take up part time jobs as they help them be independent and strong.
