Yes, in today's world, most of the students like taking a part-time job during college. Is it good to have a part-time job while attending the university, having a part-time job can offer them many benefits. First, students can earn some money by having a part-time job, so they can offset their tuition fee which is certainly helpful once they finish their degrees. Also, they are able to pay off for their stationery and for other living costs such as clothes, everyday expenses and so on.Those who favor students' employment claim that students can learn social responsibilities and management skills while work gives them practical experience, which will be something that school education could never provide. For those who oppose students' taking part-time jobs, they have their arguments that students have to concentrate on their study in order to get well-known university or college first and other reasons such as work will take too much time, which should be used in physical exercise for a healthy body and study for a bright future.A student with a part-time job will learn not only great work ethic, but also how to balance the demanding workloads between school and work. This is great for when students go on to become involved in other activities because they will know time management and how to balance their energy between activities.
