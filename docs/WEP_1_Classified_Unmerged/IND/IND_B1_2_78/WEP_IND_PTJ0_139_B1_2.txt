"Yes, I totally agree on the fact that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
Having a part-time job is very useful as a student in this economy. Many students can use the money to clear off their student loans as college is an expensive place. Having a source of income will automatically make a student’s life easier as it helps in financial assistance by clearing off debts and acts as family support.
 It also boosts their confidence as they will have to socialize and learn new skills in order to do a job. It creates a strong work ethic which creates a sense of responsibility and prepares one for the future. It also helps in building a good network with new people and develops social skills. All the new skills and experiences will in turn help in boosting the resume. 
Having money of our own will also make us responsible and we can learn about controlling our finances by limiting spending and saving for the future accordingly. It also creates a sense of time management and punctuality in students which is much needed. Students wouldn’t have to depend on others for money anymore.
 They become independent and this creates confidence and teaches a lot of important life lessons, both- in career point of view as well as in individual growth. Hence, an overall character development can happen and it acts as an important part of a student’s life.   "
