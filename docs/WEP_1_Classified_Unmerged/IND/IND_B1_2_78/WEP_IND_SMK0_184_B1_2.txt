I believe smoking should be banned in all restaurants across the country. Smoking affects not just the person who does it but also others nearby. Breathing in smoke can cause health issues like asthma, coughing, and other serious problems, especially for children and the elderly. Restaurants are places where people go to enjoy meals, relax, and spend time with loved ones. The smell of cigarettes can ruin the atmosphere and make the food less enjoyable. It also creates an unhealthy environment for both customers and staff. Non-smokers should not have to suffer just because someone chooses to smoke. If smoking is not allowed, more people will feel comfortable eating out. It also shows care and respect for everyoneâ€™s well-being. In addition, when smoking is restricted in public places, some people might reduce their smoking or try to quit. This can lead to a healthier society overall. Many countries have already stopped smoking in indoor public areas, and the results have been positive. Clean air in restaurants makes the experience better for everyone. To keep restaurants safe and pleasant, it is important to have a smoke-free space. That way, people can enjoy their food without worrying about their health or the smell of smoke.
