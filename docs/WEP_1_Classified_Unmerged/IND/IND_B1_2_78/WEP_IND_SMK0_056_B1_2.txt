No i don't agree with this i disagree with tjis .no smoking is very harmful for our health. because i don't like it and in current time we see that are many people and in specially young age students take drink to much which is not good for there and there family also because when they drunk to much so they don't have any emotion and they also harm to other people and our family people also . they waste our money. they may causes very serious condition and at this time some people have not much money to doctors for our treatment so i totally disagree with this and i also tell there parents to see our children what they have to do in free time they have to see and also tell our children don't misuse with things and talk to those people who have drink and i appreciated with those people who goes to in every place in village to tell people they control our children because many people children in middle age they goes very serious condition so don't drink .
