I do not completely agree. It depends on several factors. If a university or college is providing fee waiver for tuition fee and giving stipend which is enough for accommodation and minimum personal expenses, it is not necessary for student to have a part-time job. Moreover, sometimes having a part-time job makes the student less productive at studies by consuming time which can cause poor results. But it is also important for students to have financial support if there is no support from the institution in terms of fee waivers or stipends as it might become a financial burden on parents who have less income. Also, in some cases where parent's income is not enough to sustain the family needs, it also requires the students to have a part-time job to support the family otherwise it forces the students to stop studies and go for a full-time job. Overall, irrespective of the factors or family situation, it is not recommended for students to have part-time jobs while studying. Students need full time to focus on studies and get benefits of it without any deviations or disturbances. Part-time jobs may also cause stress, work-pressure etc. which are not good for students' growth. So, it is essential for the universities/governments to provide enough fellowships to students to meet their educational needs to prevent them from having part-time jobs
