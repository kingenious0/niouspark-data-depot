Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.yes I agrre with it as the people around will not feel comfortable .It is bad for your health but some fell it as a achivment to start smoking .stoping it is in our hads governament should take it in there hands to stop this habit from people. If the government think about it seriously than t is possible to bring this change in the society and make a healthy society. people also must understand the bad things that happen with this habit. It may look style in the first moment. But, if we still do it we will become affected badly with this as it spoils our lungs and we may get many lung problems when a person is young they will not understand this when they get old they will know. But better to stop in the first time olny rather to wait till your helath spoils. So it is not just the gvernment task but it is the tsak of the people to understand about this bad habit. In the smoking advertisemesnt also it will be shown as bad only. But many will not understan this and they try and become addicted. So, I strongly say that smoking should be banned in restaranrs.
