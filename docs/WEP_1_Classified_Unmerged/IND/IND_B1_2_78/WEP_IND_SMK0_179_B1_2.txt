"Yes I agree that smoking should be banned in all the restaurants in the country
Because as we know that smoking causes cancer and also a important thing is that smoking is very dangerous to the person who is adjacent to them the person who is smoking. Smoking is one of the worst addiction to all the persons .If the smoking is allowed in the restaurant's the persons who goes to the restaurants will be uncomfortable. If the children and pregnant ladies are nearby they will get effected very much. Our country children has no protection but we should go ahead and ban the smoking in all the restaurants . smokers should have a area where they can smoke but not in the restaurants so our government should give a strict rule that smoking is prohibited in restaurants .everyone should be aware of it. If restaurants continue the same the young teens will get influenced but seeing at them and think as a fashion and will get addicted to the smoke. I conclude that the smoking should not only banned in all the restaurants but also in all the public areas like bus stops ,hospitals, and etc..
so by concluding this I will agree completely with the statement
