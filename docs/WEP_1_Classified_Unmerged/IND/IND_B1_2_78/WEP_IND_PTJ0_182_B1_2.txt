Coming to the first statement given, I agree the statement as it is hard for every parent to get the money for monthly wise and to pay the children fee so,students should work for themselves inorder to get the money it may be difficult sometimes doing both the things at a time i.e.,studying as well as working.But,they can probably learn new things from their work as well as their earnings won't make the parents feel burden.when the students go fo working the learn new things from the society as well as they try to save the money as it is their earnings. We usually listen news from the abroad countries that the students at that place earns themselves inorder to study as well as for their livehood so they do have much courage in doing anything.But the children here fear for a little things by giving the freedom of earning the students can get good courage.Actually,studying for more time makes student feel stress as well as nervous involving in the other thing of learning new makes them feel better.The knowledge we get outside is very good and useful than that we learn from our textbooks.It just teaches the new thing as well as the struggle that is required to earn something.
