I kind of do agree but I feel not exactly a part-time job instead an internship can be more beneficial for college students. Through a side hustle like this, students can get more exposure to the work and technology through which they can improve their skills. It would not only help them in increasing their knowledge but also it would be a means to become financially independent very early in their life. This can boost the confidence and can make them take more risks ahead in future. It also makes them very disciplined alongside due to the given working hours of the part-time, deadlines etc. which thereby makes them learn about time management. Students will be able to do multitasking since they need to manage the part time as well as the college studies. It also helps in decision making skills as they have to decide the priority of what work to do first and how to do. Through college students usually get theoretical knowledge so part time would give them a good hands-on experience practically. It is one of the best ways to apply our theoretical knowledge to the real-time applications. They can also make new connections which might be helpful in future. So I do feel it has a lot more advantages than disadvantages if a student has the determination and dedication to do it.
