Moreover, working while studying enables students to become financially independent and responsible. Higher education often comes with significant expenses, and relying solely on loans or parental support may not be feasible for everyone. By earning their own income, students can contribute to their education costs, gain financial autonomy, and learn important financial management skills.
Additionally, working while studying enhances academic performance.

The responsibility of working compels them to manage their time more efficiently, leading to improved academic productivity.
