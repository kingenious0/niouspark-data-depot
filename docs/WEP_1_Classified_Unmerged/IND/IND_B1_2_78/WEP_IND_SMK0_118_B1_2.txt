I completely agree with the statement. Restaurants are the places where people go with their family or friends and stay longer by eating food to have a good time and fun. Smoking is the action which kills people who are not only smoking but just breathing the smoke by staying beside the smoking people. Smoking in those places leads non-smoking people also several health issues related to lungs and breathing and may causes deadly diseases like lung cancer which leads to death. Also smoking in restaurants damages the ambience because of the smell. If one person is smoking in a crowded area, he/she is causing problems for many other surrounding people, especially places like restaurants where the crowd stays for longer has major impact for more people including kids who will be affected faster. It is essential to ban smoking from all public places in general. Though if people are still demanding, then there should be designated smoking zones which are far enough from the public to prevent the public to inhale that smoke. But most small to medium scale restaurants don't have enough space to felicitating smoking zone maintaining enough distance from the crowd. So, banning smoking completely and making it a strict rule can save more lives.
