As a responsible citizen of Indian i absolutely agree that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. The smoking rate in our country that too especially in the case the current generation's youth is very alarming. Smoking is one of the main reasons why thousands of  people die with cancer every year. In such a case making these people stop to smoke for at least one time  in day or a in week depending on the frequency at which they go  to a restaurant is pretty good.Infact smoking is very hazardous than drinking. The life span of of chain smoker is much much lessthan that  compared to a teetotaler.  And according the current air quality present around the world, it is not at all advisable, for instance, in the case of Delhi breathing the normal air is equivalent to smoking 7 cigarettes a day. A restaurant is a place where families, friends visit and dine in happiness. It's also a place very starting from toddlers to aged people, every age group visits. In such a place smoking is not at all advisable. The cigarettes smell is hated by many people and hen thee people sit around a smoker who just then starts smoking, they get irritated and uncomfortable and thy are high chances that they may leave the restaurant one and for all  and also they might not visit again because of the impression formed, hence it' a loss for the restaurant itself. Most t of the Restaurants are air conditioned so the same air will rotate around the room, which also includes the smoked air  Also there might be people with asthma problems or lung issues therefore it is no at all recommended to smoke near them. Hence i can conclude that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country.
