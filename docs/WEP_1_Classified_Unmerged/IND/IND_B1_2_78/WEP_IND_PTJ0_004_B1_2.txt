The pursuit of a university degree demands considerable dedication, focus, and commitment. Therefore, it is my belief that students should refrain from any form of work during their graduation studies. By dedicating their full attention to their academic pursuits, students can maximize their learning potential, achieve academic excellence, and lay a solid foundation for their future careers.

Firstly, graduation studies require substantial time and effort. Engaging in part-time or full-time work can significantly impede students' ability to devote themselves fully to their coursework. It may result in divided attention, reduced study time, and compromised academic performance.

Secondly, focusing solely on graduation studies allows students to delve deeply into their chosen field of study. It provides an opportunity for comprehensive learning, research, and skill development, all of which are essential for future success. By avoiding distractions from work, students can fully immerse themselves in their studies and extract the maximum benefit from their educational experience.
