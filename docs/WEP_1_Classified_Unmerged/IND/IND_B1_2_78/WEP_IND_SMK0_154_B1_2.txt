"Smoking is one of the dangerous practices. It is very harmful and can be fatal. Therefore, smoking must be completely banned in all restaurants in our country.
Smoking can cause diseases such as lung disease, cancer, etc. If consumed for a lengthy period, it leads to the accumulation of a huge amount of smoke in the lungs, which leads to fatal diseases like cancer and lung fibrosis.  Thus, it is unbelievably bad for one's health.
Now, restaurants are one of those places where people, families spend fun time with each other, so there would be people of every age group. Hence, smoking in such places would not only affect the smoker but also a large group of people. Children will not only have to face health issues, but they will also see smoking as a normal thing. The children might get inspired to try it, particularly teenagers. The old people may also suffer due to suffocation and bad air quality. 
Moreover, it reduces the charm of a peaceful and modest environment and makes people uncomfortable. It also raises a question on the quality of food that will be served in the restaurants. This results in a backlash of restaurants and lowers the customer demands.
Therefore, we need to get serious, as this is a genuine issue that may put many lives in danger. So, serious and immediate actions must be taken, and smoking must be banned in all restaurants in the country."
