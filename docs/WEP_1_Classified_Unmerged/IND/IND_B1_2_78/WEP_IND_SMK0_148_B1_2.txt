   Yes, I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the countries in the world. Now a days selling the products like cigaretts are increases day by day. By, smoking these cigaretts can cause cancer and many other lung disease . The person who smokes continuously   can suffer from the respiratory problems. So, the life span of the human gradually decreases for the coming years.
    There are many restaurants where  the smoking is allowed.  And a person who is smoking can suffer from respiratory problems but not only him but spreading the respiratory problems or health issues like cancer  to the following children . It passes through the generation of the human . 
  Due this smoking , the toxic gases released from it can harm the children and elders to. Where the life of the children or the elder spoil . And the factories where the  smoking products like cigaretts are made and marketed into  further restaurants . where this factories releases harmful toxic gases. which disturbs the  life cycle of the environment . and disturbs the ozone layer which kills the marine life by releasing the harmful products into it.
