"Smoking should be banned in restaurants because it is harmful for health and creates discomfort for non-smokers. Restaurants should be smoke free areas so that everyone can enjoy their meals in a safe and pleasant atmosphere.
 
Secondary smoke contains a lot of harmful chemicals which cause serious health issues like cancer and heart diseases. Exposure to even a small amount of smoke is dangerous for both the customers and the staff who work for long hours there. A smoking ban would ensure a healthier lifestyle for everyone.

Countries like Canada and Ireland have implemented smoke-free policies in restaurants. They have seen positive results, leading to better air quality and decreased health risks. Such examples show us that bans can have a positive impact.

 Moreover, smoking in restaurants discourages families from visiting. Children are vulnerable to the secondhand smoke and many families avoid restaurants where smoking is allowed. Smoking free restaurants would make families feel more welcome and also benefit the business economically.

As awareness of the dangers of smoking grows, more people are beginning to prefer a smoke free place. So, a smoking ban in restaurants would align with public opinion. Such measures would protect public well-being and encourage a healthier society. "
