My personal perspective on banning smoking in all restaurants in the country is to agree, for the reasons we can analyse this  course of action in three perspectives, impact on general health, impact on Environment and impact on business. Impact on health, as everyone knows smoking is dangerous for health and causes cancer, what is less known is that smoking is not only dangerous for the person who is smoking but also to people around them.  When a person smokes out the air around him is polluted, and the people around them breathe the same air, this is called passive smoking. Passive smoking is harmful and affects the health of the individuals in the same manner as smoking over a longer period. So, while one can argue that their own health and how they care for it is their own choice, banning smoking in public areas like restaurants where children and families come to eat and enjoy is valid as it protects the non-smokers from the dangers of passive smoking. Fallowing the same logic, as smoking is banned in the restaurants, the air will have less pollutants in them, Leading to a better environment. Impact on business is two-fold, while I don't believe there will be much of a negative impact on the restaurant business as all restaurants in the country will fallow the same rule, so anyone who wants to eat in a restaurant will have to avoid smoking while in it and have no other options, but it might impact the cigarette making industry, that supports and provides the livelihood for a  lot of people negatively. As people aren't allowed to smoke in restaurants they may buy less cigarettes, decreasing the demand.
