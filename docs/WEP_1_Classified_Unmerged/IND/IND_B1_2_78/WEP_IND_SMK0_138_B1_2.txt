"Smoking in all restaurants of the country should be prohibited completely. It fairly states that smoking is harmful to public health and uncomfortable for non-smokers. It also spoils a good dining experience.
Firstly, health risks caused by smoking are well documented. Secondhand smoke proves to result in life-threatening diseases, especially in non-smokers, ranging from respiratory ailments to cardiovascular diseases. According to CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S), about 41,000 deaths among adult non-smokers are attributable to secondhand smoke exposure yearly. Restaurants would be places of leisure and fun, yet sourly ruined by smoky air that could turn even these places into health hazards, especially for children, the pregnant, and the sick.

Moreover, smoking brings forth great discomfort in many customers who would otherwise enjoy being in restaurants. Most people dine outside because they want a pleasant atmosphere. The smell from the smoke would then end up behind clothes and hair, thus ruining someone's experience. Many restaurants realize that by adopting a no-smoking establishment, they can attract more custom because of the appeal of a smoke-free environment. For instance, when New York City began implementing an extended smoking ban in restaurants in 2003, studies conducted by the city soon after indicated a rise in restaurant business because of diners who deliberately sought out those places because of less concern for their health and comfort.

Thus, it is a complete ban on smoking within the premises of a restaurant that makes it a health necessity and also a basic positive initiative toward a more relaxing atmosphere while dining. Such a ban protects and promotes health for patrons while improving the overall experience, therefore benefiting both the public and the restaurant industry in shaping a culture of health and wellbeing across the nation."
