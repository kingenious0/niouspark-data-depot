"Yes , I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
Smoking In restaurant areas not only effect the person who is smoking but also affect the people nearby. It causes respiratory problems for the people who are respiring the smoke. If this continues it also effect the sorrounding areas(air pollution). So we should ban smokng In restaurant areas.
By banning smoking in  restaurants we can improve dining experience in the restaurants. So this makes more people to visit the restaurant. As smoking is banned it gives a good and healthier environment for people. It also increases the economic benefits for the business.
Not only in restaurats but also it shoulb be banned in all living areas. So that the living organisms like humans,animals ,birds etc will not be effected. So that all maintaince costs like cleaning can be reduced.  The people who visited restaurant will enjoy the food if the smoking is banned.Smoking banned in restaurant will have great number of customers as the place is secured from hazardous gases present in a smoke.
It is important to ban smoking in restaurants. Because of this a lot of air pollution is reduced in the environment . This successfully implemented in some countries . So this should also be implemented in remaining countries to be have a good environment and nature."
