 I personally agree with part time jobs for students. As this is the time where they go out to place for studies and explore new places. Part time job teaches an individual on how to earn and save at the same time and also teaches a lesson on how important and difficult it is to earn money. A student in their college era tends to or have a feeling to earn money on their own even if they are provided from their home. Students in college time tends to go to places outisde and explore a lot and they need money for it hence part time jobs come in hand for them and helps them financially, few students cannot ask for money each and every time from their parents this can also be a reason for the need of the money for them. Keeping money apart part time jobs also teaches a lot of ethics to the students when right job is choosen by the individual and it may also impact the students to work hard. If the student is capable of balancing his academics and his part time job well the student can continue to do the part time job. Hence I conclude that part time jobs play a major role in a students life teaching them responsibilities,knowing how the outside world is struggling for money brings maturity in them and ultimately they can stand on their own feet instead of depending on others.
