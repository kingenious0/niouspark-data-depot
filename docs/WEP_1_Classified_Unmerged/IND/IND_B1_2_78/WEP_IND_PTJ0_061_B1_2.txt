"Yes I agree ,that it is important for college students to have a part time job. Because if students have any job they studied without any problem of money they are independent. Parents have no pressure for their college fees or any other budget. If students have any job they also took some knowledge about environment of the country . Students also get experience about the outside public with part time job. That how we deal with our problems about our world problems also . Students are feel independent they are not dependents on their parents. They earns their money own with their own job . Parents also feel proud on their students. Students also started earning at young age which helps them in their career. This is mandatory for middle class families. Some parents wants to educated their child but because of money problem they can't afford. If child get any job they have no problem in their study . And also help their family with their job . Students have no tension for their college fees. For instance, in abroad students also studied and also get job side by side . They own earn their money with their job . And also sent money for their parents. So it is important for students to have part time job.
