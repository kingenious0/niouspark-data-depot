"Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country." I totally agree with the above statement because as we know now days in our country smoking is a new trend which is unlocked, actually the number of people who smoke are also increased. I recently saw the survey that people of age group 15-25 are more addicted to it. Here the main reason of this hike is that people are not aware about the side effects and if they know it is obvious that they will not follow and coming to restaurants they also do the same actually they allow smoking in there place instead of not allowing they made a separate room for smoking. I gone through a case where a minor boy who was smoking in the restaurant and instead of stopping or checking his ID proof the workers/waiters there was just watching and ignoring him actually in our country there is a rule to verify the ID proof just to check a he/she is underage or not if he/she is then they are not entertained with smoking and alcohol but restaurants are not implementing these rules and regulations just because they want to make money. At last, I would like to conclude that start implementing the rules and regulations or ban smoking in the restaurants.
