I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job, As many of the students come from various backgrounds and cities, they need to take care of their own belongs, responsibilities. As an undergraduate, there are a lot of expenses for the students. For example: drafter, food fee, hostel fee, stationary, etc. The students cannot ask for more allowance because the parents have already invested a lot in them and there a guilt feeling when we ask for money for small things. Many of the students can use their skill and earn more than to take care of themselves as these days many opportunities are available for the students in the internet like typing ,coding, web development, editing, etc. The other benefit of having a part time job is money management. The student won't spend the money on lavish and useless things rather he would try to save it and use it in a meaningful way as he knows the hard work and dedication it took towards it. These days many of the students become self made entrepreneurs as they develop many high level skills. Having a part time job is also a great way to gain experience and multitask. In conclusion, A student must stand on his own roots and earn for himself for completing the basic needs required.
