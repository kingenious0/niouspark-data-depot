It is important to have a part time job for every college student Because , in India the government doesn't allow students to work while studying and i support this for their care and affection towards the youth of the India but usually in Foreign like America the students should has to earn money by themselves by studying at universities but we usually she that they are having only 2 working days in a week at college and in remaining days students usually they go for work and earn the money and their government do agree them to work at early age to run their expenses. In foreign usually their parents won't care about children that must so they need to handle their expenses by themselves but where as in India our parents take all our control( they take care about all the expenses done by ourselves and our entire family) and also I request our Indian Government r to implement new rule regarding that even a college student can do part time job to run their family and  this can make a big move by taking this words serious as if i will be till taking stand for the elder one who is earning the house. if these rules are implemented then the difference between the foreign countries and India is:- in Foreign college students will just earn money for their expenses but can't led a happy living and where in India if these rules are implemented then students can earn money for their family as support system and live a happy and joyful live with family.
