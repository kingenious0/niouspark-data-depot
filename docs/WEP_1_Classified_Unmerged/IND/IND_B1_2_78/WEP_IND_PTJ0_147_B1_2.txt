Part time jobs play an important role in the student life. So I agree with statement that its important for college students to have a part-time job. Part-time jobs really play a very major role in every college student life.  In every college student life ,there is a goal is get rich , even I do have that. Few work on it and few forget about it . Every college student life is a happy chapter of their lives. Even I feel the same for some moments. Getting into Part-time jobs do have reasons for most of the college students. Few may work for something important in their lives. And also few may work to get addicted to some bad habits which should be avoided.   In some of the cases these jobs really save us from hard things. Most of the college students work for money. But also to help their parents to get financially  strong. I feel most of the students work for the purpose of money which can be used according to their freedom. Every students stop asking money to their parents when they come to particular age .I strongly agree with part time jobs really helps to use money in our way. It varies on person to person how they spend .It depends how we work and goals towards our career.
