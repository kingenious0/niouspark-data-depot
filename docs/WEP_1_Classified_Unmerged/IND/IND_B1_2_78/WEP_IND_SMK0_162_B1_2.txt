"My name is XXX , and I firmly feel that smoking should be totally banned in all 
restaurants in the country. There are some very crucial reasons why such a ban is 
needed. 
Secondly, smoking is a serious health riskâ€”not only to smokers, but to everyone 
around them. Secondhand smoke has toxic chemicals in it that can cause dangerous 
health problems like asthma, heart disease, and even cancer in people who do not 
smoke. To inhale cigarette smoke while in a restaurant, where individuals go to eat 
andsocialize, can be highly unpleasant and unhealthy. 
Secondly, prohibiting smoking makes the environment cleaner and more pleasant for 
everyone. The odor of smoke can spoil the flavor of food and remain in the air, 
creating an unpleasant atmosphere. A smoke-free restaurant is more inviting to 
everyone, particularly children, pregnant women, and individuals with health issues. 
In addition, most nations that have prohibited smoking in public areas have 
experienced positive outcomes. Restaurants tend to draw more patrons, particularly 
families, when the atmosphere is healthy and clean. Employees also gain from a 
healthier working environment, free from the risks of passive smoking. "
