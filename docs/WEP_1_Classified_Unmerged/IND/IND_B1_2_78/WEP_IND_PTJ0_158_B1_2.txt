"A part-time job enables students to understand various aspects of an employment and gives new 
experiences and enables student to know the real world  
According to me it is important for college students to have a part-time job. A student can 
understand the real world by experiencing the kind of atmosphere at a store or business. It makes 
students equip dealing with different people who visit the store and problem solving skills. Students 
can also know about the key elements required to run a business. They can also view the business at 
core and understand the efforts that is put into a business. Part-time jobs can set an example or a 
mock training for students to understand the employee and manager relationship and the decorum 
of the workplace. Students can understand an important aspect of handling money and money 
management. They can learn how savings are important and can become financially independent. It 
also helps in learning time management. It also helps students to understand what it takes for a 
person to do multi-tasking.  Through multi-tasking, students can understand how to manage time to 
complete different works. Students can also prosper in studies with time management. It enables 
students to develop communication skills and soft skills required at a workplace. In a workplace or 
institution it is very important to understand the hierarchy. It makes students gain real time 
experiences helping them to understand the statics of a business. Time management and a good 
behaviour is important for a person to be a good employee at a workplace. Students can develop 
employability skills also. 
Overall, having a part-time job has is advantageous in a way and disadvantageous also. It completely 
depends on the studentâ€™s capability of managing tasks and time."
