I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. First of all, smoking is very harmful to our health. It causes serious diseases like cancer and heart problems. But the problem is not only for smokers. People who are near smokers also breathe the smoke. This is called passive smoking, and it is also very dangerous. In restaurants, many people come with their families, including children and old people. They should not be forced to breathe in smoke while eating. Second, the smell of smoke can make the restaurant environment very unpleasant. When someone smokes, the smell stays in the air and on clothes. This can make the food taste and smell bad for others. People go to restaurants to enjoy food and relax, not to smell smoke. Also, banning smoking in restaurants can help smokers. When they cannot smoke in public places, they may smoke less. This can help them become healthier over time. Many countries already have rules against smoking in restaurants, and it works well. It creates a clean and comfortable place for everyone. In conclusion, banning smoking in restaurants is a good idea. It helps protect peopleâ€™s health and makes restaurants better for all. Everyone deserves clean air while eating.
