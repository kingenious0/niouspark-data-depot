I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. As its harmful for the person smoking and they person around the one who is smoking. A prime example is Delhi the capital of India, It is the most Air polluted state in India, Breathing the air in Delhi is equal to smoking 4 times a day. Many types of people visit an restaurants, A few may smoke and a few may not smoke its their own choice but smoking in public places such as a restaurants is not acceptable as many people might suffer from the smell and smoke around them. Few restaurants have seen this issues as a major problem, As they cant forcefully make a smoker quit they have instead created an smoking zone which is isolated from the restaurant and is an open space where the smoke can go away with ease. But any restaurant is not a place for smoking and we shouldn't encourage such acts and put a strict ban on smoking in public places as various people are present. Quitting smoking is an option, But smoking in a public place is a crime. I urge the Government Of India to ban smoking in all restaurants or any public places.
