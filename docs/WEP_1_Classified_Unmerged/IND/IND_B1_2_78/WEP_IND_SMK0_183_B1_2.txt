Definitely, I agree that it should be banned in every restaurant in every corner of the street so that people should be better in the society. As we all know smoking is injurious to health, it must be banned as even its credentials are not good for health.  So, we can even bring a law against it, so that they could be punished. Because, once we addict to it, then it's a serious problem which can cause cancer and even sometimes lead to death. So, we need to be  very cautious about smoking. Even because when the other person smoke, the person beside him tends to attain the smell and can damage his liver also which infects him too ,so it's so dangerous to both the persons. So my kind request to ban it or to get better awareness about smoking to everyone. Making it  ban in every restaurant can help people to forget and avoid it and could get better in the society.  There must raise a rule for not smoking not only in restaurants but everywhere. Spreading awareness even helps many people to understand better about it. So, for the ones who was habituated before only can avoid it by using medicines and preferably stopping it from further damage. So, final statement comes here "Smoking is injurious  to health".
