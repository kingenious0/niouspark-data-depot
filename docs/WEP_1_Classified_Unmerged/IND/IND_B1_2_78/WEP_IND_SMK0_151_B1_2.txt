"                       In this generation , the health became wealth in one's life .The only thing which u cannot buy with money even of you are one of the richest person in the world. as the time changes people are getting more prone to get affected by many things which are hazardous to their health. People with bad practices such as doing drugs, consuming high quantity of alcohol, smoking, vaping etc not only effect their health but also ruin the health of other people living with them, which affect them physically and mentally as well. now-a-days everyone from all age groups have smart phones with them and usage of social media is also increased. As  all kinds of content is posted in social media people who come across these practices are influenced to do them . One of these practices is smoking .
                                                                            we have come across many people in our life who smoke. Smoking not only damages their health but also is more toxic when someone breaths in the released smoke. cigars, cigarettes, E-cigarettes leaves a black residue in your lungs and when continued for a long time makes a person hard to breath, smoking can also cause lung cancer, mouth cancer and so on... . Not only this smoking also cause brain strokes and heart attacks. when a person is addicted to smoking he may get mentally affected. and YES , I agree to ban smoking in all the restaurants in a country, and I'm totally against to people who do that.
