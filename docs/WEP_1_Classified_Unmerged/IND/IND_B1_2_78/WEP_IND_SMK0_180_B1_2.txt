My opinion is somewhat different in this topic , i prefer staying neutral . we can see that there are huge amount of chain smokers in our country  , who smokes more that 10 plus ciggarettes a day which is obviously not healthy. there are many surveys which conducted several test on chain smokers and the conclusion of this survey was that , this habit is very difficult to control . i also agree that smoking in public places may make many people uncomfortable who are not habitual of this smoke but banning it can't solve the issue . i prefer making seperate  section for people who smokes after every hour and so or for the people who want to refresh their minds . keeping this section away from the family section would be worth . as , the family with their children can enjoy their meal and have a great time . there are several restaurants who follow the same procedure and manage all kind of people . banning alone can't solve the actual problem , because such people will start smoking anywhere in the public if they are not provided with specific place . where they can fresh up their minds
