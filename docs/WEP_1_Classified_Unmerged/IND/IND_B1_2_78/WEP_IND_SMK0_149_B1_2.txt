SMOKING KILLS:  We see the disclaimer everywhere in the county including streets,cinema halls,boardings etc. saying that Smoking kills! But what's the change that happened in the country? Every small step towards the ban of tobacco and cigarette counts. One of the smallest step that can be taken is banning cigarettes in restaurants.we may look at it  as a neglected idea but it can influence a lot. We see that many restaurants provide a bar and a smoking area. Also, there are many cafes and places near schools and colleges which sells tobacco and cigarettes. Although its a business strategy to have these areas near crowded places, It would to be a trap for the school and college going students to get attracted and addicted to it. Even in family restaurants, we see a separate smoking area which can have an impact on the children. They doesn't realise that it is harmful and smoking is very normalised in the society that even the parents doesn't punish their child if they're caught smoking or drinking. These can be the very first steps to many serious addictions and can spoil the bright future of the child.Not only the children and the youth, even adults are addicted to smoking and they doesn't realise the consequences and health issues they face and doesn't think about the impact it has on their family.
