As a college student myself having a part-time job has exponentially changed my life. The chance to enhance your skills, ability to earn your own money, and take care of your own expenses boosts our confidence a lot. Students working part-time is very common in foreign countries, I am happy to see it being implemented in India too. This not only gives much needed experience to the students but also enhances their speaking, listening and social skills. Rather than wasting time on the internet, binge watching Netflix shows, and doom scrolling social media; having a part-time job keeps you busy thus preventing you from these bad habits. It also helps us learn time management skills as a  part of our day will be spent at work. The years you have worked part-time can be mentioned in your resume boosting your chances of getting a full-time job. If you earn well enough with your part-time job you can lift some weight off your parents in terms of finance. There are, at the moment, many options to work for part-time, some of them are: telling tuitions to school kids, working part-time in restaurants, freelancing, working at mee-seva centers, working as a part-time delivery partner, doing a internship.
