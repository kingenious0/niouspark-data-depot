Smoking is one of the most deadliest addictions on the planet. The extremely cryogenic nature of it is terminal to human life. The worst part is that it's adverse effects are as effective to people around the smoker as it is effective to himself. When smoke produced from cigarettes is inhaled by people around it does damage to the lungs as if they themselves have smoked a pack. This is a serious issue which needs to be addressed immediately. This issue is mostly observed at restaurants where family come to enjoy some good food but are exposed to such harmful fumes. The damage done by the smoke to our lungs is not curable and in worst case can lead to lung cancer as well. It is also important to note that many are allergic and suffer coughs and other reactions when exposed to cigarette smoke. Continuing to surrender to the habit of smoking without realizing that it is effecting the people around you should be considered a crime. Smokers cannot stop their habit all a sudden so we need to come up with some other alternative. One of the solution to this is to provide a separate smoking section far from the tables at restaurants and banning the act of smoking near the tables. With this the ill effects can be reduced by a lot and our families and kids can be safeguarded from this vicious addiction.
