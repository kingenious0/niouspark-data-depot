I completely agree with the statement tha students should hve a part time job. consideringÂ  all the expences the students need to make are really very high in these days. so as to save a little expences for their parents and to support them financially even its a little bit .not only about the money or expenditures one can gain the knowledge of trying new things and get the experiene of doing some part time jobs can be very helpful for the students. it helps them in various situatons. helps them in becoming financially independent and become a litl aware of the expenditures and become a bit responsible about their expenditurs and all financial things. students will be able to gain a little knowledge in aspect through their part time job and helps them in gaining a little experience in their field any thing it could be it gives them freedom to earn and spend freely so they can fee the reality of life and earning to spend. Students with part time job becom responsible and have to be more discipline to go to work and answer to their boss it also heps them meet people who can hep them get jobs in the future and maybe make good relationships with them
