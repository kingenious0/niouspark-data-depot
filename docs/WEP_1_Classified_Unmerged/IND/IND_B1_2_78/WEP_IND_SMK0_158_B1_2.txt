"Smoking is a health hazard and has many ill effects on the human organs. It causes adverse effects 
on health which lead to serious health issues.  
I firmly believe that smoking should be completely banned in all the restaurants in the country. 
Firstly, smoking not only affects the person who is smoking but also causes discomfort to the people 
around. A restaurant is a public place where people generally come to have some good time with 
families or friends. A smoke free atmosphere makes more enjoyable and safer experiences for 
diners. Children and elderly people face serious discomfort. It also has affect on the business of the 
restaurant. A smoke free environment in the restaurant can help promote the business. It also 
reduces air pollution though smoking might have a very little contribution to the air pollution. It also 
gives a pleasant, fresh and inviting atmosphere for customers and gives a better hospitality. Smoking 
causes respiratory problems and has many other ill effects on health. It also reduces the air quality 
of the atmosphere in the restaurants. Smoking can also cause accidental fires in the restaurant. 
Smoke free restaurants are preferred more. Restaurants banning smoking can influence other 
businesses or institutes to follow and inculcate social responsibility among everyone. 
A complete ban on smoking in restaurants is essential for protecting public health, improving 
cleanliness and thereby providing a pleasant atmosphere for everyone in the surroundings. It also 
reminds social responsibility among people. "
