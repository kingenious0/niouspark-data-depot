"I strongly agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants across the country.  To begin with, the adverse health effects of secondhand smoke are documented. The World Health Organization has recognized secondhand smoke as an enemy to health pertaining to several diseases, among them cancer, respiratory infections, and heart disease. Thus, whenever a restaurant permits smoking, the patrons who are non-smokers expose themselves to the harmful effects of secondhand smoke, causing harmful effects in themselves, and, thus, a complete ban would save the health of these non-smokers and restaurant staff in the process of barring smoking altogether, conserving a safer environment.
 Many people would prefer to eat in a clean and nice environment. Smoke can stay in the air and on clothing, detracting from what should otherwise be an enjoyable dining experience. As an example, where restaurants have a smoking area, the smoke usually drifts into the non-smoking sections, leaving the non-smokers in discomfort and searching for other dining places. Having a policy of no smoking would ensure a larger clientele, for families and those conscious of health mostly do not patronize restaurants that do not support their comfort and well-being. 
In addition, several countries have successfully implemented smoking bans in public places like restaurants and enjoyed the fruits of such interventions. Following these bans, countries such as Australia and the UK have noticed a significant reduction in smoking prevalence as well as improvements in the health of the general public. This indicates that a nationwide ban on restaurant smoking should render benefit in the long run to society. In short, a restaurant smoke ban is a much-needed intervention toward the protection of public health, dining comfort, and wellness at large. "
