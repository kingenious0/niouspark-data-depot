Yes, I do agree that it is important for college students to have a part time job, as it financially strengthens them, which can be used to meet their daily needs and also reduces an amount of responsibility on their parents, The part- time job doesn't only strengthen them financially but also strengthens their skill on the basis of their work. It also makes them to stand as an independent in the society. It also allows them to understand how society works, how people around them live. Having an part time job increases their responsibilities as an student, child and as an employee also. It helps and trains them to manage their time for their daily activities like studying, working as a part- time employee and to spend the time with family too. It gives the experience of working in the early stages and allows them to work hard for their goals. A part- time job also allows to succeed them in their early ages. The amount of mistakes they make, makesÂ  them to correct themselves. It thus has so many benefits and in our country too it must be allowed. So that the students. will have all the benefits and satisfaction of earning and supporting themselves.
