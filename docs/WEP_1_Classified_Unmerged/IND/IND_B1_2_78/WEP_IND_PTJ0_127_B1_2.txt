"I believe that having a part-time job during college is important for several reasons. As, it teaches
students how to manage their time more effectively. Although balancing studies and a job can be
challenging, but it becomes possible by prioritizing tasks and staying organized.  Another reason,
apart from time management, is the financial benefit. College can be expensive, and students often
have additional expenses, such as buying books. A part time job can help cover these costs, and
there are some students who don't like to rely on parents for pocket money, so part time can be
helpful . Moreover, having work experience can make students more responsible and provide
valuable experience in working with people. Even if the part-time job is not directly related to the
student's major, it can help improve interpersonal skills, which are crucial for adapting to any work
environment. Though I haven't worked part-time, I've seen one of my friends working part time in a supermarket.
While it wasn't related to her major, she gained skills like teamwork and customer service, which
helped her improve her overall skill set. So, it is important for college students to have a part time
job as it provides financial support, real world experience, and essential skills like teamwork, confidence and
time management."
