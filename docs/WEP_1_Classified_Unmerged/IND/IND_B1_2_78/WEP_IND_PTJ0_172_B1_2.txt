 "It is important for college students to have a part-time job." I Disagree with this statement. It is not must and important to have a part time job as a college student, As a student I believe that  the most important thing as a student is working on our studies. Part time jobs are not that securing for future and it only aims on gaining money. It may lead to distraction because the student is aiming for money.   If we just give our best in acedemics we may excel in it and secure a better place in career. Instead of choosing a part time job a student can do any intership as it will help in boosting confidence and also productive experience. There are a lot other benfits of joining an Internship.  This diagreement is due to the word importatnt given in this statement as it is definetly not a important  though if a student can manage both part time and studies they can continue doing it. This statement can be jugjed depening on students perspective. As I believ that the possibity of a student not looking at their studies seriously but atking it light for the money that they are getting at that moment will effect the students education and grades badly. so i strongly disagree to the idea of students doing aprt time jobs.
