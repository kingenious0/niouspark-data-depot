 The government should take strict actions to stop smoking in order to protect public health, reduce healthcare costs, and create a smoke-free society. Firstly, implementing stringent regulations and restrictions on smoking can help prevent the initiation of this harmful habit, particularly among young people. By imposing age restrictions, increasing taxes on tobacco products, and enforcing comprehensive advertising bans, governments can discourage individuals from starting to smoke in the first place.

Furthermore, the government should invest in comprehensive smoking cessation programs to support individuals who want to quit smoking. These programs can provide counseling, access to medications, and other resources to help smokers overcome their addiction. By offering these services free of charge or at affordable rates, the government can increase the chances of successful quitting and improve public health outcomes.

In addition to education and cessation programs, the government should enforce strict regulations on smoking in public spaces. Prohibiting smoking in indoor areas, parks, beaches, and other public venues not only protects non-smokers from secondhand smoke but also sends a clear message that smoking is not acceptable in society. Strict enforcement of these regulations through fines and penalties will further deter smokers from lighting up in prohibited areas.

Moreover, increasing public awareness campaigns about the dangers of smoking and the benefits of quitting can play a vital role in changing societal attitudes towards smoking. The government should invest in compelling advertising campaigns, public service announcements, and educational initiatives to educate the public about the harmful effects of smoking and the available resources for quitting.
