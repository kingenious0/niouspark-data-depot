I believe smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants in the country. Eating out is something many people enjoy, and everyone deserves to do it in a clean and healthy place. When someone smokes in a restaurant, it doesn't just affect them it affects everyone around them. Secondhand smoke can be very harmful. It can cause serious health problems like breathing issues, heart disease, and even cancer. It’s especially dangerous for children, older people, and people with asthma. When someone smokes near others, those people are forced to breathe in the smoke, even if they don’t want to. That’s not fair. Restaurant workers are also at risk. They spend many hours at work and shouldn’t have to breathe in smoke just to earn a living. Everyone has the right to work in a safe and healthy place. Some people say smokers should have the freedom to smoke, but freedom should not hurt others. Smokers can still smoke in private or designated areas, but restaurants are shared spaces. The health and comfort of everyone should come first. Also, many people prefer going to restaurants that are smoke-free. It makes the air cleaner, the food taste better, and the place more enjoyable for families and friends. In the end, banning smoking in all restaurants is a smart and fair choice. It protects people’s health and makes dining out better for everyone. A smoke-free restaurant is a better restaurant for workers, customers, and even the environment.
