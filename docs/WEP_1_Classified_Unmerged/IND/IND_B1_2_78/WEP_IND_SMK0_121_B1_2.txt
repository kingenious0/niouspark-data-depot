I strongly do agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Firstly, we all know that it is very injurious to health as written on the pack itself so allowing it especially in public places like restaurants doesn't make any sense. People who don't smoke live longer than the ones who smoke. For many people who smoke, it might give them a temporary satisfaction and pleasure and in the process few become very addictive to it in but in the long run it is dangerous to their own health and life. There is also a chance of suffering from throat cancer which can cause due to smoking. The smoke which releases while smoking can cause a lot of inconvenience to other people in the restaurant by causing difficulty in breathing and it can mix with the food as well. To restaurants, not just adults but kids and older people also do come, students with their friends, families, etc. Seeing such activities can create a bad influence for kids and students  who are very young. It can also lead to a lot of trouble to older people and also to the people who suffer with breathing issues like asthma, etc. Therefore, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country.
