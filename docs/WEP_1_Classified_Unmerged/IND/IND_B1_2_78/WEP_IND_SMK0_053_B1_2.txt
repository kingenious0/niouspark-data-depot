Smoking nowadays has become a popular practice amongst the natives of India. It the most common issue of today's society. Besides knowing the fact that it is really harmful and effective for our health, especially internal organs, people continue this practice as they get addicted to it and it becomes difficult for them to cut off from this. Public places, such as restaurants, are allowing their customers to smoke in their restaurant so as they would increase the number of visitors to their restaurant. Some people are in favour of this statement, whereas, others are totally in contrast of it. I also believe that smoking should be banned in restaurants or public areas as it not only harm the smoker itself but also to the people they are surrounding to. Restaurant is a public as well as family suitable place. So, whenever families arrive with their children, the smoke would get spread in the whole hallway with the help of air conditioner as it would circulate it to the entire enclosed area. Children are more prone to catch this smoke more quickly then the elders. It would really damage their respiratory system. Therefore, these aforementioned reasons would justify my opinion on banning of smoking in restaurants or public places.
