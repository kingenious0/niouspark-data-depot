"                       Students who just completed their high school education and are going to pursue their higher education will be excited to experience everything. As they are about to enter into their adulthood they should be aware of how money works and how should they use it sustainably . I really think that it is really important for college students to have a part-time job cause this helps a student to live independently and not on others or their parents. This is the time when students work on their carrier in private or in group a student  should be in a place where he can make decision on his one while putting his budget on something. a student gets to know his expenses, how much is he earning? , where is he spending his expenses? , what are his savings ? etc. 
                              In this world where every one run after living comfortably or in luxury. one should be saving his money.  With the money one earns from working in part-time jobs a student an buy his study requirements like books, laptops. He can also use it to study hubs, on food . For the students who live away from their parents or students who left their country can afford a place to stay and not only this one can also visit their parents once in a while rather than depending on their parents money
