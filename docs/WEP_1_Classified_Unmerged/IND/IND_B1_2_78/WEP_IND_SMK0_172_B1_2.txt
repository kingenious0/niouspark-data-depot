"Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country."  I agree with this statement. Smoking is injurious to health and it is unhealthy  to the person who is breathing the smoked out air.  And restaurant is a place where people come to eat and when the smoked air get in the food place the food will  also get poluted and it is very unhealthy to people consuming the food.  Imagine a person smoking in a restraunt it is going to effect the person himself, the people areound him and  the air which is polluted gets into the food eaten by  others. Here we can see that a lot of people smoke even thought it is contagious to our health.  we could have a dfferent room in restraunt which is closed and would not effect someone else. As this is a serious concern to someone who is pure and healthy and not addicted to smoking, Action needs to be  done on this. Even when we make a smoking room in the restaurants there is many chances that from the room also the smell comes out and with this smell only the others who are not smoking will also get their health affetced.
