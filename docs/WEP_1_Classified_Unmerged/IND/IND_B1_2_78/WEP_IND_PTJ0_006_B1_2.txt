 In my personal opinion  , I think that students should have a part time jobs because nowdays every student want to earn money along with their studies . earning money is a basic need of today life. the student whose have a part time jobs along with their studies can complete and fullfil their basic needs . everything is become costly day by day.  it is also beneficial so that student can hold their on expenses by themselves. it also help to interact with people. students also build their skills during the part time jobs. part time jobs help financially, socially. due to this students know how to manage money, how to deal with the vendors. it also deal with how to manage time.  due to part time jobs students know the life obstacles and major financial issues. it gain student confidence and skills. when students earn own money they become independent. this improve students communication skills and how  to interact with team work. this also help to manage time between social life, study and their job.  You will learn how to handle responsibilities. Being a good student takes a lot of responsibility but if you learn how to balance school studies or activities and a part-time job, you will learn the true meaning of responsibility.
                                                         In conclusion, students must have a part time jobs along with their studies beacuse it improve their many skills and become independent.
