"Firstly, part-time jobs can provide experience of a particular nature that will employ the student résumé, i.e., skills students look for at work. 
Many employers want employees to be knowledgeable in functional or experiential aspects of the job, and that would naturally give an upper hand to students with part-time jobs. For instance, a student does not only learn how to serve customers through retail experience but also learns about teamwork and time management, both of which are vital in any career endeavor. 
Moreover, it teaches the students some basic life skills. With work and study, the students are expected to learn how to manage their time aptly, which they would need in their careers someday. Most importantly, dealing with finances, budgeting for expenditure or savings not only increases a student's independence but also increases financial acumen which is often neglected in the formal classroom setting. On the contrary, some people might be of the opinion that part-time jobs distract students from their studies.
 However, it has been noticed in many cases that bringing in income teaches students to focus and be productive. The very realistic need to manage their time can motivate them to spend it wisely, prioritizing their academic responsibilities and achieving excellent study habits. All in all, having such employment for students in college proves very helpful in aiding experience, which promotes growth both personally and professionally. Yes, they will have to juggle their time carefully, but the skills and lessons they learn through a part-time job will be invaluable for future endeavors.
 Flexible and accomplished at the same time, theory and practical learning prepare students to roam into the demanding and ever-changing job market."
