College is often described as a time for growth, freedom, and learning not just from books, but from life itself. In my opinion, one of the most underrated parts of that experience is having part time job. It’s about learning things no classroom can really teach.                                                                      Working a job teaches responsibility, waking up early for a shift dealing with different types of people, managing stress.It teaches discipline. Jobs force us tobalance and plan and that’s a life skill we will need long after college ends also part time work helps us build confidence we start trusting ourselves more I think that confidence is what helps turn students into adults not age                                                                        Another thing that matters is independence earning your own money also builds independence , spending money you worked for makes you think twice before buying something you don’t need . It teaches budgeting in a way no app or class ever could                                                             Having a job helps students connect with different walks of life it help us in exposure builds empathy and people skills something every career needs. Ofcourse the balance is important. A job shouldn’t mess with our studies or mental health. But when balanced  it can help students become more organized and mature and to enhance college life. So yes  I believe part time jobs are more than just money makers .Its quiet teacher, shaping students for the real world in the most unexpected way
