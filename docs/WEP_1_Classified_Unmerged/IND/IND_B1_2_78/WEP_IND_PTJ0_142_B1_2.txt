Yes, I agree that a college should have a part-time job, so as to get some knowledge around the world and can get some awareness about the surrounding situation and society. Not only for this for a student during his college days he/ she might be feeling ashamed to ask for money from their parents .So if they start any part- time job they can get some money through it and can fulfill their needs without depending on their parents. And if they join any part- time job there will be a chance of getting socially connected with many people and can gain experiences and can get to know about their standards and their family standards, so that they can realize their significant role in carrying the family and its expenses. Not only on part- time they should also focus on their goals and skills which they strive for. Part time job does not only give them salary but also teaches them the life lessons.  And they will get to know about the profits and losses in the business in which they work at. At the end I say that everyone (students) who seek for a part time job should go and have it so that they can get a clarity in their life too.. As they should work one  or the other day, so they can gain atleast  some thing from the job or else it will be fine to not to work during college days.
