I think it is important for college students to have a part time job because first of all the students will help them. If the student  want to do the job they should must do the part time job and it's something they should must do then he or she has no option left and they should must do the part time job but according to me the student should do the job. It is help the student in many ways. It is good to have part time job and it is good for job. The student will learn in job and will learn in the job. The student will do the job is good for the student and for the job good. The student and father mother good for job. Money for family good for job. I agree for job as I get to money. I get money spend money all happy. I want job, if I get I het job I happy job doing. I want to job so I get job my father mother happy job. All job money getting happy time job. I agree for student job and study must happened. Job is good good money happy.
