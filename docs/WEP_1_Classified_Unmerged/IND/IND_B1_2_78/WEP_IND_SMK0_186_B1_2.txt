I strongly agree that smoking should be banned from all the restaurants  in the country because smoking is very dangerous for the human being. Smoking is dangerous for the one who is consuming it and also for the person who is near to the person because when the person who is smoking is also making the people near him inhale that bad gas and making their health bad too. Smoking is literally killing people of the country and something like this should must be banned from the country. the advantages of banning smoking are very much the country will be more healthier and pollution free and also it is good for each and every person in this country. The health issues caused by smoking will be reduced and at a point it will be none which somehow help the country to develop more and it is a very good decision for the country development the people of country will be healthier. smoking causes global problems also and hence if we ban smoking in the country our environment will also be clean and neater and healthier. There are a lot of advantages of banning smoking in the country it is a very hard decision but the decisions which hard to take are the best decisions
