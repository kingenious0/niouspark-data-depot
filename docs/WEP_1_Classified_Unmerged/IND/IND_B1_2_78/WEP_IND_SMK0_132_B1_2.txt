"Smoking in restaurants has a significant health threat to both smokers and non smokers alike. Due to this i strongly agree that smoking must be banned in all restaurants across the country. In some cases a single cigar causes a huge accidents in the kitchen leading to sacrifices to human life’s and property loses.
                                         The primary reason is the stance for public health and smoke contains numerous toxic chemicals, which increases the chances to get seriously ill (like respiratory problems, cancer, heart diseases etc..) for people who are exposed to the smoke. In the dining area of the restaurants people basically gather to eat and socialize, but the smock spreads bad odour across the restaurant endangering not only the smoker but also including non smokers and staff and any other.
                                     For this reason smoking ban promotes a healthier life style and encourages smokers to quit their habit of smoking to contributing to improve an ideal society. It also creates a more pleasant dining experience for non smokers who can enjoy their meals without any interruptions and dis comfort.
                                                          Some people argue that a ban destroys and interrupts individuality and freedom. However the right to smoke shouldn’t prioritize over the right to breath clean air.
                                               In conclusion, a nationwide smoking ban in restaurants is a very crucial step which leads towards safeguarding public health and promoting a healthier environment. While individual freedom of people is important, they must be balanced with need to protect them well being of the entire community as well.   "
