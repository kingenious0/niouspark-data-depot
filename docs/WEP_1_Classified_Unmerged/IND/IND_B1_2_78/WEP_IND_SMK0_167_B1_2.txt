Yes,  I do agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, as many people who smoke and the people around them are also effected with many major health issues like Respiratory diseases, Lun cancers, skin allegies etc. Mostly children are effect by these. Due to the people who smoke, children often get influenced by them  and start to smoke at a very young age. Students and youth are easily to take up this habit. It is making mny to get attracted as it is shown as a regular habit for many heroes in the movies. looking at this kind of things in the movies makes younger people to take the habit and spoil the health. Restaurants are the places which are visited by all the people. They are the places which are visited by families for celebrationing some events. so, if they allow people to smoke , it will cause a bad effect on the people who are present at that time. Kids and children will not know the badness of this and they easily try to take up the habit. So to put an end to all this and keep the kids and younger people not to take this habit it is better to stop peope smoke in restaurants.
