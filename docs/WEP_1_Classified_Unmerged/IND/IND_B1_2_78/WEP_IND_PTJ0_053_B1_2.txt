College life is the most remarkable and joyful moment in everyone's life. It exposes us to a whole new phase of life that would remain with us until our death. When a person arrives in this phase of life, they are supposed to become independent and often stand by themselves. It is the last stage of an individual to step into their ideal careers. Few people are against the fact that it is important for college students to do part time jobs,whereas, the others are in favour of this statement. According to me, it is crucial for an individual to step into earning their living by themselves. If not much, atleast the college fees or the clothes or other expenses such as food and drinks should be afforded by themselves. This practice would turn them into a pre-matured person. It would even help them to find more about themselves that what kind of person they are or what they actually want to do or become in their life. Part time jobs would also make them a responsible human being and they would always be ready to face the life challanges in advance. From the aforementioned statements, it can be concluded that college students must do a part time job.
