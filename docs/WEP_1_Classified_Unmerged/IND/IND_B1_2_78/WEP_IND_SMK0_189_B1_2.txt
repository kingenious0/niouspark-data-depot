i strongly agree with the statement that smoking in  public  places like restraunts and all. it not only discomforts the customers but also stands as anti socail activity.it disturbs ones meal whn they are having thier meal time and that interepts their personal time. it is like vadilating the publics space and also discomforting them in the public plac where they have come to have thier family time or thier self time . it also ruins ones interest to have thier meal ans also thier health even if its no them who a smoking but aslo their comfort zone in a way it means that whoever is smoking is using their action to cause harm or discomfort for others so pubic care is not kept in mind by them this is disrespectful to the people around and shows that social responsibility is missing in the smoker. It is a space fr a s it shud be comfortable for everyone nt just those who are smoking. Smetimes someone can have heath issue and maybe eating nearby and the smoke makes it worse for them this is risky and who can take responsibility for this to avoid situations ike this and to show respect t a the pepe in shared spaces, it is important to ban smoking in  public  places
