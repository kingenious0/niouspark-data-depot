"A college student’s life is hectic. They must attend college for a continuous 8 hours. Furthermore, if a student chooses to have a part-time job, it becomes even more hectic for them. Thus, I do not agree with the idea that college students need to work a part-time job.
A part-time job can be in any field, irrespective of the student’s area of study. So, even if a student is burning the midnight oil to manage both, it will not provide them with long-term benefits. It may fulfill immediate needs, but it could negatively affect their academics. If the part-time job is unrelated to their field, it will not contribute to their future growth either.
It is not just future growth or academics that are affected, but also the student's health, which is most important. Students are already exhausted by long college hours. If they are required to work a part-time job as well, their health will surely deteriorate. They would not get enough time to eat properly or take care of themselves. They also would not get enough rest. This can affect both their mental and physical health.
Therefore, I do not think it is important for college students to work part-time jobs, as their overall health should come first. After all, students are the building blocks of every nation."
