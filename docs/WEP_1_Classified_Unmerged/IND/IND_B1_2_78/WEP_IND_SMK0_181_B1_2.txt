I strongly  disagree with this statement because firstly smoking is stylish and also the youth of our country are getting the habit of smoking which will progress lead to our country. When people smoke in public places the other people get to know smoking. Habits like smoking are passed to others by involving them in peer pressure and due to influence from friends these smoking habits will affect families.  Nobody is force to smoke they spoke on wish to smoke. So smoking is not forcing anyone. If one want to smoke they must smoke no force to smoke but one enjoys smoke they must do it. No one should stop them to smoke. They should smoke if one want. When people smoke in public places the other people get to know smoking.  Nobody is force to smoke they spoke on wish to smoke. The one smoke knows he is smoking and he do it with knowing and why should he be stopped. He is not force to smoke someone he is smoke he like smoking. So smoke is not banning in all places. One should have one place outside home to smoke also. It is important to have smoke place outside. If it is banned it is difficult.
