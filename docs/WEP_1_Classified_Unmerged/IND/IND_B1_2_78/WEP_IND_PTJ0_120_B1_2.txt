Yes, I think it is essential for college students to have a part-time job, while they are still pursuing their education. It has many advantages, starting with the experience we would get before joining a company, or just getting the hows and dos of what it needs to run a company if the student is interested in building a company himself. Along with that, there will be the personal growth of the student – if he does internships or part-time jobs in the correct environment. The amount of knowledge that one gains if they do jobs / internships is quite different and more than the ones just studying. It will provide them with a real-life experience as to what their future looks like. One of the most important aspects of having a part-time job is that if the student utilizes it perfectly, he/she have the bright prospect of networking with many expert professionals who would help the student. The student would also learn the importance of time management and how crucial it is for working professionals. These are all the values a student would learn if they have a part-time job while studying. And to top it all off, they will also get the financial help required for them, if they want to pursue studies in the future or for their well-being. Although it would not be much, it would still help the students in many things. Hence, I think it is better for the students to have a part-time job while still in college.
