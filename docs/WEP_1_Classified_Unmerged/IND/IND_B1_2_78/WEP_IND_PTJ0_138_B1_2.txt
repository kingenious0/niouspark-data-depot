"In my opinion, having a part-time job is essential. Some people claim that students focus should be solely academic. There are so many reasons why part-time jobs are an important part of a student's life-it serves almost every way possible, from earning money to personal development as well as time management.

For one, having a part-time job enables students to learn about responsibility in other areas of life. They cover everything from customer service to teamwork and even multitasking, as most jobs require. A typical example is when a student works as a barista, where he or she has to learn how to communicate with customers, manage cash, and cooperate with other team members during a busy shift. These experiences will not only benefit him or her quickly after employment but also form the basis for future professional development.

Furthermore, part-time jobs also teach students how to manage their time well. By juggling academics and jobs at the same time, students would have to learn how to prioritize their appointments and create a schedule. For instance, a student who works for 20 hours a week would have to learn to identify how much time is required on average for studying, attending classes, and perhaps even engaging in extracurricular activities. This discipline will not only ensure a better performance academically but also prepare them for more demanding schedules in their careers.


With that in mind, experience hasn't anything else-the part-time job experience as a student is just that experience, thus important. From improving necessary skills to time management betterment and relieving financial tension, everything that is possible is happening in the part-time jobs to develop a well-rounded, competent graduate, well-prepared for future challenges."
