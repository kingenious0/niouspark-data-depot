"I fully endorse the concept of a nationwide smoking ban in all restaurants. A policy like this would dramatically improve  public health and the dining experience. It would limit secondhand smoke exposure, making restaurants safer for both customers and employees. A smoke free environment would also attract a larger consumer base, supporting corporating growth. This approach is consistent with the global trend towards healthier living and reflects a commitment to putting public well being ahead of personal choice. To summarize, a statewide prohibition on smoking in restaurants is an important step towards building a healthier, safer and more inclusive dining environment. Other from these advantages, a smoking ban in restaurants would be consistent with growing environmental health awareness and pollution reduction. Cigarette smoking not only hurts human health but also contributes to air pollution, affecting both indoor and outdoor air quality. Restaurants may contribute to a cleaner and healthier atmosphere for everyone by establishing a complete smoking ban. It is critical to resolve any concerns about individual liberty. Personal decisions are vital, but they should not jeopardise the well-being of others. A smoking ban protects the right of nonsmokers to breathe clean air while still allowing smokers to enjoy their habit in designated areas outside of restaurants. Finally, a nationwide smoking ban in restaurants is a step forward towards a safer and healthier society. A prohibition like this benefits everyone by protecting public health, attracting more customers, and promoting environmental well-being. This policy shows society's commitment to progress by reflecting an overall shift towards preferring collective benefit over personal preferences. Thank you very much.
