It is important for college students to have a part-time job." I partially agree with the statement that part time job is really important for college students because until and unless there is pressure from the college to pay the college fees. Not everyone in the family can pay the college fee because everyone has some financial issues, condition apply if he/she is studying in reputed or top-class college if they do so and have financial issues then he/she should have to part time job in order to pay the college fee. There is my friend who had some issues financially and his college fee also was too high actually in the Indian college until and unless you pay the total fee, he/she is not allowed to sit in the class this was the main reason that my friend had to do the part time job it may be any job like freelancing if one has some good technical skills. This can help him to pay the college fee and giving less burden to the family.  At last, I would like to conclude that doing part time job may differ to person to person if he/she is financially weak then they will work or there are some people who have passion to work.
