Yes I do agree with it every student should do part time job to improve there life skills and start there income Part time job gives more technical knowledge and experience for real time job and it acts as a good base for industrial experience for real time projects.Students get a motivation to work with projects and new things so that they will not find it deficult when they enter to the out side copitative world ,they start there earning in a early age for there well-being.knowledge they gain is more important.partime helps in many other ways as well it makes studends to learn many new things as well .collage should provide some intenships and some partime jobs to the students who are intersted in them to upbring them and there skill as well. I prefer doing partime jobs as they tell us how to work with them in real time and enhance skills as well we should do partimes to earn our own money without depending on others for our use .we shold start working from now to get better in out job in futhure. Part time jobs are not just making a student to lern many skills thaey also make you get life skills which are needed in this world to survive. So, I vote for studnets doing part tiem jobs.
