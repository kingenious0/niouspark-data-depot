Yes, I strongly agree with the statement given above, because college students are grown ups and newly become adults and should find a source of income like doing some side hustles, for example like doing part time job or working as an intern. By this way they can gain some experience and improve themselves for being job ready. When graduation completes, they can easily get a job and find a source of income. Also by doing part time jobs one's family can depend on them. And one's parents can get retire early. By doing part time jobs, they can acquire other skills as well and also make some connections with the industrialists, businessmen, and also with some of their colleagues. The possibilities are limitless that one can grow to the heights of becoming an assistant manager, Directing manager, Chief executive officer, Chief Co- ordinater, etc,.. One can start a start up company and grow with the company as one of the big giants in the world.
