"Smoking is undeniably one of the leading causes of health issues and environmental degradation in India. While smoking bans have been implemented in several public places, including some restaurants, these restrictions are not uniformly enforced across the country. This inconsistency exposes both smokers and non-smokers to significant health risks. Non-smokers, including restaurant customers and employees, involuntarily inhale second-hand smoke, which can lead to severe respiratory ailments and increased susceptibility to lung and heart diseases.
The harmful chemicals in cigarettes not only affect the smoker but also contaminate the environment, contributing to air and land pollution. Cigarette butts, one of the most common forms of litter, release toxic chemicals into the soil and water, further damaging ecosystems. By banning smoking in all restaurants and public spaces, India could significantly reduce its pollution levels and protect public health.
Countries like the US, Singapore, and Malaysia have successfully implemented strict anti-smoking regulations, setting an example for India to follow. Such measures would not only reduce the nation's smoking-related mortality rates but also improve the overall quality of life. Enforcing the existing provisions of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA), 2003, with greater rigor could play a pivotal role in curbing smoking in public places.
Banning smoking in restaurants would create a cleaner and healthier dining experience for customers, free from the risks of second-hand smoke. It would also uphold the rights of restaurant workers under the Workers Protection Act, safeguarding their health and well-being. Ultimately, a nationwide smoking ban in restaurants would be a progressive step toward promoting a healthier, more sustainable environment."
