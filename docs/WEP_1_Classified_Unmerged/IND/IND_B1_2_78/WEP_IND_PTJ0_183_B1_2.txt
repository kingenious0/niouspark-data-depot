Yes, I agree with that statement. College students are must allowed to do part-time jobs for their beneficial for their future use and for higher accommodation in studies or in jobs they prefer to. They can do any kind of specific jobs which they are interested to. This helps them to improve their soft skills, and much more interests in that particular subject they are into. This helps them also in interviews for technical skills which they can improve and they can even learn of value of earning but their own prosecution. So, I would definitely suggest everyone to do part-time jobs for their own use for further. It's based n an individual interests what they want to choose for their future. By improving their specific skills can lead them to higher potential and standards. It's also same like the basic for your work and to implement these skills anywhere would be also useful. They can even indulge those skills for better enhancement and for better understanding of its skills. So, I would like to support and encourage to do part-time jobs for every individual. They can even develop many projects by those skills and get into companies and offers and can do better enhancement for everyone in the society. Giving opportunities is equal to taking or utilizing  those opportunities so they can get better by part-time job.
