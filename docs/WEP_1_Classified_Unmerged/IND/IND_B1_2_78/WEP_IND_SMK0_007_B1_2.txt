 Yes , I agree smoking should be completely banned in country because it is very injurious to health .Smoking is not effects only that person who use it but it is also effects all the peoples who are near that person . Because of smoking we face many problems and decises. 
Smoking should be banned in not only restaurants it is also banned in all public places like bus stand ,railway station ,college etc.. The idea of banned smoking is very good . 
On the other hand, some people may argue that smoking should not be completely banned at restaurants. They may argue that smokers have the right to smoke and that banning smoking in restaurants is a violation of their personal freedom. Additionally, some may argue that restaurants should have the right to decide whether or not they allow smoking on their premises. Finally, some may argue that smokers are already limited in where they can smoke due to existing laws and regulations, and that banning smoking in restaurants would be an unnecessary restriction.

In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides of the issue, it is important to prioritize public health and safety over individual freedom. Therefore, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country to protect the health of both smokers and non-smokers and to ensure a pleasant dining experience for everyone.
