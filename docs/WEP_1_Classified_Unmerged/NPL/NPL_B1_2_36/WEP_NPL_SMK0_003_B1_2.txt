"Yes, I firmly believe that smoking should be completely banned in all the restaurants across Nepal. Restaurants are public spaces where people of all ages come for eating, relaxing, socializing and enjoying time with friends and family. Allowing smoking in such environments not only harms public health but also creates discomfort and exposes innocent people to toxic substances. The harmful effects of smoking, both direct and through secondhand smoke, are well documented, and creating smoke-free environment in public spaces is crucial for public health. In Nepal- where tobacco use remain prevalent, banning smoking in restaurants will not only protect people from the dangers of smoking but also create a healthier and more comfortable environment for all.
Consider the story of Saanvi, a young woman who frequently visits a local restaurant in Kathmandu. Saanvi is a non-smoker who enjoys dining out with her friends/family. She often finds herself struggling with the discomfort of secondhand smoke, especially in restaurants where smoking is allowed in designated areas. Despite sitting far from the smoking areas, the smell of cigarettes often lingers in the air, making the dining experience unpleasant. They are forced to leave the restaurant before finishing their meal, not because of poor service or food- but because of secondhand smoke. For Saanvi, and many others like her, this is a daily struggle.
 Fortunately, the government is becoming more active in controlling tobacco use. In recent years, there have been many campaigns to increase awareness, and stricter enforcement for no-smoking zones has been promised. If implemented properly, a complete ban on smoking in restaurants would protect public health and promote a cleaner, more comfortable
environment for everyone, helping to attract more customers, especially families, and improve the overall cleanliness and reputation of restaurants.
