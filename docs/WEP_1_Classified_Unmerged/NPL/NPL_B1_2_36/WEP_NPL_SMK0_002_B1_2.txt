"Yes. I agree with the statement. Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. We all know that smoking is very injurious to health. It is the most bad habit of any person. Smoking leads a person to it's addiction. Then, a person cannot avoid cigarette in his/her life as smoking becomes a person's habit. Smoking is a biggest illusion in any person's life as he/she thinks that smoking gives pleasure to the mind and refresh their mood. But there is nothing happening such like that. Yes, smoking gives pleasure to mind but it is so short term pleasure which exists for short period of time. Smoking makes a person to spend more money on cigarettes which is not good for saving money. Smoking also makes a person's brain dull. In all ways, smoking is a bad habit of any person who smokes.

Knowing all the facts why smoking is bad for people is the reason for banning smoking at all restaurants in the country. Restaurants are public places where smoking should not be allowed. When a person smokes in such public places like restaurants can affect other people. It is not good to create problems for other people. Smoking in restaurants can affect children quickly as children learn anything quickly, they may imitate smoking. These are the strong reasons why I agree on banning smoking at all restaurants in the country."
