In our country Nepal people smoke cigarates every where that may occur many problems in surrounging. Also, people more smoke in restaurant, where people go restaurant to eat food but smoker also go their consume food and start smoking they don't thing that nearest people also suffer from the smoking smell. All the Restaurant owners should be sincerely for these problems and make strong rules to avoid smoking in their restaurant and sure to band this in areas. Make strong rules and that must be follow the customers If people break the rules make Punish.
