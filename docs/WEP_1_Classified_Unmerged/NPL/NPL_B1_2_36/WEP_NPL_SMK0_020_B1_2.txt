"Yes, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. One of the main reasons for banning smoking is to protect public health; it is so unfair to non-smokers who choose to live a healthy lifestyle. Smoking not only kills us but it also kills our climate.
Smoking in public places annoys and harms other innocent people. It is really annoying when you are with your family on a special occasion in a restaurant, ordering and having the deliciously looking meal and you smell the cigarette someone is smoking. Also people who do not smoke and only breathe smoke from cigarette take the same amount of chemicals as people who smoke. If smoking will be banned in restaurants, people will begin to smoke less, as they would need to go out to have a cigarette.
Smoking should be banned because it harms health, causes serious diseases and harm air pollution. Smoking can increase the risk of getting lung cancer; it affects the heart and blood circulation which is over time dangerous. If smoking is banned in all restaurants, it will help to improve people's health. Health is the most important thing for people. If you are healthy enough, you can do anything that you want to do."
