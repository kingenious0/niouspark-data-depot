"Yes, I am agreeing it is important for a college students to have a part-time job. As we know that today's world is about technology. Over the past few decades, it has been observed that part-time job is not given to the students. As such this proportion holds both merits and demerits. Although these merits have been believed to outweigh its potential demerits. I will categorically elaborate all the relevant facets based on factual premises and real-life examples.
To begin with there is a possible benefit is that students know about the life expectancy and they have the work experience in their career path many students want to do job but parents cannot give them to do job because they think that they are very small to do work. By doing part-time job students know about the struggle between study and the work which is not easy for the parents it is a part of a study for a student and know about the parent's struggle.
However, a fundamental challenge related to this approach is that students have the mental pressure. Students cannot afford and the struggle between work and the study. Their age is enough but they have a mental pressure about the work. An interdisciplinary team of a scientist has found that it will create a resilient system over the long term.
In conclusion, it can be stated that students should do the part-time job for their future challenges where they faced the easy way how to do and how to success in the future.
