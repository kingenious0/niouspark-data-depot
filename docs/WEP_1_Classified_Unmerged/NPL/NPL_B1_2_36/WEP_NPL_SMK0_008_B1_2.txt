"I believe that smoking should be completely banned in restaurants nationwide. If one person smokes in a room, it negatively impacts everyone present. People come to restaurants to enjoy their favorite dishes, go on a date, or host a business dinner. If one person lights a cigarette, it can disrupt everyone in the restaurant. The smoke not only negatively impacts the smokers, but also everyone else in the room.

Restaurants have customers with varying health conditions. Some suffer from asthma, as cigarette smoke is deadly and can cause immediate health problems. Employees can develop respiratory problems from constant exposure to smoke. Children also come to restaurants. They see supposedly successful people smoking and can be inspired by these smokers. While this is good news for cigarette manufacturers, it is also disastrous for children and their health.

If restaurants cannot ban smoking, they can at least create a special smoking area where smokers can smoke. This way, they do not directly negatively impact non-smokers in the restaurant. Even children do not see them smoking and there is no danger of being inspired by people with bad habits."
