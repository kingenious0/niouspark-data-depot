"           Yes, I agree with the given statement. Restaurants are premises where a lot of people visit to dine. People of all ages go to restaurants to enjoy meals with their family members, relatives, friends, etc.  Smokers as well as non-Smokers go to restaurants to dine.
         Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. It has numerous negative impacts on the people.  Smoking in places like restaurants create a very hazardous atmosphere.  It depletes the atmosphere. 
       The smoke produced by cigarettes and other smoke producing items will affect both smokers and non- smokers . Since restaurants are public places many children, old aged, expecting mothers and diseased visit to experience and enjoy their meals.  The smoke produced by smokers will have a direct impacts on their health. 
        Several youths visit restaurants, when they come across people smoking in such places, it will affect their developmental phase. Hence they are in their transitional period.  There is high possibility of being attracted to a bad habit of smoking.  Many youths indulge in smoking because they considered it to be cool irrespective of the negative effects on their health. 
     The odour produced by the smokers depletes the air in the restaurants which makes it difficult for the non-smokers to enjoy the aroma of the food served to them. The odour of cigarettes and other smoke producing items create an unpleasant environment to the customers who visited the place to enjoy the meals in a fresh environment  . It disrupts the comfort zone of the customers. 
       Banning smoking at all restaurants will also set a good example in the society which may discourage the smokers. It will provide a pleasant environment for the customers which may attract several other customers.  Smoking is injurious for both smokers and non- smokers.  Therefore it should be completely banned at all restaurants in the county.
