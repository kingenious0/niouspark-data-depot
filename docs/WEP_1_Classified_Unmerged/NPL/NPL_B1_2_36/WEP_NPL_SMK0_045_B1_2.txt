Smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants because it harms public health, creates discomfort, and damages the environment. First, smoking in restaurants affects non-smokers' health. Secondhand smoke contains harmful chemicals that can cause serious diseases such as lung cancer and heart problems. Families, especially those with children, should not be exposed to these risks while dining out. Second, smoking makes the restaurant environment unpleasant. Many people dislike the smell of cigarette smoke, and it can ruin the dining experience. Even separate smoking areas do not fully prevent smoke from spreading. A smoke-free restaurant ensures a cleaner and more enjoyable atmosphere for everyone. Lastly, banning smoking helps protect the environment. Cigarette butts are a major source of pollution, often littering restaurant surroundings. This waste is difficult to clean and harms wildlife. A smoking ban can reduce such pollution and promote a cleaner environment. In conclusion, smoking in restaurants should be completely banned to protect public health, maintain a pleasant dining experience, and reduce environmental damage. This policy would benefit both customers and restaurant owners. Smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants.
