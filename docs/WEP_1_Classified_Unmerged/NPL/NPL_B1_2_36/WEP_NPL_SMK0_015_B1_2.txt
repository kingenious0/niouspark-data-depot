I slightly agree with this statement. Smoking is obviously injurious to health and it should not only be banned at all the restaurants but all over the world in my opinion. But, that is definitely something unexpected to happen right at the moment. Talking from the context of Nepal, the government should ban this but it is unlikely as cigarettes are loved by common people and are money source for the nation. In such a condition, applying bans at the restaurants or hotels wouldn't help. The main problem that I face is intensively due to people smoking in public areas like road, bus, parks, temples, etc., also guests at home. If I ever encounter myself with person who is smoking at a restaurant, I simply change my place or I change the restaurant. Now, the question is what if I don't get options to change my place and that's the only restaurant out there at that moment. And this is where I would like to request what if we modify the above mentioned statement to â€“ smoking restaurants should be separately established. This way, we can solve our problems to a great extent rather than completely banning at all the restaurants, as if we apply bans at all the restaurants, people will start smoking openly even more than before.
