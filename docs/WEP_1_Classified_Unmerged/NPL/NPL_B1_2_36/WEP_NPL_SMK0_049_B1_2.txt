I agree that smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants in the country. Banning smoking in all restaurants is important to protect public health, ensure a clean environment, and promote a more enjoyable dining experience for everyone. 
Here are some reasons!
1.	Health Risks: Second-hand smoke poses significant health risks to non-smokers, including increased risk of lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory problems.Banning smoking in restaurants protects patrons and staff from these risks.
2.	Creating a Comfortable Environment: People go to restaurants to relax and enjoy their meals. The smell of smoke can ruin the taste of food and create an unpleasant atmosphere. A smoke-free environment makes dining more comfortable and enjoyable for all guests, including children and the elderly.
3.	Supporting workers' rights: 
Restaurant employees spend long hours in their workplace. If smoking is permitted, they are forced to breathe harmful smoke every day. Banning smoking protects their health and ensures a safer, healthier work environment.
4.	Reduced smoking rates: Banning smoking in public places like restaurants can encourage smokers to reduce or quit smoking, contributing to public health benefits.
5.	Protection of vulnerable populations: 
Children, pregnant women, and people with pre-existing health conditions are particularly vulnerable to secondhand smoke. A ban on smoking helps protect these groups.
6.	In conclusion, implementing a complete ban on smoking in restaurants would promote public health, improve the dining experience, and support a cleaner, safer, and more respectful environment for everyone."
