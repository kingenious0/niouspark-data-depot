"In my opinion having a part time job for college student is very necessary. In fact, college itself should help the student to get the part time job.  A part-time job refers to a position where an employee works fewer hours than a full-time job.  Part time job provide valuable work experience, financial independence, balancing work and studies, time management, and responsibility to the students in better ways.
Working part-time offers benefits outside the classroom and inside classroom. It will help student in different ways like building networks, communication skills, teamwork etc. Managing a job and a full academic load helps student time management skills. In addition to the lectures, homework, and tests that come with college, students learn how to prioritize their duties and maintain a schedule. In the workplace as well as in college, this ability is crucial. Planning and allocating time for both work and school is a requirement of part-time jobs, which teaches students how to perform well under pressure. 
Working a part-time job throughout college can be beneficial, but it also depends on the circumstances, objectives, and ability to combine work, education, and personal obligations of the individual. But definitely 'learning by doing' is the best way to learn and get the knowledge.
