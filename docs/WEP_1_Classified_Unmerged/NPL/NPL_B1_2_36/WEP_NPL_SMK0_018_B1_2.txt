"I completely agree that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. Restaurants are public places where people come to enjoy meals with family and friends. Allowing smoking in such places affects the health and comfort of others, especially non-smokers, children, and elderly people. Second-hand smoke is harmful and can cause serious health issues like asthma, cancer, and heart disease.

Moreover, banning smoking in restaurants helps create a cleaner and more pleasant environment. The smell of smoke can ruin the taste and aroma of food, and cigarette ashes can make the surroundings dirty. When smoking is banned, it encourages more families and health-conscious people to visit restaurants, which can actually increase business. Many countries have already implemented such bans and found positive results in both public health and customer satisfaction.

In conclusion, smoking in restaurants not only harms health but also disturbs the peaceful atmosphere that people seek while dining out. To protect public health and promote clean, welcoming dining spaces, smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants across the country. This step will lead to a healthier and happier society for everyone."
