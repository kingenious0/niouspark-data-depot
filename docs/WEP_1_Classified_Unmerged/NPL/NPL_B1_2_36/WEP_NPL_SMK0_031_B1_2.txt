"Smoking in public places, particularly in restaurants, poses a serious threat to public health and comfort. In Nepal, where awareness about the harmful effects of smoking is growing, it is high time that the government strictly enforces a complete ban on smoking in all restaurants. This step is essential not only to protect non-smokers but also to promote a healthier environment for all citizens.

Restaurants are places where people go to relax, enjoy meals, and spend time with family and friends. However, when someone smokes in a restaurant, it pollutes the air and forces others to inhale toxic smoke. Second-hand smoke is known to cause respiratory problems, heart disease, and even cancer. Children, pregnant women, and the elderly are particularly vulnerable. It is unfair to expose them to such risks while they are simply trying to enjoy a meal.

Moreover, banning smoking in restaurants can contribute to a cleaner and more pleasant atmosphere. It can attract more customers, especially health-conscious people and tourists, thereby benefiting business owners in the long run. Many countries have already implemented such bans and have seen positive results in terms of public health and cleanliness.

In conclusion, a nationwide ban on smoking in restaurants in Nepal is necessary for the well-being of the people. It reflects a progressive step toward a smoke-free society. By protecting public health, encouraging better habits, and promoting a cleaner environment, such a law would be a wise and timely decision."
