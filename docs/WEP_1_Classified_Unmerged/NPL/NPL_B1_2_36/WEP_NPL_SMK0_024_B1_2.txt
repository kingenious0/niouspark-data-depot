"In my point of view, smoking should not be banned in the country because cigarette and tobacco companies provide jobs to thousands of people and contribute to the national economy.  When smoking will be banned, there may arise more issues than benefits. People will start smuggling tobacco products and illegal activities may arise. The people who are employed in tobacco companies may lose jobs and there may be gap in the spending of people. Government implies heavy taxes on tobacco products and this is one of the major sources of income for Nepalese Government. 

Although it may have health issues, it has very minimal impact compared to the health hazards caused by global warming, environmental degradation and pollutions. If government wants to control smoking, they can create awareness and should educate its citizens at the micro-level. Restaurants are the place for relaxation and people go there to get refreshed.  People smoke to get refreshed and relax and get some space from their hectic schedule. Health concerns are the individual perspective, and it combines overall lifestyle the person pursues. 

Generalizing the benefits and problems, I find smoking should not be banned. It creates employment, contributes to national income and offers a form of relaxation to people. Rather than banning, separate smoking zones can be established, so that it will not hamper the non smokers.
