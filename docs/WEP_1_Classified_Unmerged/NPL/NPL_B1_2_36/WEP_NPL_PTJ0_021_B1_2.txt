" I agree that it is important for college student to have a part time job.As part time job is very important as it helps student to manage money for their studies as well as other expenses too.In mine view if student are doing part time job they will be economically strong which will encourage them to be strong and manage every event of their life in proper ways.
    College student to have a part time job also build control communication skills on student,maintain time table,increase skill development and also student can increase their work experience as in today's time work experience is more essential with qualification.Most people think in this way that if college student are doing part time job then they will not get better marks and time to study.But it us not always true because student who are doing part time job are doing well in exam as well as they are managing their time table in better ways.In context of Nepal I have seen example of many students who are doing part time job as well as completing their study in proper way.For example,in my town there was a family who were not economically prosperous where there were four members who survived hard.They only had a small house.Despite the children finished their schooling.Then those people started part time job for further studies and run the family.Slowly the family got economically  better.
So I have a strong belief that college student to have a part time job is a boon for both student and their family.This concept develops independent nature in students with some sort of skill too."
