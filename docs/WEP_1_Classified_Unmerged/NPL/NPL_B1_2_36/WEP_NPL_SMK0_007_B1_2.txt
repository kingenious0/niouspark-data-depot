" At first I am disagree with statement of"SMOKING SHOULD BE COMPLETELY BANNED AT ALL RESTAURANTS IN THE COUNTRY "why only in the restaurant .BUT in my concept we all are living in 21st  century  as I know that all people are aware about side effect of consume smoking . they all know about the its injurious to health and these some product also game the declaimer about smoking

REASON OF DISAGREE

1 If we banned smoking it will impact negative toward the person than its bring mental problem and social problem .

2 In many country tobacco and smoking are playing major role in GDP if its banned we can see economical crisis

3 IN  context of Nepal due to share open broader to India where illegal smuggler activities will increase our money depart to another country than value of currency will fall down

4 Many people will lose there job due to shutdown industrial production of smoking

5 Raw material for smoking will wastes and  farmer will get huge loss

 In the scenario of banned smoking and implement of forceful law to band smoking will make conflict between government and  smoking consumer public. Smoking banded is not very fruitful for all we can work  from roots  not to consume smoking. Like we can work in spreading aware message , slowly government work on them to live healthy life style making them to busy in work. And depend on smoking production convert in another industrial .after many long periods it will give us positive and sustainable result to us .
