Yes, I strongly agree with this statement.  Now, moving on why I find it important for college students to have a part-time job. Being a university student myself, I also crave for my personality development and a certain income reward for my skills. Though, I haven't been involved in any such professions yet because I have day classes and my campus is far from my home, I ride by bicycle and sitting in bus everyday spending 2hrs to go to campus and come back home from there, and my classes hours is the other 5 hrs. Hence, if I had morning classes or would go campus from nearby, I would have definitely got engaged in income-sources activities as well. I am on my first semester and my fellow friends who study in other courses or somewhere else, they have been engaged in work for more than three months already. I being a college student feel really insecure and miserable sometimes. This was about how I relate part time jobs with my emotions. Again, regarding the financial aspects, I am not talking about my tuition or exam fees. Other than that I spend like Rs.150 on a daily basis for my transportation and lunch, drinks, etc. for college. This way, I spend about Rs.4000 to Rs.5000 in a month. So, I have a cue to earn at this age when I am actually able to earn too. Similarly, if I speak about my social responsibility, I am an 18+ girl and government also gave me a PAN card which simply means I am now ready to be independent, to follow my duty towards the country and myself. Also that, I want to help my family.
