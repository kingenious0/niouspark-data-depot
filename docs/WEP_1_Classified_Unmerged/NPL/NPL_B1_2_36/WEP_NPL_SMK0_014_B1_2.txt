"Smoking in restaurants should be totally stopped across the whole country. It's a simple way to make things better for everyone.
First, *it protects people's health*. When someone smokes, everyone around them breathes in that bad air. This can cause serious problems like asthma and even cancer, even if you don't smoke yourself. Restaurants should be places where people can eat and enjoy themselves without breathing in harmful smoke.
Second, *it makes things fair for workers*. People who work in restaurants have to be there for many hours. If smoking is allowed, they have no choice but to breathe in smoke all day. This isn't fair to their health. Banning smoking creates a healthier workplace for them.
Third, *most people don't smoke*. Why should the majority of people who want to eat in a clean air environment have to suffer because a few people want to smoke? Restaurants should cater to what most people want, and that's likely smoke-free air.
Finally, *it's a simple rule to follow*. A complete ban means there's no confusion about where you can and can't smoke. It makes it easier for everyone to understand and for restaurants to enforce.
In short, banning smoking in all restaurants is a clear and easy way to protect the health of customers and workers, and it's what most people would prefer. It's a change that would make eating out a healthier and more enjoyable experience for everyone in the country."
