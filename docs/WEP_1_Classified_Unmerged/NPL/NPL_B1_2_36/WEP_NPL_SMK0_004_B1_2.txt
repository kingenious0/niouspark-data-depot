"Smoking is a harmful habit that poses serious health risks not only to smokers but also to those exposed to secondhand smoke. Despite growing awareness of its dangers, many restaurants still allow smoking, endangering public health. To protect customers and employees, smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants across the country.
Secondhand smoke contains over 7,000 chemicals, hundreds of which are toxic and can cause cancer. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), secondhand smoke causes more than 1.2 million premature deaths annually worldwide. Non-smokers, including restaurant staff and diners, are forced to inhale these harmful chemicals, increasing their risk of lung disease, heart problems, and respiratory illnesses. A smoking ban in restaurants would significantly reduce these health hazards.
Many people, especially families with children, avoid restaurants that permit smoking due to the unpleasant smell and health concerns. Allowing smoking creates an uncomfortable environment and discourages non-smokers from visiting certain establishments. A complete ban would ensure that all customers, including children and elderly individuals, can enjoy their meals in a clean, smoke-free atmosphere.
Some argue that smoking bans hurt restaurant revenues, but studies show the opposite.  Instead, more non-smoking customers visited these establishments, improving business. Additionally, smoke-free environments reduce cleaning costs and lower the risk of fire hazards caused by cigarettes.
Governments have a duty to protect public health. Just as laws prohibit drunk driving and unsafe food handling, smoking in public dining areas should also be illegal. 
Banning smoking in all restaurants is a necessary step to safeguard public health, improve customer satisfaction, and support businesses. The dangers of secondhand smoke far outweigh any perceived benefits of allowing smoking in dining areas. By enforcing a complete ban, the country can promote a healthier, more enjoyable dining experience for everyone."
