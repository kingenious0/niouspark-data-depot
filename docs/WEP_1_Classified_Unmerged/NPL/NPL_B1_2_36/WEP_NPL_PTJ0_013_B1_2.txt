"Yes, in my opinion, having a part-time job is very important for college students. Through the job students can cover their expenses and make them financial independence. Not only that also they can get work experience which makes them confidence in their future life. And also teach them how to manage time and do many tasks in same period.  Because of part-time job students can get chance to meet many different types of people who can help them in their careers. As I think part-time job helps students to build their confidence to face mass as well as makes them responsibility.
There are many examples which can explain part-time job is really important for the students. I just want to share same examples over here. When I was in grade 12, one of my friends who had poor financial condition. She decided to hold a job. As her wished she had got a job in a store. She worked hard and earned enough money because of her job she was able to give good life for parents and also, she could handle her expenses. Same like this there is one example which is my own. When I was starting my job when I was is bachelor 1st year at that time, I really felt hesitate to talk with unknown people but after my job in a school, I got confidence to deal with parents and face the mass. Which is really helpful in my present life.
However, students should not think that job might affect their study but they can help in their careers. And also, they can learn well-balanced life.
