"Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I totally agree with this because it protects public health and reduces environmental pollution and decreases smoking rates.
Smoking is very harmful to health. The smoke, which is exhaled by the smokers contains thousands of toxic chemicals which causes serious diseases like cancer, respiratory diseases, allergies etc. Doing this action, people do not smoke on public places or restaurants which leads to reduce the pollution on environment. It creates clean and fresh atmosphere. Smoking not only harms smokers but also affects non-smokers very badly. According to the research, smoke is equally harmful to non-smokers like how it affects the smokers. Daily exposure of smoking can cause immediate and long-term health problems especially in children and pregnant woman. So, making no-smoke zone results safe environment.
Nowadays, smoking becomes more casual. People do not hesitate to smoke on public places. This causes very bad effect on children and teenagers. They think that it is a fashion or culture and quickly attract towards it by seeing it. By banning smoking, children and teenagers get less exposure to smoking which can prevent them from taking up the habit. They grow up in a smoke-free environment. By seeing this action, other public places would restrict this. Due to this, smoking rates would decline over the time.
At last, smoking should be fully banned in all restaurants to create good environment and public health. For this, government and restaurant owners should make strict policies.
