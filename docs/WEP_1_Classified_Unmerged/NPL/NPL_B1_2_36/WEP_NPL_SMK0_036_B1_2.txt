Smoking has to be banned in all restaurants across the country in order to safeguard everyone's health and to make dining out more enjoyable for one and all. The biggest concern when it comes to smoking in restaurants is the danger of secondhand smoke. Smoke inhalation can cause serious problems like lung disease, heart disease, and even cancer. 
In a closed space like a restaurant, the smoke would easily circulate, making it unsafe for all individuals, including children, pregnant women, and workers. It would be more enjoyable and comfortable to dine out for all individuals if smoking were banned. It would be healthier and cleaner for all customers. No one wants to eat in a place where the air is saturated with the odor of smoke.
In addition, restaurant employees, like cooks and waiters, would also be safer if smoking is banned. They spend long hours in the restaurants, and secondhand smoke can lead to serious health issues in the long term. By banning smoking, we safeguard the health of these employees and allow them to be healthy and productive. It also keeps the youth away from use of harmful substances.
In conclusion, there are several countries around the globe that have already banned smoking in restaurants and other public areas, and it has worked in their favor. Not only has public health improved, but business for certain restaurants actually improved because more individuals were able to dine there comfortably.
