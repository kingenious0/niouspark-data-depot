"AS  in the topic I am disagree about for "collage student to have a part time job". In my opinion collage student must be prepared  for to gain more knowledge about theoretical subjective  and practical way that in future  they can do same jo with perfectly and smartly . due to part time job they cant concern to study .  In the context  of contemporary periods students who are doing part time job In every country are going through labor exploitation . due to exploitation they have  mental  issues like anxiety  depression etc . than they to drop out from collage .

REASON OF DISAGREE

 1  It harms to learning  brain by part time job because of job pressure and responsibility.

2 They cant find educational job and force to unuseful job.

3 DUE  to part time job they cant score good academy score .it harm for life periods.

4 Greed to gain some money ,they will regret and curse to part time job.

5 Investing job time in a study will be more power weapon to student in future .

 Good knowledge  make good person ,to be perfect gain perfect knowledge ,to be specialist in right field you must gain special knowledge . so we must concern to study . student are spinal part of whole world we cant spoil there future by greed part time job .every part of world government responsible to make student educated government should give them right to study .if government gave them good education system than poverty of every country will decrease and student  don't need to part time job.

To bring sustainable and capable student for upcoming future .we must ban part time job for student .
