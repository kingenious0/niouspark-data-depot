"Yes, I agree with the topic it's important for college student to have a part time job because student build their confidence, creativity thinking, time management skill, communication skill and get experience. Student learn how to managed their own finance. the most importantly reduce the stress over parents for your study. They developed their ability to managed their study and their work at the same time. There is some benefit and drawback while working a part time job when you study.
                         Students get real life experience from part time job. Student learn how to interact with people, developing skill and making friend. This help them to get experience from their work, build confidence and maintain discipline in life. Student build mental ability of doing multiple task. Student feel like they can take care of their own expenses and understand their responsibility. They understand of hard work to earn money and how to save money. Student understand how they treat from the society to get a job and extra care from the family for doing a job. The mentality changes of people for you when you doing a job. 
Student worked part time job is good but they affect their health, study and peace. They can't fully concentration on their study because of their work. The level of stress is boost and the frustration of not concentration is high. There is no benefit of part time job as full-time job. there is no job security and no extra benefit and they pay less.
In conclusion student do part time job because this help them to experience of work and the chance to developed their career growth. they learn management skill and skill development."
