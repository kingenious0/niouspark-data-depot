"I do agree that Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. As we all know smoking is not good for health and it can damaged our life but even after knowing all this people are consuming it on the regularly basis. Allowing smoking in restaurants negatively affects the atmosphere by making the air unpleasant, reducing the comfort etc. Many youngsters are consuming it to look cool and to impress the next person and many old age people become habitual about smoking. Smoking contributes to environmental pollution and unpleasant atmosphere in restaurants specially to child, pregnant women, old age person, and a person with asthma disease. Smoking poses serious health risks like respiratory problem, lungs problem, heart disease etc.   Many country have already started to banned smoking but then also every restaurants are not banning it to earn the money without knowing it can take the person life. Actually it's not only the mistake of restaurants but also a mistake of people who are consuming it, a government which are not making a strict rule about banning a smoking in public places. 
So, in my opinion Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants and all the public places in the country.
