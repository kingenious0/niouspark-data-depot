"In my opinion, being independent is itself a great achievement as it helps the person to become successful in everything he does because he never have to be dependent on any one for fulfillment of his requirements. He has got his power of freedom. Therefore, it is important for college students to have a part â€“time job which makes them confident, smart, hardworking, loyal towards his duty, also know the responsibility towards his family.
	In the context of Nepal, many college students are jobless. Being a poor country, there is lack of resources as well as the political instability also hampers the life of teenagers directly or indirectly. Instead of finding job in their on country, they are trying to apply to other developed countries. Therefore, to stop this trend, there should be given more chances to the students specially youngsters to their desired sector of interest which not only helps students but also helps to make the nation strong as youngsters are the pillars of the nation. 
	The students who are doing part-time job can earn money which may also be helpful for them to pay their tuition fees, college fees and their own personal expenses. They can also help their family members to run the household expenses. Having part-time job also keeps them busy which prevents them from involving in bad habits like smoking, drinking etc.
	To sum up, part-time job also makes the student mindset that to do something, there is no need to go to foreign countries. One can do much better if he has passion and patriotic feeling towards the nation.
