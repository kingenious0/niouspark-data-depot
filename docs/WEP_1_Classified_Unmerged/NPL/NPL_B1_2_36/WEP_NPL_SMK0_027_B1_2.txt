"Smoking is harmful as we all know. In my point of view smoking must be banned at the restaurant in my country. Because people who smoke is not killing himself rather he is killing the another who is sitting nearby but not smoking.
As the time is going people do smoking due to friends influence, to get relief from various problems and tension the one is getting at the recent time for short time. Restaurant is the place where people enjoy food. Restaurant environment must be with pleasant dinning environment, must be protecting people's health. This must be completely banned in restaurants because if we do so then we can save the life of many individual who suffer from secondhand smoke, like people might suffer from respiratory problem, asthma, cancer etc. Smoking must be prohibited or banned in the restaurant to maintain the good dining environment in the restaurant and enjoy the environment and food. If we ban smoking in restaurants people can save the money and become financially stable which benefits their life. Doing this can help in controlling the pollution in the nation and maintain the natural beauty. Government must take serious action against it.
So, banning the smoking will help in developing various positive benefits which will benefit people like safeguard people's health, increasing the dinning experience and many more."
