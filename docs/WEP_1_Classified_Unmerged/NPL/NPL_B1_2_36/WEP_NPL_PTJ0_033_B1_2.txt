"yes I agree with this statement because college students need a large amount of money for their personal use and college fees so they need to do a part time job. Students want to depend upon themselves more than their family because university students are high level students so they think for small things they have to ask for money from their parents so it will be hard for a grown up person to ask for money from their parents. Nowadays students want to depend upon themselves that's why?They work as a part timer to earn money for their needs.Part time working is allowed in many countries so many of the students get part time job easily. For a student it is very hard to study in a high level university so they do a part time job for their betterment.Students have so much to do in the other hand they can manage both part time job plus their study so yes I can say that for the betterment and for the growth of development of the country students should do a part time job while studying because it can make student ""how to lead or guide things"". for example one of my neighbors son is in Kathmandu for his further studies so he managed both study and part time work. There is a saying ""if there is a will then there will be a way"".  so it depends on this lines work hard to get success either by working and studying or other things
