"Yes I totally agreed with this statement because smoking can kill many lives so if we banned this then nobody can kill by this. Those
who smoke knows everything but for the enjoyment of little time they smoke. If we go anywhere in the country like a restaurant
or some places then there will be a board by saying ""No Smoking"". Smoking is not a good thing to smoke around everywhere 
because it can affect people  and also  there should be strict actions in no smoking. And especially in the restaurants 
 smoking should be banned because people come to the restaurants to relax and to eat foods and drinks so it can. affect people who
came to the restaurants. Smoking can cause many dangerous diseases like lung cancer smoking directly affect lungs and kidney because of the unwanted smoke inhaled by the person. for example One of my friends father he used to smoke daily but he didn't 
notice about the bad side of smoking and kept smoking daily and suddenly one-day he started to cough by this his family members take him to the hospital and after the checkup doctor told them about his health he has been affected by lung cancer which is most 
dangerous diseases because it can affect people's lives as well as family's life also so people should think about themselves and also for family."
