"I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking is very harmful for health, not only for the person who smokes but also for others around them. When someone smokes in a restaurant, other people also breathe in that smoke. This is called passive smoking, and it is dangerous too.

Restaurants are public places. Many families, children, and old people go there to enjoy food and spend time together. They should not be forced to breathe dirty and harmful air because someone is smoking nearby. It makes the air smell bad and can even make people feel sick.
      Smoking causes many diseases like cancer, heart disease and breathing problems. When people smoke in resturants,the smoke spreads in the air. Other people who do not smoke they also breathe in this smoke,this is called secondhand smoke and it is very dangerous . Children and older people who have never smoked,they also make victim of those bad smell.
      
      
   Many country around the world have already banned smoking in public place,including resturants.If our countries government completely banned smoking in restaurants it will show that country care about public health. It will also make our country more attractive place for tourist who prefer a clean and healthy environment .

Some people might say that smokers have rights too. But their right to smoke should not harm the health of others. If they want to smoke, they can do it in private places where others are not affected.

In conclusion, smoking should not be allowed in restaurants. It will help keep the air clean, protect people's health, and make the restaurant a better place for everyone.
