"I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. A part-time job is valuable as it helps students manage money for their studies as well as cover other personal expenses. In my view, if students engage in part-time work, they become economically stronger, which encourages them to be more responsible and capable of managing different aspects of their lives in a proper way.

Having a part-time job also helps students improve their communication skills, maintain a proper timetable, enhance their skills, and gain valuable work experience. In today's world, work experience is often considered as important as academic qualifications. Some people believe that if college students do part-time jobs, their academic performance will suffer. However, that is not always true. Many students with part-time jobs perform well in exams because they learn how to manage their time efficiently.

In the context of Nepal, I have seen many examples of students who work part-time while continuing their education successfully. For instance, in my town, there was a family that was not economically prosperous and had only a small house. The children, after completing their schooling, began working part-time jobs to support their higher studies and sustain the family. Gradually, their financial condition improved.

Therefore, I strongly believe that having a part-time job is beneficial for college students and their families. It helps develop a sense of independence and equips students with useful skills for their future."
