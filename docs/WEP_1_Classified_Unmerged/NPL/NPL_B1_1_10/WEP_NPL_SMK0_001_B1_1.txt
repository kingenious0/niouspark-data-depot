" Yes, I strongly agree with this statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
Everyone knows smoking is injurious to health but after knowing it too, people are consuming it. We can see the people smoking everywhere in the road, bus station and so on. Along with those places, mostly people are also seen smoking in restaurants. All people who smoke or don't smoke goes to restaurants for eating food. The one who smoke there disturb the other people who came there to eat food. Those people who don't smoke may have allergy or many other things from smoker which might be also dangerous for their health too.  But, nowdays all restaurants are seen selling the ciagarettes and also allows people to smokes there too in the restaurants. People going in the restaurant to food also gets irritate with those smoke exhale by the smokers. People are seen smoking as a fun in the current situation. Many youngsters are also seen smoking as a fun too. So, it is necessary to banned the smoking in all the restaurant in the country. 
  In conclusion, I would like to say that smoking is necessary to banned in all the restaurants in the country due to its various negative effects and other many more."
