""Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country."" yes I  agree with this statement .smoking is injourious to health. It is hamful to atmosphere. smoking causes many deases .
Government should completely banned smoking at all restaurants in the country.if smoking is banned at all restaurants it safeguards the life of  the smokers as well as that of the other people around them.studies have shown that second hand smoke kills. Second hand smoke causes sudden infant death syndrome ,respiratory infections and asthma attacks in children.
Restaurants should be suitable place for families to go to.For example : many people with their children visit XXX Restaurant on vacation .No one wants to see their children playing with cigarette butts and breathing in cigarette smoke. It will be very disturbing and annoying. However, those smokers can smoke at their home or other places themselves without affecting the others.

It is true to say that some businesses have many customers who smoke. Places such as restaurants and bars let people smoke while they are having a meal. 
Everyone knows that smoking affects people's health. Cigarette smoke can cause lung cancer and respiratory problems. Undoubtedly, we cannot ban one from smoking if they, themselves, do not care about their own health. However, as most of the restaurants  are air-conditioned, when someone smokes, the smoke will spread through the whole restaurants   via the ventilation system. Second-hand smokers will also have a great chance of getting cancer. This means that anybody who breathes in cigarette smoke is placing his or her lives at risk. Smokers are not only placing their lives at risk but also other customers.
