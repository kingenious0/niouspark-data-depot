"No, I don't agree that smoking should be banned from the every restaurants in the county. Smoking is the habit of addiction of the people. We cant banned completely in the country because It can be dangerous for some people. Some people cant live, they cant focused on their work as well. It is the digital age and people have a lots of challenges, stress and anxiety in their daily life, so they smoke to relieve from the stress. For example, many restaurants have designated smoking zones where smokers can enjoy their cigarettes without disturbing non-smokers. This way, both groups can be comfortable, and restaurant owners do not lose customers who smoke.
 Rather than banning the smoke we can do some awareness program about the bad effect of the smoke. If we banned the smoke from all the restaurant in Nepal people will stop to go to the restaurants. If there are less number of customers most of the restaurants and hotels will shutdown because of the crisis. People go to hotels and restaurants to get some refreshment, hanging out with their friends and family. In this way hotels and restaurants can generate some income. If we banned the smoking in the restaurants people will start to smoke at their own home. People cant stop smoking by banning in the restaurants. So that we can do other things rather than banning in the restaurants.  Therefore, instead of a full ban, the government can implement rules to protect non-smokers while still allowing smokers to have their space."
