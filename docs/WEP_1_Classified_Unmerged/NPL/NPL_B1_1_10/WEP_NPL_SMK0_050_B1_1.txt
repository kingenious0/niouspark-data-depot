"I completely agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country. Smoking in public places, like restaurants, puts everyone's health at risk, not just the smokers. Second-hand smoke can cause serious health problems for non-smokers, especially children and elderly people.
Moreover, the smell of smoke can ruin the dining experience for other customers. People go to restaurants to enjoy good food and relax. Smoking makes the air unpleasant and uncomfortable for many people.
Banning smoking in restaurants also shows respect for public health. Many countries have already introduced such bans and have seen positive results.Restaurants remain popular, and people enjoy their meals in a clean, smoke-free environment.A old man with his old folded clothes is tired who wants to re-energinet himself with a cup of tea with a smoke.
A lady who is feminist and want to show her activist image, she compromises herself she can’t smoke in open and now in a small cabin of restaurant she explore her as feminist activist.
Me in a restaurant smoking and writing this feeling Deeping myself in various characters and thinking about  the rate of cigarette “ it is damaging my pocket budgets” As we know that one smoke can harm ten people of soerrounding so a smoker harms the health of the customers sorrunding there so smoking must be banned in all the resturants of my country."
