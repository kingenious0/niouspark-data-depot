"I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants in the country.  Smoking is harmful not only to the person who smokes but also to those who are around them. For this reason smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants across the country like Nepal. 
First, smoking in restaurants creates an unhealthy environment in restaurants as many people go there to enjoy food and relax, but smoking ruins the normal people experience and life too. The smoke can also get mix with food, affecting its taste and quality. Smoking also harms children, pregnant women, and people with severe health conditions. As we know that, smoking causes serious diseases, including lung, blood cancer, and heart problems. Banning smoking in restaurants would be beneficial for the non-smokers in the restaurant. Banning smoking in the restaurants can also improve the reputation of the business organization. More customers will visit smoke free restaurants knowing they can enjoy their healthier meals in a pleasant environment.
Hence, smoking in restaurants should not be allowed; it must be restricted as it causes health problems making uncomfortable to nonsmokers and can negatively affect businesses too. A complete ban on smoking in restaurants would benefit both to customers and restaurant owners.
