Yes, I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants across the country. Smoking is extremely harmful to health, as it can cause serious diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and lung problems. It also contributes to breathing difficulties and mental health issues. Cigarettes contain nicotine, which is highly addictive, especially for young people.

Smoking not only harms the smoker's body but can also affect hearing and vision. It often leads young people in the wrong direction, eventually resulting in drug addiction. In restaurants, families with children often dine together. When children witness people smoking and are exposed to the strong smell of cigarettes, it can leave a negative impression on their minds. Since children tend to imitate what they see, watching adults smoke might make them curious to try it themselves, which is dangerous and damaging to their development.

Nowadays, smoking has become very common among the youth. Many young individuals not only smoke cigarettes but also consume alcohol, hookah, and other substances. This behavior gradually leads them into harmful habits and, in many cases, full drug addiction. This negatively affects their health and changes how society views them. Teenagers, too, are increasingly engaging in smoking and drinking. Instead of focusing on their studies, they fall into addiction, damaging their future and leading them down a dark path.

In conclusion, smoking does not just harm physical healthâ€”it also ruins the future of young people by pushing them toward addiction. For the well-being of individuals and society as a whole, smoking should be strictly banned, especially in public places like restaurants.
