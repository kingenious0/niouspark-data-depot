"Yes, I strongly agree with this statements that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
      As, being a college student, their first responsibility is to study hard but along with that I think they also need to have part-time job can help them to practice their theoretical knowledge into practical life. Along with that, they would learn many new things which may needed in the future life. If a college student does a part-time job along with his studies, he/she may be able to be independent. They can pay their fees with the money they received from the part-time job they do. The students can also get various help through the part-time job. Even as in the today's generation practical knowledge is very important. So, the students can be able to get the practical knowledge if they do a part-time job.
        Along with this, there are many students who join the college, but they are unable to pay their fees as being from a poor family. The part-time job may also help those students to earn and pay their fees of the college, which might be like a blessing for them. As an example, I have seen my friend whose family background was poor and was unable to study due to lack of money. But after sometime he started to do a part-time job then he was able to pay fee and joined us in college and also save money for his family. 
               In conclusion, I would like to say that part-time job is seen very essential for the college students in the present time."
