Smoking has become a trend among the younger generation. Many youths believe that if one of their friends smokes, they must also smoke to show off their style and attitude, thinking it makes them appear bold and trendy. As a result, a growing number of young people are suffering from cancer at various stages and facing other serious health problems.

The number of restaurants is increasing day by day, even in small towns and villages. Some restaurant owners promote smoking by offering various types of cigarettes to attract more customers. Their strategy is simple yet harmful — customers come to smoke and end up buying food as well. However, this is an unhealthy and irresponsible approach. It leads to a loss of both health and wealth for the customers. Smoking has become one of the fastest-growing addictions, especially among the youth and the elderly. According to various health research studies, smoking plays a major role in causing mouth and lung cancer. Shockingly, even non-smokers are at high risk due to secondhand smoke exposure, meaning one smoker in a family can negatively impact everyone's health.

Restaurants are places where families — including small children, pregnant women, and the elderly — go to spend quality time together. A smoky environment ruins that experience and silently affects everyone's health. Since restaurants are public spaces, they must remain clean, safe, and healthy. Good food, good service, and a clean environment are the true pillars of the tourism and hospitality industry.

Smoking-related problems are already at their peak. Therefore, it is crucial to eliminate smoking in all public gathering spaces, especially restaurants. A smoke-free restaurant policy would significantly reduce smoking-related issues. So, let's say no to smoking in restaurants and take a step toward building a healthier, smoke-free society and nation."
