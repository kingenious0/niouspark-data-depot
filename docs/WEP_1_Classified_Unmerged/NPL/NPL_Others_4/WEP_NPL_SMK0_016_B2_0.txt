"I strongly support banning smoking in all restaurants. While smoking is a personal choice, restaurants are public spaces where everyone deserves clean air. Here's why this ban matters.
First, smoking harms non-smokers too. When people smoke in restaurants, toxic smoke spreads to nearby tables. Children, elderly people, and other customers are forced to breathe dangerous chemicals.
Second, restaurant workers suffer most. Waiters and chefs spend long shifts inhaling secondhand smoke, risking lung diseases. Many people working at a smoking-allowed restaurant have developed  chronic cough and even more severe diseases. Employees shouldn't sacrifice health for their jobs.
Some argue outdoor areas should allow smoking, but smoke drifts indoors through windows and doors. A complete ban is the only fair solution.
Additionally, smoke-free restaurants are cleaner. Smoking leaves smells and ash stains. After banning smoking, more families would start visiting because the air would be fresher and the tables would be cleaner.
Opponents claim bans hurt business, but evidence proves otherwise. Countries with smoking bans show restaurants remain successful while protecting public health.
In conclusion, banning smoking in restaurants creates healthier spaces for customers and staff. It's a necessary step for public wellbeing that doesn't harm businesses. Everyone deserves to dine without health risks. "
