"I believe it's very important for college students to have a part-time job. Even though study takes a lot of time, working a few hours every week can actually be really helpful. Let me explain why.
The First and foremost reason is Money. Many students would not want to continue begging our parents for money. Having a part-time job can cover your expenses. When you have your own money, you learn how to save and spend it wisely. This would make you a more responsible individual and independent person.
Second, a part-time job helps you learn things you don't learn in school. For instance, if you are working in a shop, you learn to deal with clients or how to correct things if something goes wrong. These are skills that will be useful for any job afterward. I do know few friends who are working part-time in stores, and now I can see that they're much more confident in resolving technical issues and suggesting solutions to the customers. Confidence like this cannot be attained simply by studying. Another Advantage is networking. Working enables you to meet different individuals who can give you tips or even recommend you for other jobs in the future. This is how most graduates obtain better opportunities.
Of course, you do need to balance work and studies. If you work 10–15 hours a week, you become more efficient with your time. You complete homework faster instead of messing around, so you become more focused.
Some argue, Jobs distract students, but I disagree. Working will hold you accountable, make you more confident, and make you a better person. In the long run, a part-time job is not about money—it's about preparing for the real world."
