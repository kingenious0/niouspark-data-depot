"I totally agree that college students ton have a part time job as there are many reasons.
First of all as the students who are from the weak economy background they should engage in work to support their family .Nowadays due to this reason students should engage in job as   a part time In the context of Nepal as well as in foreign country.
Secondly, As  the students who have free time after their class they get bored so they should use their  free time in job.
Third, students who need skill in any field regarding the job of the type it will help them to earn money as well as they can get skill regarding the job they do as getting skill will help them to get more ideas, knowledge ,experience in that field as it also helps them to get good post in job in the near future.
Fourth , part time job helps students to contribute for their college expenses by which they should not depend upon their parents.
So this are my strong points that are expressed in this essay about students who should do part time job apart from study.  Part time job, not only makes the person confident in own professional field but also makes skillfull and creative. Some of my friends have engaged in part time job during their college period and doing excellent in study and job both. "
