"Nowadays smoking is a major issue in all parts of the world where it is in public places or in restaurants, which leads to different problems so according to this above statement, I completely agree that smoking should be totally banned in restaurants, and I will provide my reasons why
As smoking has several effects on the physical, social and environment which are rising day by day as many smokers who have regular visits in restaurants creates this problem. Smoking creates air pollution as it contains harmful chemicals. The habit of smoking leads the person to be regular chain smokers by which they have several effects in health, economy etc. People who are non-smokers are badly affected by the active smokers in the restaurants as non-smokers get highly affected compared to active smokers.
Smoking also effects the teens as they try to copy the smokers as a trend of fashion ,showoff etc. .smoking also creates health issues like asthma ,TB.A regular smoker cannot have a better economy as the income gets depleted by the regular expense for buying cigarettes .Not only in Nepal but all others countries are facing the same problem as western countries have more trend of smoking that is copied by Nepal also.
As the rate of smokers is high in restaurants there will be enough smoke which leads to suffocation for people resulting in environmental pollution and health issues. Smoking also leads to disturbing social relationships as smokers are not liked by most people who don't smoke. 
So according to these reasons I completely agree that smoking should be banned permanently in all restaurants  "
