"I believe that it is a good idea for students to work part time to ensure better opportunities in the future. Those students who are engaged in part time job can lead better prospects in their career. Part-time jobs make students much more financially independent. The benefits of part-time jobs extend to discovering Ownself, own passions, and what we want to do in life. Working part-time gives the freedom and independence to explore students interests and helps them to become more responsible. With the help of the money earned in the jobs, many students are able to afford the fees required in university. By taking a part-time job a student can gain access to new experience and new friends.
 Although working while studying in a university may influence the students' academic performance. The students may not have enough time left to do the assignments. Sometime and he/ she may feel tired after the job and have no energy left to study. However, this is a challenge that the students have to face. They have to learn to balance working with studying and form a new living habit. In order to keep up in both their study and work they have to be more self-motivated. And once the students achieve this, they also gain a sense of accomplishment.
In conclusion, a part-time job benefits a university student in many ways in that it allows a student to be more independent, ethical, responsible, experienced and confident.
