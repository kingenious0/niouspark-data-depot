I 100-percent agree that college students who have time available should have a part-time job. Students who have a part-time job should be more financially independent. They do not have to ask anyone for money, instead they will have to work for it, which can be beneficial for them too. Acknowledging that money does not come easily is a valuable lesson, especially for young people. They will learn to manage their expenses, and save for their future. Moreover, many companies and workplaces require the applicants to have some experience before they decide to hire them. Therefore, having a part-time job before graduation can improve their resume. Furthermore, students can learn how to use the knowledge they gained in class in the working world, sharpening their skills and experience on the way before graduation. College students who work a part-time job will be more efficient and experienced in the real work field. In conclusion, having a part-time job not only help students financially but can help them gain the experience and prepare them for the job market after college.
