 For myself, I think that part-time work for students is not right or wrong , we can't decide whether we should agree or disagree. It has different advantages and disadvantages at the same time , There are many advantages, such as being able to take responsibility for yourself, making money to reduce the burden of family expenses, and this is a new experience that is not taught in school , And if we have worked in a restaurant or a place that uses English to communicate with customers, it will make us a person who dares to express himself in the use of the language and practice the correct pronunciation like a real native speaker , The idea that came back is that when we work to exchange money, we will know the value of time, money and know the value of ourselves more, especially it will make those of us who may have used to spend money playing for fun, will not do that anymore and this is the advantage of working part-time .There are many disadvantages of workig in a part time job : such  they don't have enought time to spend with family , friend, somtime they don't go to festivals , They don't have personal time and maybe they don't rest enough, it might be There is tension and stress from work, hard work every day can make you tired. Don't want to go to school, don't care about lessons, this will lead to poor academic results, this is a disadvantage . 
If we don't work part time, maybe we can use that time to study and develop ourselves better.
