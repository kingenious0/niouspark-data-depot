 I agree with smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant in the country. The male population in our country all mostly addictive to smoking, Maybe 80% of male population. So, when we go to restaurant actually we will see them smoking. Because most men value smoking as a guarantee of maturity and cigarettes contain substances relax, and in the past, cigarettes were used as a sedative to prevent distraction but because the smoker cannot control the amount of smoke they themselves makes, they will becomes adducted to smoking. It is true that they will smoking or not is them problems but we all knew that smoking is not only giving bad effects to the smoker, but people around their who absorb there smoke into their lung might get that bad effect too especially kids and pregnant woman. And when I went to restaurant I have seen many man smoking and the smell so annoying me and maybe another one will have same feeling with me too. If the restaurant have completely banned the smoking these will guarantee the safety for other customers and it's not go against their human right. They still can smoke at the right place where it's doesn't affect or harm other people health.
