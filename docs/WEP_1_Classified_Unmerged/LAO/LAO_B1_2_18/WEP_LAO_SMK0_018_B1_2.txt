"I don't think that smoking should be allowed in restaurants. As we know, smoking is bad for our health and even worse for second-hand smoke. Smoking can destroy the whole atmosphere in restaurants. It can disturb other customers by its smell and smoke. 

A restaurant is a place where we go to enjoy the food, the music, the atmosphere. It's a public place that is full of people, not a private place. Not everyone likes smoking. It can bother other people who come to eat and enjoy themselves in restaurants. It can harm other people's health. Smoke from smoking is not just smoke, it can kill secondhand smoke indirectly. It's even worse when it comes to children, the elderly, and people who have health problems in restaurants. Imagine, if we go to a restaurant to enjoy a meal but then the smoke just bothers me, it might kill my whole day.  

Smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. Not everyone likes to smoke. It harms other people's rights, harms other people's health. The restaurant is a public place, and we have to respect other people who are in the same place. It doesn't mean that we cannot smoke, but we have to think carefully when it comes to coexistence terms.
