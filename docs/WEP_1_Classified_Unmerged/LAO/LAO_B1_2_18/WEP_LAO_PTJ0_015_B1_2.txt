 I agree with this idea. When students go to university it's very talented in them life, because when they come in university they will have many things to do just not study and have many activities it's waiting for them. But it's not means that they cannot do a part time job, I am a university student too and I have do a part time job at the same time, when you have to do a part time job it's can helps you to grow up very much. You can try what an easy work you can try what a hard work but when you do it you will know how to spent the time to have benefits just not wasted your time in your life. If you do a part time job you will have money and this is a big reason that why we should do a part time job during we're study. When you have money you can spend your money and you can reduce the expenses in your family too. when you come to do a part time job you will find new friends new partner and have known many people and make friends with them to make a contact because they can help you in the future. Especially you can improve yourself improve your skills improve you knowledge improve your communication improve your foreign languages it's can improve a many things that you want to improve it.
