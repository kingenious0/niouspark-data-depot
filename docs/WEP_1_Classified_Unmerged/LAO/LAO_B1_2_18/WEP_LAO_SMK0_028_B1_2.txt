" In my view smoking should be banned at all  restaurants in the country because smoking doesn't  affect to smoker but it also affect to physical and mental heath of second hand smoke in restaurant.  When smokers smoke in restaurant, this behavior will annoy non smoker and contaminated others' food because smoke will travel around the air. Consequently, second hand smoke who inhale the smoke have risk to get lung cancer.And over 10 years, both of many  smokers and second hand smoke have  died because disadvantage of smoking. For their mental heath, children who cannot differentiate what is wrong or right will get this behavior  to be  examples because they think it will be cool or they will think if they do like this will mark them to be adults. As a result, the number of teenagers who smoke is increasing every years.So, smoker should consider which  place that they can smoke. For instance,Restaurants should not allow the smokers smoke inside but they should have section for smoker who will smoke. Smokers should follow this rule and care others and their heath. 
I believe that this point should be changed to reduce people who get affected. "
