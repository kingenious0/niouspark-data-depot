"As you know, smoking is known in the world for along time ago, and we will see many people smoke everywhere. In this case, I agree to banned smoking in all restaurants.Because smoking in the restaurant it will make air pollution worse, value of the restaurant is low down and non-smokers feel uncomfortable in the restaurant.

Firstly, smoking is very harmful because it makes air pollution and many people get smoked by smoking. It is one of the main reasons behind the increasing number of lung cancer cases globally. And the restaurant is place where smokers after come, which smoker come to eat food and then they also smoke cigarettes too. 

Secondly, having smoking in the restaurant it will make the value of the restaurant drop down due to if  that restaurant has many smokers, it will make non-smokers do not go there. 

Finally, the non-smokers feel uncomfortable in the restaurant filled with cigarette smoke. It causes them stress. It is also very annoying, particularly for pregnant women and senior citizens who come to take dinner or lunch at the restaurant. 

Conclusion, Everyone has the right to breathe in clean air when they diner or lunch at a restaurant. To  make sure that all diners or lunches can enjoy a smoke-free meal, smoking must be banned from all restaurants."
