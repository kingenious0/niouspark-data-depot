 Actually, I agree about  it is important for college students to have a part time job  because it is a job that can choose to work according to the student's time and is considered to create a good work experience. Especially students who have no work experience. And also make extra income for yourself, help reduce family expenses, do not have to bother with money from home because you can earn money by yourself when having a job, finding new experiences that are not taught in the classroom for yourself. It made the most of your free time. University life would know only university colleagues or professors, but having to go to work part time will make Meet new societies and have a wider connection in the future.
Working part time will help you to be more responsible and manage your time better. Because you have to work while studying at the same time. A part time job can accept other job as well, having a part time work experience is very helpful when it's time to graduate and to actually apply for a job. because experience will gives an advantage over people who have never worked in other jobs before and what can definitely be applied to real work is experience in working society.
