 As most of people around the world knew that smoking is not permitted in the restaurants in addition smoking is the most dangerous thing for our health, society and children.
In my opinion smoking is the most harmful thing for health. For example all of people whose smoking has caused a lungs problem (lung cancer), stroke, heart disease…. which mean that many people all over the world have died from those diseases. Smoking in restaurants is very rude in some countries too because while people eating their food they're breathing in the smoke from cigarettes this may harm their health too. Imagine if you are smoking near children who can have diseases easily because they don't have protection yet they might get lungs or heart disease when they grow old in future. When some people get older their lungs turned into black some are lucky that might have lungs to change but some not. I may understand that smoking it's reduced stress but you should smoke where it suitable, respect other people and don't affect other people in public places. 
Smoking or cigarettes is the most crucial thing that we have to focus on in this generation
