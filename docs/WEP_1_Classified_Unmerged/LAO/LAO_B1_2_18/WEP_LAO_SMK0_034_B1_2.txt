"I agree, because smoking only brings harm more than good to us, and there is zero benefits of allowing smokers to smoke at restaurants.

Restaurants are known to be a public space that serves the people who has the need to eat outside of their home for the convenience of not having to cook by themselves, and most people that are using the service of those restaurants are going to expect it to be harmless, since it's a shared space, and not all people are a smoker.

If smoking are allowed at a restaurant it will only bring harm to those who dont, and lower their life expectancy by having contact with the harmful fumes from the smokers, and there is a solution that can be benificial for both sides which is creating a specific area where smoking is allowed, while also putting down a clear sign to inform everyone, so every smokers can see that they have their own space, while the non smokers can see the sign firsthand, so they can be cautious to avoid the contact of fumes.
