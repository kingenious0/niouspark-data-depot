"I agree, because i there is only good benefits to having a part time job and i can think of 2 good reasons for college students to have a part time job, which is financial, and experience.

I believe that there may be some college students who may be facing financial difficulties, and by having a part time job it will help them to be able to manage, and be able to pay for basic necessities for their everyday lives, as it is an unavoidable part to those who are struggling, and without a part time job it will only be more difficult for them to find opportunities in their lives, so having a part time job is the perfect solution for this type of students.

Not only having a part time job will help 
Those who struggle financially, even those who do not struggle will also gain working experiences by facing the challenges that may come when working in the field, and that will help them to improve their work handling skills, and by the time they're a graduated student possibly looking to apply for a full time job they would be an experienced and well suited applicant.
