   I agree, because education alone can't help us to know much, so I think universities should have part-time jobs for students to have so that students can get a job and earn a salary without asking parents for money too, plus gaining a lot of knowledge from outside and various things related to the field we study as well and also gives us an extra income that helps share family expenses or spend without disturbing money at home and  Working part-time is very useful when it's time to graduate and can be used in work because the work experience gives us an advantage over other fresh graduates and learn essential work skills that are not available in the classroom  and it also makes us more responsible. Because we have to work and study at the same time, which will help us cope with the increasing workload in the future and also allow us to meet more people. Which may be useful to us when looking for a job, may be a job advisor or teach various jobs, so I think we should use our free time to listen to music, watch various movies to find part-time work. To earn extra income and learn new things from new people and also help us develop communication skills and also allows us to save money from our own labor. It also helps us know how to manage study time and work part-time as well. this is my opinion, thank you teacher。
