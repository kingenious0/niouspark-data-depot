 I agree.I think that the restaurants are public spaces where people gather to eat and socialize, and they should be safe and healthy environments,so a smoking ban in restaurants could be seen as a logical step towards promoting public health.Some restaurant owners may worry that a smoking ban could negatively impact their business as smokers may choose to eat elsewhere.on the contrary  Smoking is a personal choice and some people feel they have the right to smoke in public.Many countries have already implemented smoking bans in restaurants and other public spaces such as in the United States, for example, many states have laws prohibiting smoking in restaurants and bars. In Thailand, the law prohibits smoking in restaurants since 2019 too.Not smoking in restaurants can be a good thing and could lead to a healthier and safer environment for everyone. Restaurant owners were able to adapt to the new regulations by setting up smoking areas outside the restaurant.This allows smokers to enjoy their food while reducing the risk of tobacco smoke for others. In summary, banning smoking in restaurants is a good step to promote public health.Because each year there are many patients from the toxic effects of smoking and tobacco smoke.Therefore, in order to reduce the rate of death and lung disease, we should carefully consider the advantages and disadvantages of smoking.
