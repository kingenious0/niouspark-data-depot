 I do agree for smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant in the country. Smoking in restaurant be bannedມ Smoking has always been a big tradition among adults. As time passes it is becoming a object that teenagers use for social stability. It is not popular to the teenagers to smoke alone. They need the gratification of other people seeing them smoke. This factor leads them to smoke in public places. They take in consideration how it will affect the other people in their area. I disagree strongly with people smoking in public places. One of many reasons I disagree with public smoking is the health of the people around the smoker. People will light a cigarette anywhere not thinking about how it could affect individuals around the smoker. Many people have very strong allergies toward cigarette smoke. Second hand smoke impacts some peoples health severely. There are cases where a person had difficulty breathing due to someone smoking in a restaurant where the victim was eating. The odor left behind from a smoker is a smell that cannot be changed. The smoke leaves a sticky residue that is nasty. Letting people smoke in restaurants actually downgrades the class of a restaurant. Ashes are another contributing factor that makes smoking in a public place wrong.
