In my personal opinion I agree about  smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country  because it will cause people inside the restaurant to get cigarette smoke into the body and it will destroy almost every part of the body Starting from blood vessels, brain, gastrointestinal tract, heart until it causes various serious diseases. And it is considered disrespectful to people in the restaurant as well. I think smoking in restaurants should be banned. Or a place where there are many people or should be smoking outside a restaurant. The restaurant must display a sign.  No smoking  or  Smoking is prohibited in this area  and must be posted in a clearly visible place. The advantage of not smoking in a restaurant is that other customers don't have to be annoyed by the smell of cigarette smoke and Family customers can feel at ease that they will not be exposed to the toxic effects of cigarette smoke And It also promotes the value of non-smoking in society, especially with young people. They will be educated to understand correctly that smoking is harmful to the health of smokers and those who are exposed to tobacco smoke And whatever all of things I said it is just my opinion.
