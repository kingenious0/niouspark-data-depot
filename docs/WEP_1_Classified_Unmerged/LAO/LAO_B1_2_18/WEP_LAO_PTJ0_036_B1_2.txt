"In my opinion, I agree with this statement about Why college students should have a part time job during their studies. There are many lessons but I will give you three of them such as reducing family's expenses, getting more experience and time management skills. 

Firstly, reducing family's expenses, many college students have to spend money for their education and things they need. So that will make their parents have to spend more money, some students who came from normal or poor families. They need to get part-time jobs to pay their own bills without help from their parents.

Secondly, joining in part-time jobs enables the students to gain experience in their field of work that promotes their resumes. This is important when it comes to job hunting after completion of studies. Moreover, students that have undertaken part-time jobs and gained relevant experience have the over hand when it comes to getting jobs, unlike those that are just graduates from college. Working part-time for recognized organizations increases one's chances of becoming a better job.

Finally, Having a part-time job helps students to acquire time management skills in the sense that they treasure every time they get and use it efficiently. This happens because their study time is now busy with the job, so they have to remake their schedule to fit in the study time, work time, leisure time and many more. 

Conclusion, having part-time jobs for college students is very important because it helps them to reduce their family's expenses, they have to pay for everything on their own. And they will get more chances to get jobs easily by their experience than other students who do not have experience. And they can manage time for their schedule like their study or work time.
