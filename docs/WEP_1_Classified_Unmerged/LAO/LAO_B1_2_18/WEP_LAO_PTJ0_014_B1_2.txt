 For me, I think working alongside studying is good because we get to experience and know what we like and what we don't like so that in the future we can know what works for us and if we know what we like faster from the increased work experience, it will give us a clearer future goal and having additional work will increase and reduce expenses And now most of our Lao students have side jobs along with their studies, which is very good because the side jobs will help us to practice our own language, be it English or Chinese, to train ourselves to speak that language. Because after graduation, whoever learns English or Chinese, this is a chance to have a job in the future. Because now speaking English or Chinese is very important. Office workers need these languages. And there may be some disadvantages such as insufficient rest. No time for family or friends because after school will have more time to work Therefore, part-time work is not a problem. The opportunity to have less rest and some people who do not do part-time work will have time for family or friends, so those who do part-time work will have the opportunity to overcome obstacles at the same time.
