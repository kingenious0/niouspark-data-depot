"It is often heard that working a part-time job alongside studying is important for college students while some people believe that it causes inefficient results in school. From my perspective, I agree with the opinion that it is an important option for college students these days and think that it gives them more than just money.
	First of all, I believe that money is the main factor in affording a higher education nowadays which is why we are familiar with college students, especially those who are facing financial problems, heading to work after or before their classes which seems to be so hurry and exhausted. Nevertheless, there are several types of part-time job for students to choose, so they tend to work for something that is related to their field of study which means that they aim to gain more professional experience while earning some pocket money at the same time. For example, the students from the faculty of communication art often work as part-time freelance artists. Moreover, a part-time job is quite flexible and normally takes about 5 hours a day. Some places even require them to work only 3-4 days a week. Even though students who have part-time jobs need to work harder to maintain their grades at college, if they are able to manage their time, they will definitely graduate as successfully as others.
	To wrap it up, I strongly believe that a part-time job is important for college students because it could provide the opportunity to improve many aspects of real working experiences and also help them make a better living out of it."
