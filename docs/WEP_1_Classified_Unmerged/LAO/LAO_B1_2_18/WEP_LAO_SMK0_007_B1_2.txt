    For myself, there is an opinion that we should not banned cigarettes everywhere, just use them properly  because they are still useful, but there may be more disadvantages, but Its advantages are: For patients with high blood pressure, it is necessary to use tobacco as an aid to stabilize blood pressure, help control obesity...
Its consequences are also many:There are many places where smoking is prohibited, such as schools, hospitals, bathrooms, parks, petrol stations, restaurants and other places because the smoke of cigarettes causes air pollution to the people around them, such as children, mothers and the elderly or other people with low immunity. Inhaling it will cause diseases to both the smoker and those who receive the smoke from tobacco, such as: blood vessels, brain, heart, lungs and respiratory system.Diseases related to bones and muscles, diseases of the digestive system, for mothers who inhale smoke may be at risk of premature birth or miscarriage, and finally, tobacco is the cause of cancer.
When we know that it has many negative effects that are harmful to both the smoker and the people around us, but we can't stop it from happening.  Therefore, we should avoid such things as: advising people to smoke in places that are prohibited, while we should stay away from areas where there is smoke, it will be safe.
