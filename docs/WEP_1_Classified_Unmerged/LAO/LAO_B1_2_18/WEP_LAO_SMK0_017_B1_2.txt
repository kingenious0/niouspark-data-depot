"There is a discussion among people in society about smoking that should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. In my opinion, I disagree with this idea and find that it is not an accurate solution which is just like telling people to stop smoking all of a sudden.
	In our daily lives, it is normal to see people smoke anywhere even though we know that it causes illnesses. There are some places where smoking is prohibited but unfortunately, people cannot quit smoking that easily and it's not that controllable sometimes, so there are some common rules to do it in public. In addition, there are so many signages that portray cigarette smoke is bad for smokers' and smellers' health. Thus, I believe that we are all aware of manners toward smoking nowadays. As we know, many restaurants already provide a smoking area that is clearly departed from others. Even though smoking is banned at the restaurants, there is still the possibility that people tend to smoke outside where others would walk by anyway. For this reason, it's applicable to set up an obvious smoking area to warn people who are sensitive to it.
In conclusion, I disagree with this because whether smoking is banned at every restaurant or not, it doesn't directly help people avoid the smoke but opposite.
