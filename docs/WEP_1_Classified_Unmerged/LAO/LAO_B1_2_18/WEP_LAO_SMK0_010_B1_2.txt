 I agree because smoking is bad for the smoker and the people around him. But I've been watching the news and reading articles about smoking can help smokers relieve stress. But even so, smoking is still dangerous. If you smoke or sniff too much, May cause lung cancer and Diseases that can cause death. in my opinion, cigarettes should be banned because cigarettes are classified as a type of addictive drug. Therefore, we must help each other to take care of it. Or if they can't There should be an area for people who want to smoke At the same time the governments and related agencies should be very strict on importing and distributing cigarettes to prevent the dangers that may arise from smoking and inhaling excessive smoke for those non-smokers and those with weak health. and from what I saw in high school.  There are still some children smoking in the school shops which is very disturbing to others. Therefore I agree with the ban on smoking because it is harmful to health. The government must have much tighter controls than this so that children under the age of 18 cannot be accessed because it may cause a drop in academic performance and health, The risk of children becoming addicted.
