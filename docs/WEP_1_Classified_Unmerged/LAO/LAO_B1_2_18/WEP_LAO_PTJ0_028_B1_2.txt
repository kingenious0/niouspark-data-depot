 I believe that it is important for college students to have part time job because it will be the benefit to help them to be a good adults. This way can help students to be more confident and have more abilities. College students can earn extra money by themselves, so they will learn how to manage their money and they can help their parents to pay colleges expense because study in college is not cheap. In addition, they will learn how to work, communicate and listen others people such as their colleagues. They can manage their time and they will be people who well-organzine . What is more they can soft problem in real life as well when they have a problem.  They will learn anythings in real life, just not only learn in the school. On top of that, they will gain experiences that is very important to them because after they graduate, it is easier to get a job than people who don't have experiences. All things should be considered by college students in society.They should choose what way that will be benefit  and progress themselves.
