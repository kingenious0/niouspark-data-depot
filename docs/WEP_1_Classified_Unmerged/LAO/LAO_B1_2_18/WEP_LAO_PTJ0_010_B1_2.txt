 I agree.   Personally, I've never worked part-time, but I've seen and learned from close friends who work part-time, and I think Since students work part-time,  It will help them gain work experience over new graduates, more mature  Because I have to deal with different types of customers, earning income do not ask parents, reduce family and university expenses Because for students from other districts then There is a high cost of studying, knowing the value of money, not spending extravagantly, and being more responsible Because they have to study while working, Finding your preferences and learn the skills needed to do the job, which not learned from the classroom because in the classroom teaches us with does theory not teach practical But for the 4th year, the university will allow students to do internships for experience because These skills are necessary for the working society Because most companies require people who have more experience working in that field and have a wide connection because in the future those people will be useful for finding information for graduation projects or they may help recommend jobs  . But studying and working part-time at the same time adds to the burden on students as well as students may not have enough free time to rest, no time to take care of themselves which affects their studies and health.
