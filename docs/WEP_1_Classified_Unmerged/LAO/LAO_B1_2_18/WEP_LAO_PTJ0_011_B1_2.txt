 In my opinion, it is important for college students to have a part-time job because do part time job will creat them to become more experienced in their future careers, especially if the part-time job is connected to their major. They can learn a lot of new skills, such as communication skills, time management skills, and the value of money, so they can manage their finance properly. Get a lot of experience that they cannot learn in the classroom and also learn about teamwork skills and how to deal with co-workers and customers. They also have income while studying, which may not be that much money, but it can decrease the financial burden for some students. It also has the disadvantage that they will pay less attention to lessons if they do not manage their time well, which will affect their grade scores. Some students have part-time jobs that finish until night, but they have class in the morning, which is harmful to their health. Part-time jobs have pros and cons, so if you think that's good for you or you want to pursue something else, part-time jobs are a good choice.
Finally, I encourage college students to have a part-time job. Although they have enough money to pay for or be able to accommodate their necessities, they can practice practical skills before graduating and apply for a full-time job in the future.
