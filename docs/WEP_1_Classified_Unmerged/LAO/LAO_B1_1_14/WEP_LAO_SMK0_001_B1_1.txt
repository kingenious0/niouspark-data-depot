     In my opinion, the smoking has a lot of effect on the body and has no effect at all. For example, nicotine addiction, if we smoke in large quantities or more consecutively, it will have a bad effect and can't stop smoking it. In 1 cigarette, it can destroy almost every part of our body, starting from the lungs. Breathing, blood vessels, brain, heart, skeleton, and muscles For example, it has a long-term negative effect example : It should not be smoked in public places, workplaces, schools, restaurants, hospitals. Must be a non-smoking place because smoking in that place is something that should not be done because it causes trouble to those around you as well Finally, I would like to reduce smoking and stop selling tobacco to teenagers in order to reduce the problem of smoking addiction so that it does not harm themselves and others. I want smoking to become taboo, to become an unlawful thing, so that I can stop smoking and turn to keep my body alive. Just quitting smoking is healthy. Lungs will come back to work better. But quitting smoking will help the body to be more balanced and the quality of life will also improve as well.
