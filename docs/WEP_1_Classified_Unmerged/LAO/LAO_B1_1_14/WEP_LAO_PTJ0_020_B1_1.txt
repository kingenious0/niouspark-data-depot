I think it's a good idea for college students to have a part-time job because they need to spend a lot of money on their college life, and some people don't want to use their parents' money to live extravagantly. I know that a lot of people who study in college or university have part-time jobs because most of them come from another province to study in the capital city, so they have lots of things to pay, such as tuition fees, text books, transportation fees, electricity bills, rent bills, and necessary expenses, and so on. Some of them want to find new experiences with a part-time job to earn new skills like time management, responsibility, or communication skills, which are important not only in the workplace but also in life too. Some of them are from families with less money. In this economy, people need to find a part-time job for their extra income to help their parents to cut down on their expenses and support themselves. Having a part-time job can provide students with the independence to face problems by themselves so that they can improve their problem solving skills and learn how to work as a team.
