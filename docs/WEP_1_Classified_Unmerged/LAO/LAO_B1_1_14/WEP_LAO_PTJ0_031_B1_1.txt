I do agree that college students should have a part-time job. In my opinion, there are many reasons why it benefits college students. The first one is that it gives students to learn how to work with people, so they can develop communication skills and make connections with others. Moreover, having a past-times job taught students to learn how to earn money. While they are working sometimes it will help them to find themselves in that moment. As we can see, many students even graduated from college but they still do not know what they want to do or who they want to be. In the past, some might think that students who have part-time jobs or work while studying are poor but now it shows us that a part-time job gives so many benefits to students of every status. Furthermore, If students want to be hired easier at least they need to have activities or job experience in their curriculum vitae. It will be one of the reasons that will help some students to get their work done. So, I think that having a part-time job will be one of the reasons that will help someone who doesn't know themselves yet and help them to get over it.
