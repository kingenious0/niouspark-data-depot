 From my idea,  I think it is Part-time work is very important for students because now part-time work can be seen that most of the free time will come to work moret for college students to have a part time job: which is making money by yourself and saving money to help my family, learn to gain experience, learn to solve problems by yourself, learn money management skill, Help develop leadership skills, take advantage of your free time, develop language skills for  communicate with native speakers Because language is important for everyone and for job. Disadvantages of working while studying. working together with studying  It will definitely increase the pressure on students because in addition to having to be fully engaged in studying.  Will still have to work hard again  Which, if the summoner decides, should do his best. Students will have less time because most of their free time is spent on work.  Causing some students to not choose to work while studying as they choose to spend most of their free time traveling  or go on vacation
Given that you can learn the basics while working part-time, this seems like a viable choice while also reducing the amount of stress working less which will allow you to appreciate your endeavors without having to drag your work around with you all day.
