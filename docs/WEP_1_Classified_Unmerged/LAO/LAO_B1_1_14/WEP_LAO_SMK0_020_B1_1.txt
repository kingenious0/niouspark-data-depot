In my opinion, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because, no matter where you smoke, it should not disturb others, not even in restaurants but in any public places. A restaurant should be the place for gathering people, like families or friends, and having a meal with enjoyment and satisfaction. In general, we all know that a restaurant is not a place to smoke. At least we can make some noise, but not too loud, at the place, and it is of course forbidden to do anything harmful to the place, but it is still not ok to smoke in the restaurant. When you smoke in any restaurant, it will of course create an unsatisfactory environment in the place, making it uncomfortable for the people there, especially children. If you really want to smoke, the best solution is to smoke outside the restaurant. Therefore, smoking should be seriously banned in not just restaurants but in theaters,  hospitals, schools, etc. It should be common sense for smokers to know where they should smoke or where they should not. Every restaurant should have a sign that states that smoking is forbidden in this restaurant and should have adequate punishment for those who break the rule.
