Pros:working on a website will certainly help us earn money som students whose financial status is never good need to earn money to send themselves to study lu wants to help reduce Family expenses but some teenagers still need to spend money to buy clothes,necessary school supplies part-time work is a good solution.ln addition,part time work also helps us earn extra income learned experience at work,There is more responsibility,learned skills in the workplace that could not be learned from school get to know more people which may be beneficial in your future job search, get a loan with a certain in come every month,met a variety of friends to create a wide society,when they are sick or on leve from work,they will have money to help them.
The consequences are:There is hardly any time to rest create pressure in addition to having to concentrate on studying and also having to concentrate on work,spend less time studying Overtime work will not be paid,the salary is not suitable for the work done,health is not strong be cause of not enough rest,there is hardly any time for homework,No time to hang out with friends.
