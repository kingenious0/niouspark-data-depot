   In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because it is dangerous to everyone's health. It destroys the vibe while eating and makes unpleasant smells in the restaurant. The smell of cigarettes disturbs other people, it's disrespectful to other people and places. Everyone comes to the restaurant to enjoy the vibe and spend time with their family. They probably felt very bad that someone came to spoil the vibe. No matter if people around you do not smoke, but they breathe in it, and they are being affected by you, it is called second-hand smoke. We should be aware that it causes cancer. It doesn't just hurt you, but it hurts other people too. Smoking puts you at risk of bad health. It makes you tired easily, and it is difficult to breathe, because it destroys the respiration system in your lungs. There are a lot of negative effects on health. In conclusion, all the restaurants in the country should solve this problem by banning smoking in restaurants, because it is not good and has only negative effects for everyone. Restaurants are places where we have to be together with other people, we must respect each other and the place.
