 For me i think the restaurant is the place for families and many families have children  or babies to go with so nobody need their baby to smell the smoke of cigarette but we can't deny if anybody need to smoke for relaxing after eating it's might be their pleasure it would be bad for them if it's illegal but smoking in restaurant is disturbing and annoying other people however if they can smoke at their house, their car, their private area or some of restaurant have the area for smoking, they can smoke without affecting other people. Every body know smoking is affect your health in the long term. The smoke from cigarette may cause a lung cancer or respiratory problems. We knew we can't stop the smoker if they don't take care of their health. Anyway most of restaurant are use air condition when someone smoking the smoke will spread over other people that not even the smoker but other people are at high risk of being cancer, it make other people in trouble with health problem. The smoker not just made their life in dangerous but it affect to other people especially with the little child. To ban smoking in the restaurant might didn't affect to the business that much but no doubt most of the customers are not into smoking if there is banning smoking in the restaurant will help peoples'health better and make the restaurant feel much better
