Absolutely yes. I agree with them because working part-time not only earns money but also gives us a lot of work experience that we can't find in school. From my perspective, working a part-time job teaches a lot of things that are important for life after graduating. You will never know the value of money or how difficult it is to find it. If you still ask for money from your parents, working to earn money to pay for your own tuition will reinforce the value of money. Besides that, for students who study in college, working a part-time job is a good way to research ideas to make a report or presentation because lessons from real experience will always be better than lessons from the internet; you can touch it and feel it. Furthermore, every trouble that you face from working part-time will improve your mind, your problem-solving skills, and your critical thinking, which will be your advantages in the future, whether you work or do business. As we can see, most successful people often had a part-time job, doing work while they studied in college or school. Finally, I still believe that having a part-time job while studying at college will give us twice as much knowledge and experience as others.
