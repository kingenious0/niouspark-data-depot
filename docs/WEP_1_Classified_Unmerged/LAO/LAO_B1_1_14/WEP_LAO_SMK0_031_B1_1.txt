"I am extremely agree that Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking in public is illegal and that's why there are designated smoking areas only. As we all know that Drug addiction is a dangerous substance and it is the cause of many deaths. Especially people who are second hand smoking. As we can see there are many cases of second hand smoking and it has created a lot of pain for those affected.
Therefore, banning smoking in restaurants is the most correct thing. Because I am sure that no one in the restaurant will like it if there is someone smoking in the restaurant or in that area because it will definitely make the atmosphere or the feeling of the people in the restaurant feel bad. And the most important thing in a restaurant is a place where everyone can't avoid the passive smoking, if there are people smoking in the restaurant and try to imagine if someone is smoking and others are sitting, eating or talking in the restaurant, of course the passive smoking will spread throughout the restaurant. Imagine how much it would affected to people in the restaurant. These are why smoking in the restaurants should not be allowed. "
