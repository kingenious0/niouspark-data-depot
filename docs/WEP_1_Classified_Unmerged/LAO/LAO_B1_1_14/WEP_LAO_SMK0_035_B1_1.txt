"There is smoking for a long time since the past until now. It has both advantages and disadvantages, but smoking still be favored for some groups of people.

I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It is because some of people who like smoking not smoke only in their place, but they do it in public places too, especially in the restaurants, I think people come to reatuarants to have a meal and during having a meal, they probably do not want the smell of cigarette smoke. Some people who come to restaurants has not only adult, there are some elderly people and kids, so it not safe and good for them. When someone smokes, It produces cigarette smoke which effects people around the smoker. Smoking can make the smoker feel relaxed, but if they use it so often, it might clause some of health problems. The problems of health not only happen with the smokers, but also people around them. Actually, there is a method that can help in solving the problem of smoking in restaurants like providing the specific areas where smoking is allowed and clearly far from the areas used for eating, It is not work for every restaurants, though. There still have some people who do not follow this solution. Maybe it would be better to try another way and strictly banning smoking in restaurants is also a good option.

The last, I see that smoking in restaurants has more negative effects. It does not effect only the smokers but it also effects people around them. And restaurants is the one of places where full with a lot of people, so I think it should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country."
