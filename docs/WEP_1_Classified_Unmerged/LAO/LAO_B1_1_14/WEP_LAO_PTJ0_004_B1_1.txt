 In my opinion i think having part time job is quite important for college students because having part time job can give college students can earn extra income for their selves in daily life by doing part time. They can do after school or can do a full time job on the weekend as well, beside that it's good to let the students have saving money it'll be useful for in the future just like when we graduate we can use the saving money in our own business or use it for traveling to gain new experience and can also find something new on traveling. Then another important reason, doing part time is very helpful for us, we can develop our skill whether service, speaking, listening or other... . we can gain new knowledge and can see and join the new society, know more people. Doing part time can develop our skill so much in this case the English language student like us can develop speaking skill, listening skill, develop knowledge from working in hotel, restaurant or service department and for the economics students they can know about service or marketing. Doing part time can give us a very good experience that we can't get from class as well.
