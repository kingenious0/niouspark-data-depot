In my opinion, I agree with that. It is important for college students to have a part-time job, because the education recently costs a lot of money. So, it is a good idea for college students to have a part-time job to help their family with expense. What if college students have a part-time job, they will gain a lot of benefits not just the money. For instance, experiences, knowledge,skills in many things which are necessary for their life in the future. They will know how to handle the problems if they make the mistakes. Having a part-time job is one of the things that can make them grow up, but it is better to work part time with their own vocational to gain the knowledge and experiences before they completely get full time work.  In the future, if the college students' families don't have money to support their education, they still can work and support themselve because they have a part-time job while they was studying, it might made them tired however. What if they don't want to study anymore because of any reason, they could drop and do it a full time job. I believe that they can handle their life if they are daring enough to step out the comfort zone and try to do a part-time job.
