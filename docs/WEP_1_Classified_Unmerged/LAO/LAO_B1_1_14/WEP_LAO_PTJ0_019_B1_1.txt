"In my opinion I agree with student to have part- time Job, it's very important because It can help students by many ways such as: Financial, Knowledge, a lot of experience, how to manage life. 
    For students to have a part- time job It good  for them to find new something to do and get chance and it can help them learn from what they have to do, without this to have a part-time job have more experience to do and use in reality and know how to survive by themselves , student have a lot of knowledge, know how to accept about reality, real experience and know environment, know how to save more money by themselves, know value of money and what they have to do and that can learn from work, a lot of people in society. Without It's good for them, it also good for their family too such as: reduce expense, get more income.  For having a part time job, mostly will have good result for them, it also helps them to have many ways to choose, choose how to do, decide about what will have to do in the future.
     To summery, I think it's very important for students to have a part time job because it can help them by many ways and have a lot good result for themselves such as : learning from real experience, manage about what they have to do.
