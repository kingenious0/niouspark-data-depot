"I agree with this topic because we all know that smoking is not good for health.and the smell of smoke is also interrupt other customers who are not smoking in restaurants because they want smell the food not the smoke of the cigarette if someone wants to smoke they are supposed to smoke outside the restaurants or there should be have specific places or zone that allow smoking.
I think banning cigarettes in restaurants should be published in TV or social media, this concept should be taught in education system as well.In order for restaurants not to have smoking There should be have punishments in restaurants for who smoking such as if they smoke they have to pay. If they don't pay they need to get out.
People who smoke are not that wrong, but they have to respect the social rules or other people especially old people, children,sick people,and women who are pregnant.
So I support banning smoking in restaurants and it is should be a basis rule that people have to do in every restaurants.
