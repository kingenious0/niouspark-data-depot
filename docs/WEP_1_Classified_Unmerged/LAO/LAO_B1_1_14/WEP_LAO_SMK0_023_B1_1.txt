In my opinion who doesn't like smoking, I really agree with that. Smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country, because restaurants is one of public places where every kind of people can enjoy. For me, smoking is not the polite thing and most of people also don't like it. However I also understand people who like smoking, they smoke because they love it, smoking offers their happiness, it is their choice. I still insist on it, smoking suppose to be banned at all the restaurant to avoid setting bad role model for the children and to respect each other because the cigarettes smell so bad, people come to eat and enjoy the food or the environment in restaurant, they want to have nice and fresh moment. So, it is not acceptable to smoke in the restaurant. Let's think,  if smoking is allowed in every restaurant, what would happen?? The children might see it and think that it is the cool thing to follow, how can we handle it if the children start smoking at the age of 5? It is the bigger problem than smoking in restaurant. For these  reasons, smoking should not be permitted at every kind of public places if it's possible.
