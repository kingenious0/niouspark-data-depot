"Yes, I agree with this matter. A restaurant is a place where people use it for having meals, experiencing good taste, and enjoying the wonderful smell of foods. Smoking in a restaurant is considered something that should not be done because it very much disturbs other people. Not everyone likes smoking. I am one of those people who really doesn't like it when someone smokes in restaurants. In addition to making our appetites less, the smoke from cigarettes is also not good for people's health. People who smoke should be considerate of others because there are both old and young people in restaurants. They should go outside the restaurant to smoke, or just finish having their meal and go out to smoke. I'm pretty sure no one takes a whole day to eat just one meal, so I think about stopping smoking in restaurants. Everyone can do it, and it is good to ban smoking in restaurants. Stopping smoking in a restaurant not only respects other customers but also respects chefs who are dedicated to cooking for us with all their skill. And in addition, when entering a restaurant, everyone should experience the joy of eating, not smoke cigarettes that have a bad smell and are not good for health.
