"Nowadays, it is necessary for college students to have a part-time job because of inflation. For sure doing a part-time job can earn less money which students cannot  spend enough in a days but one thing that is more important than it is experience during doing a part-time job. 
I strongly agree with student must have a part-time job when they are in college or university. The inflation in lao is the biggest problem which cause many people in lao living difficult live especially for lower income family. I think doing a part time job is one way to help their family win the inflation problems
A person who is new graduate who does not have an experience of work will find it difficult to find work. Almost company need a person can work not just graduated from a good university and get the high grades so they must have a hard work skill, communication skill, team work skill that had in a part time job not in school
A part-time job will help a student improve their ability to work. When students work, they will know how to manage time
In conclusion, it is important for a student to have a part-time job. I don't say that part-time job is more important than study in college but they have to do both for getting a better job in the future.
