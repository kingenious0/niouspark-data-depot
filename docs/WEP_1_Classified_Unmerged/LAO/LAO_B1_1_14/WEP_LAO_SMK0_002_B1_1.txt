From my view, I strongly agree that smoking is prohibited in public places or restaurants,Because the smoke from cigarettes affects the smoker and and people who smell cigarette smoke.In addition to diseases caused by smoking There are many more penalties for smoking.  This results in various physical abnormalities such as tooth decay, black stained teeth, bad breath, body odor, yellow nails, rough skin, gray hair and premature aging.  which affects socialization and daily life Until I may have to suffer from depression.  or suffer from a disease that may eventually killAnd we also have ways to prevent cigarette smoke.Smoking must not be allowed in the house or car.  if smoking Wash your hands before touching things in the house.  Avoid places where people smoke.  and not near the smoking area Take extra precautions for children, pregnant women, the elderly, and people with heart or respiratory problems.and personal opinions are Cigarettes should not be produced in the first place because it does more harm than good.The good thing about smoking is that it's almost nonexistent, only bad people.I want to know what he was made for.If it's used as a medicine or medical use, it should be better.produce for people to consume.
