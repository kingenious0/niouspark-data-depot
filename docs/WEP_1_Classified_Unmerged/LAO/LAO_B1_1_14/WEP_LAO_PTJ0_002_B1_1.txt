   I agree that students have a part -time jobs, Because it will save us the expenses that our family has to pay, If we can work part-time, it means that we can find a job to make money for yourself, it should be done. If you want something, you can spend the money you earn without having to ask your parents for money ,And it is also working to create experience In the future, if we graduate , Because the only goal after graduating is to make money or to earn money to study well or family. It will also make us a person with enthusiasm for work. If we know how to plan and use our time correctly, we will become good-hearted. makes us responsible for life planning  ,It also makes us learn new societies, opening up another world. Plus, we also have various incomes from working Part Time and gaining additional knowledge on many things. If we learn to work when we are still learning, we will know the value of money and spend money rationally. Working part-time has more pros than cons.If we know how to split time or use the rest of the time from studying to work part time.The disadvantage of working part time is that we will not get enough sleep, but we can find a job that we can be done and does not affect the study. Because it is the beginning of life where we have to work and earn money to support ourselves
