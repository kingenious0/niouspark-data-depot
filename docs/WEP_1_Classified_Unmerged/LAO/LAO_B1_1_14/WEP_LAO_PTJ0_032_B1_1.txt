"Yes I do. Because I think it is very important for students who are poor, or students who want to rely on themselves and who want to have experience of working. A lot of students need part-time jobs because it is the only way that they can do while studying in University or colleges to reduce their parents's payments. Although having a part-time job effect on their studying maybe it makes them get lower grades, but it is reasonable.
For me I think making money while studying is such a great mindset because it means they gain a lot of experience in this period, they know that how hard is it to get money every penny, and know  how to manage their time as well. 
Some students was born in poor family, that can not support their terms fees. So they have no option they have to work for theirs education, for theirs future. For these students if they couldn't have part-time jobs, they couldn't study. So I very appreciate the students who work hard for their study."
