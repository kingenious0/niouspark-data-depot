"I currently agree that it is essential for college students to have a part-time job. Education in Laos is facing an issue that students do not want to study at university due to theirs budget. Then, some students choose to work rather than study and this affects to the number of students in university has been decreasing. I would support to have a part-time job that can help students to reduce their expense and has enough income. Moreover, a part-time job also improves your social skills, meet new society, learn how to live with others, and get some experiences that you can learn from it. 
I support the idea of part-time jobs for college students, as they can help reduce expenses and provide income. In the other hand, some students who did not manage their time or life can also get affected how to hold the education and a part-time job have balanced and do it well together. In this situation, I have still thought that a part-time job is essential for college students and it should have the organization which can get advises, information, and support about how do a part-time well along with study."
