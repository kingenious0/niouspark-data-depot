I agree Smoking sounds be completely banned at all the restaurant because:disturb the good atmosphere,it caused health issue and bad example.
-Smoking in a restaurant is seen as spoiling the good atmosphere because the smell of cigarettes will disturb others and change the smell and atmosphere of the restaurant And most importantly, others will see that you are rude as well.
-Smoking for a long time will make us lose a lot of health, especially the problem that is often found in the middle-aged or young people is the problem of chronic cough for a long time or in some cases, there are problems with the lungs and more severe, it may even lead to cancer and death.
-Smoking in a restaurant, apart from disturbing others and damaging health, is also an example not to be given to others, especially children who have not yet reached the age of maturity. You will not recognize and listen to what should or should not be done, so they may use this behavior as an example to use in a bad way.

I think banning smoking in restaurants is a good idea."
