I am of the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because it affects to other customers and the restaurants. It makes secondhand smoke. Cigarette smoke is very toxic, it causes of many kinds of diseases, many people know that smoking is harmful to our health and many people who smoke get lung cancer. It still makes people who do not smoke get lung cancer also, because nonsmokers often breathe in the smoke from the other people's cigarettes. For example: If there is a person smoke in the restaurants other people who are the restaurant, will breathe cigarette from that person. Smoking is in the restaurant is very bad environment, when old people smoke in the restaurant, it would make students can see and copy easily, many students and children begin to smoke because they see old people smoke after that they follow. It also lowers the quality of the restaurants. It is one thing that makes other customers upset. Most nonsmoker are annoyed when they breathe cigarette smoke form smokers while they are having food, for this case makes many customers are not impressed and they would not come to the restaurant again. It would be a defect of the restaurants. So, I think for these reason smoking should not be allowed in all restaurants.
