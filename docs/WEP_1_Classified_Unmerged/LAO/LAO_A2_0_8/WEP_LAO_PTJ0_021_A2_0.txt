"     A part-time job is different from a full-time job because a part-time job works fewer hours than a full-time job. Examples of part-time jobs are servers, tutors, delivery drivers, and so on.
     Doing a part-time job is useful for people who want to earn more money and have a little time, especially college students. Moreover, working part-time while studying is beneficial in terms of developing work skills while studying, but at the same time, it also has a negative effect because we have to work hard and know how to manage our time. Through my experience as a waitress at a cafe, at first I was very excited and paid attention to it, and I could gain experience, meet new friends, and make money for myself, but all these things exchanged our tiredness, causing us to not get enough rest because we study while earning money, which affects both study and health as well.
     In addition, doing a part-time job is a good thing that we can learn from, and it can be an experience for us to prepare ourselves for working in the future. Lastly, working a part-time job depends on ourselves and our satisfaction because we are from different backgrounds and environments but don't do part-time job too much, just do what is suitable to us. We have to remember that the most important thing is our study."
