"It is important for college students to have a part-time job. But i disagree that students have to do part - time job because it will make them tired , pressure and worry.
Students will be too much tired.
All students should only focus on their lessons
Many faculty should learn at least 6-8 hours per day(08:-12:00/13:00-15:30) if some of student do part time job they have to spend at least 4-5 hours for work with a little bit of salary i think it not worth it to west the times, they used power to much it might effect to their health
Students may get pressure instead confident
At the period of student, students have many hard time from their lessons, they get serious about their lessons and grade ,i think this is too much for them, if they still got their work  issues that make them be pressured double time they shouldn't deserve it.
Students's worried will effect to their lessons
Students by worried may lost confidence and everything will be worse 
I disagree with students have to do part time job for many reasons.
Students use too much power it might effect to their health, they shouldn't deserve another pressure except lessons pressure. they got worried will effect to their every side , Students of all this period shouldn't deserve any issues over their abilities."
