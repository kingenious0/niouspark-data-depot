"Smoking is bad for health. It destroys health, but it is also a good thing for some people, such as people who have some diseases. You need to smoke but you must have permission from the doctor before you can.
     Some countries make smoking illegal, while others do not. Smoking is not the wrong thing, but you should think about your health. If you smoke too much, it will affect your health, and it can make you die. We don't know that it will be bad at the moment when we smoke; we cannot see it, we just see smoke, but it will affect our health in the long term, and it will into people's bodies near you. Moreover, when smoking in a public we should know the areas where we should smoke and where should not. Some areas, we cannot smoke, such as hospitals, schools, and restaurants. Because of these areas there are many people around there. Especially in the restaurants, we are eating if there is someone smoking. When people breathe or eating, the smoke will be into a mouth and nose. And of course, it will affect our health.
     I agree with that "Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country" because there are many people in the restaurant and smoking can affect all people, causing extensive damage. So we should ban smoking in public areas."
