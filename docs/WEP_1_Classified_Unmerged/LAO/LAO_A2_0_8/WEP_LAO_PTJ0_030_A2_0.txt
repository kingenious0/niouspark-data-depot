In my opinion, it is important for college students to have a part-time job because, it can help they to improve many skills. As we know that college students already have some skills, but it would be better to get experience from part-time job. They can learn many things from working mistakes. These things would make they are more developed. They would be more organizing and good at management time. Part-time job could build their patient, experience, self-confidence and dare to face challenging things in the future. When they have all of those, they could be able to live by themselves, because they are not only receiving experiences, but they still get some income from their part-time job. So, it can help to reduce their expenses. To have part-time job can also help them to have more opportunity. For example: many companies or organizations nowadays need only the people who have a lot of ability, knowledge, and more experiences. If college students do not get a part-time job while they are studying. They would miss various learning soft-skills from working because some skills are not taught in college. So, those are why college students should find to have a part-time job while studying.
