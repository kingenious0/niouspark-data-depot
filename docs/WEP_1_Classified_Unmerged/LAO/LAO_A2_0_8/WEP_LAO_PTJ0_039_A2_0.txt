It is important for college student to have part time job because:experience,salary and opportunity
 Work experience is the most important factor because many companies want people with at least 3 months or 2 years of experience and experience is also important when we write a resume if we want to work with a big company or want to earn more monthly. The resume must be good and have a lot of experience.
 We will have a monthly allowance that will help both the expenses of studying and the expenses of the family and maybe there will be money to travel without spending the family's money without being a burden for the family to use their own money without being a burden to anyone.
 We will have more opportunities than others, whether it is the opportunity to get work experience or the experience to know more about society while others are studying after finishing their studies to look for work, but we don't need to because we already have a job, but if we want to get a regular job that is busy, we have more opportunities than others because we have a lot of work experience and we still know many people who learn more about work and society.

I think it is important to have part time job while studying"
