"Smoking should be completely  banned at all the restaurant in the country. In this case i really agree because Smoking is Cause lung cancer, Environment pollution and harmful.
Smoking is the main factor that causes lung cancer and killed thousands of people in every day around the world ,There are many countries were banned smoke in restaurants  such as New Zealand, Spain and another countries. And make  second smoking feel stress when met someone smoker smoking in restaurant because it make they not enjoyed with to their food 
Smoking is environmen pollution i have known.
It's causing the human and animal to have problems breathing, the air is not pure,Makes the air hot and stuffy, leaving behind PM 0.5 dust.
Smoking is a serious type of harmful.
It harms the person who smokes and attacking the second person who receives it is more than dangerous.A person who smokes will be killing others without realizing it.Especially for women who are pregnant, if get  smoke too much, it will cause she to have a miscarriage or it might cause her child to have abnormalities.
I agree to banned smoking in a restaurant and country for many reasons.
Smoking is made non- smoking feel stress, made Pm 0.5that very harm to people, animals and environments.i believe people will be healthy and be very happy, when can banned Smoking.
