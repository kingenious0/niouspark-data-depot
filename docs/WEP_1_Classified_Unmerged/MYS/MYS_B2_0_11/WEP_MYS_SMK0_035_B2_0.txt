Yes, I agree that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. This is because smoking brings more harm than good. Especially in a restaurant which is a public space and constantly packed with families with young children. Nobody wants to see kids breathing air that is filled with cigarette smoke. On top of that, inhaling second-hand smoke is equal to being the smoker himself. This is because it can lead to various health-related problems. For instance, lung cancer, stroke, heart disease, and chronic bronchitis. The worst part is that it affects those around the smoker. In addition, they set a terrible example for the kids and this can lead them to try smoking as they see it as an encouragement. Hence, smoking should be prohibited as it is the only way to avoid youngsters from smoking at an early age. Next, smoking at a restaurant is just blatantly rude. People pay for their food to have a great taste not to have it tastes like cigarette smoke. Besides that, some people dump their cigarette butts as they please. This is very dangerous as it can cause a fire unintentionally. There have been thousands of cases because of this hence smoking in a public space like an eatery should be taboo. Although banning smoking is not easy but in order to make it work, the first step must be taken. In conclusion, it is clear that smoking should be illegal as it would enhance the health of thousands of people.
