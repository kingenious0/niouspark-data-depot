      For long, it has been common, even customary for college students to work part-time. This is perhaps enforced by societal expectations, or in some other cases, a need to sustain one's finances. Either way, work experience is highly valuable on a resume. Such early ventures into the workforce are crucial to these young college students.
     For starters, workplace experience will give college students a head start in job seeking. A few additional years of work experience, especially in a relevant field, is highly coveted by employers. It would be fair to assume that a person with experience in retail or customer service with a few years of experience is more than capable of handling certain social interactions professionally at work. Thus, any additional workplace experience would be favored by a potential employer.
     Secondly, finding a job as a college student will also teach a person the valuable skill of time management. Juggling college assignments and work commitments is no easy feat and getting into this early will allow one to transition into adulthood with greater ease. This is highly beneficial, and these students will grow into dedicated adults with a work-life balance. Therefore, getting a job in college will help one manage their time more efficiently.
     Lastly, finding a part-time job as a college student will surely help students gain more independence. This includes independence from one's family financially, as well as greater discipline and control over oneself. An employer looks for such qualities in potential employees, and having such virtues benefits both oneself from a more domestic standpoint too. Thus, getting a job in college can make one more independent.
     In conclusion, getting a part-time job in college can be an arduous task, but it is still worth the hassle, as the benefits are overwhelming.
