      Smoking in public spaces is known for causing quite a nuisance to society in general, particularly non-smokers who would prefer the prospect of eating in peace, without the stench of cigarettes hanging in the air. Personally, I would prefer to codify such a rule officially, so that smoking in restaurants would not be a legal option for all.
     Firstly, cigarette smoke has been known to cause great harm to one's respiratory system over long periods of time. This damage is less substantial to some, but it can be life-threatening to others. The soot and tar linger in the lungs for a lifetime, and many smokers have fallen prey to lung cancer. Thus, I would prefer to opt out of such circumstances entirely in a restaurant.
     Besides that, cigarette smoke can make public spaces less accessible for disabled people. Those who are struggling with respiratory issues such as asthma will be affected the most, as cigarette smoke could potentially trigger a sudden asthmatic reaction. The irritants in the smoke are known to aggravate such conditions. Thus, it is imperative that we make sure public spaces are accessible to the disabled community.
     Finally, cigarette smoke in restaurants can also be an issue for the owners of these establishments as well. If customers find themselves disturbed by the presence of cigarette smoke, they might be less prone to eat at restaurants. This blow to the business would be rather unfavorable to these owners. Thus, they should also have a say in banning smoking in restaurants.
     In conclusion, I believe it is necessary to take a strict stance against smoking in restaurants for the sake of our health and safety. This goes beyond profits and into the realm of the general well-being of the populace.
