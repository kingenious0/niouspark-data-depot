 I strongly agree that Smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants in this country. many health cases involving smokers and it increases every year. the rate of smokers also increased because now many young people follow the older people to smoke because they are attracted to such a lifestyle. smoking is very dangerous because the smoke is unpleasant to smell. as a result will cause lung failure. In recent times, there have also been many cases involving babies who died due to lung failure and difficulty breathing due to inhaling cigarette smoke. besides, it is not only famous for health problems, it also involves a high cost to buy the cigarette. the price charged is more expensive because it is an imported item from abroad. smoking has more disadvantages than advantages. it also affects an unhealthy lifestyle. this matter needs to be emphasized more by the government for the good of the people. for example, the government imposes expensive fines on those who smoke in restaurants and so on. besides that, the school also needs to take actions such as increasing the number of anti-smoking programs in order to nurture young children so that they do not become a group that is easily influenced by bad culture and become useful people.
