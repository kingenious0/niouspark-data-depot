Smokers not only endangers their lives but also people around them. I remember read an article saying that compared to smoker themselves, people around them are exposed to more than 70% of dangers of smoke. Thus, smoking in public places especially in restaurants is a serious offend and they should be given a very heavy punishment. Exposure of smoke especially in restaurants may put them in a very terrible health issue. Imagine kids, pregnant ladies, babies, or even heart problem people are exposed to this harm smoke. The smell itself may harm these people. Its not fair to harm others for the sake of own satisfaction. People who come to restaurant are craving for tasty food. Unfortunately, they are exposed to inhale the worst smell ever. This may lead to asthma attacks or cancer gradually. If there is a heart problem people in the restaurant and someone who is sitting next to them are smoking, this may cause death to the patient. The smell of the smoke attacks the heart and blood vessels which may cause in increasing of the heart attack and stroke. Some restaurants are in a closed area and the smoke are still inside the premises which may harm everyone in the premises. Thus, smoking in public places especially in restaurants should be strongly prohibited and serious penalty or punishment should be given as this may lead to death if no serious action taken by the authorities.
