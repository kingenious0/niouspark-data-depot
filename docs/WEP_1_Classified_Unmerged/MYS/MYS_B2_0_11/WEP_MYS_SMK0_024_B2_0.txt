 While banning smoking in all the restaurants in the country may seem a bit extreme from the first look, it really is not so when investigated in depth. Personally, I do agree that all restaurants in the country should ban smoking for multiple reasons. In this essay, I will discuss the most crucial of them.
To begin, the most important reason for banning smoking is its effect on non-smokers. No one is obligated to inhale the smoke that is produced by smokers. Not only it would be a major inconvenience for those in the area, but it would also severely affect their health in what is known as  Negative Smoking .
On another note, smoking can be done anywhere, so there is no sensual reason why smokers must do it inside a closed area with non-smokers around. Smokers can simply leave the premises to finish smoking, then enter back inside. There are also certain places with dedicated smoking areas, which is considered a fair solution if leaving the area is too much of a hassle.
In conclusion, I find that it is reasonable for restaurants across the country to ban smoking once and for all. However, restaurants can implement the idea of providing dedicated smoking spaces if they are keen to maintain their customers' satisfaction.
