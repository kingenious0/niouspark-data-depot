Many people have different perspectives on college students working a part-time job. In my opinion, it is important for college students to have a part-time job. This is because nowadays the cost of living is high. For instance, a college student's meal can go up to RM20 per day especially in urban areas like Kuala Lumpur and Johor Bahru. Meanwhile, students' living expenses can be slightly lower in rural areas. There are several advantages of working a part-time job. For instance, working a part-time job can help college students to develop and improve their soft skills such as communication skills, leadership skills, time management skills and other soft skills. Not only that, but they can add a working experience to their resume once they have finished their studies. They also can manage their own finance accordingly. Since they know how hard it is to obtain money, they will learn to manage their finance well. Additionally, students also tend to work part-time job during their final semester because they do not have to take many subjects as previous semesters. Thus, students have much free time during their final semester. All in all, college students need to learn how to manage their study and part-time job to make sure that they do not neglect their academic performance.
