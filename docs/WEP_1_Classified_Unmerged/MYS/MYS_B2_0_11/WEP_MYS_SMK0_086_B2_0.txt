 According to the statement, I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants in the country. A restaurant is a common area where everyone will gather around together to eat, therefore, there are many justifications for prohibiting smoking in restaurants. 

First and foremost, smoking should be prohibited in restaurants since it bothers non-smokers, especially while they are trying to enjoy their meals. Smoke can negatively affect diners, which can ruin their meal. A smoking ban in restaurants will alleviate this problem and provide a more comfortable environment for everyone. 

In addition, smoking is obviously bad for one's health, as well as the health of those around them.  Babies, young children, elderly people, and pregnant women are all exposed to secondhand smoke in restaurants. As a result, we may protect non-smokers from the negative effects of secondhand smoke by prohibiting smoking in public places like restaurants.

Besides that, restaurants should ban smoking since we need to promote a healthy way of living. A smoking ban in restaurants might motivate smokers to gradually reduce their public smoking, which could result in healthier people and the environment. In short, this can lower the number of smokers in public places.

In essence, the reasons indicated above are the reasons I believe smoking should be prohibited in all restaurants across the nation simply because it causes more harm than good. Smokers must be aware that they put their lives along with others in danger, hence they must respect others' rights too. To improve the environment of our community, those in charge of the restaurants and all other properties should ban smoking.
