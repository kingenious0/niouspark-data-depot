Yes, I agree. It is vital for a college student to have a part-time job because being a student has never been cheap. The majority of the students spend RM20 minimum per day. That is if we only count for food and exclude other expenses such as transportation, books and supplies, clothing, laundry, and entertainment. Hence, having a part-time job can help students to survive especially in this economy. Secondly, a part-time job helps students gain new experiences. This will be a huge help once they have graduated as it shows the work environment and the skills they are going to learn and hone while doing the part-time job. For example, Maya can get a job right away at a coffee shop because of her latte art as she has done a ton of practices during her time as a part-time barista. On top of that, it will strengthen a resume, leave a good impression, and guarantee a bright future because of the experiences, abilities, and talents written. Thus, a part-time job benefitted the students not only during their studies but also after they graduated. Lastly, it also helps students to manage time wisely. As we all know, it is challenging to complete lots of tasks with a packed schedule. However, when done right, everything is possible. Time management teaches you how to get more done in less time. Most importantly, it helps us to stop procrastinating instantly. In conclusion, college students should find a part-time job to lessen the burden they put on their parents in order to become independent.
