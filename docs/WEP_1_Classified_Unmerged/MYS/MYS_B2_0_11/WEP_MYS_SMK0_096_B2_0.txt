 I agree that smoking should be universally prohibited within all restaurants across the country. There are several reasons why it is advisable to do so such as health considerations, public safety and providing a pleasant environment.

First and foremost, smoking is hazardous for both smokers and non-smokers. With the action of banning smoking in restaurants, it will help to protect the health and well-being of customers and employees. This will reduce the probability of those people catching any health issues that are related to the consequences of smoking such as respiratory problems, asthma or dry cough.

Next, having a smoke-free policy in restaurants will enhance the overall safety of the public. This is said because it can decrease secondhand smoke exposure for non-smokers. Thus, it will protect their health, especially for vulnerable populations such as pregnant women, children and the elderly. Besides, it will also prevent any accidental fires on the premises. As a matter of fact, a smoke-free policy will ensure public safety and help protect lives and property.

Furthermore, without the smoke from cigarettes, it will improve the air quality around us. The toxic chemicals that were left behind by the smoke would create an unpleasant smell for anyone around. Thus, when smoking activities are eliminated, the air quality improves significantly. Hence, it will leave a clean and fresh atmosphere for everyone in the restaurants. This will allow all customers to enjoy their meals without the discomfort of smoking activities. 

In conclusion, I strongly agree with the statement to ban smoking completely in all restaurants across the country. By supporting a complete ban on smoking at all restaurants in the country, we can prioritize peoples' health, prioritize public safety and contribute to a pleasant environment for everyone.
