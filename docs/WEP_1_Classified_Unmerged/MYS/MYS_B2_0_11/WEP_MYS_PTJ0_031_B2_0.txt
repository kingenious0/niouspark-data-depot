 
Part-time jobs are jobs that are paid periodically based on the agreed working hours. There are various types of part-time job around us, from being a promoter in a retail store to a part time tuition teacher and so forth. The list of part time job is endless.  In my view, part time job could be a rewarding experience for college students who have loose class schedules. This is a pertinent consideration for college students to bear in mind because studies should be prioritized above any added responsibilities. 

There are several perks of having a part-time job as a college student. First, it gives you the satisfaction of having the ability to earn and generate income. On top of that, you will be able to spend and pay for items or services you need or want. Second, having a part time job allows you to gain working experiences and job-related skills whether it is administration, communication or even technical skill depending on the nature of the work. Many of these skills are transferable and practical skills you need in life. Third, it also enables you to build network by socializing and exposing yourself to people with similar or different walk of life. They are people who could be helpful to give you advice in your future endeavor. These are some of the benefits of having a part-time job. Therefore, it is definitely worthwhile to gain work experiences, earn and socialize if the nature of your studies allow you to do that.
