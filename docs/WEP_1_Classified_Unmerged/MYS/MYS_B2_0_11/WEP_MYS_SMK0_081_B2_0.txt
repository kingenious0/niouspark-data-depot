Yes, I agree. As what we taught about the impact of smoking, it can give you a bad or even worst impact for our health. Smoking have a big risk and chance of getting diseases such as lung disease and cancer. That is the most common disease when they always smoke. But, they still choose to smoke. Most worst things is when they are smoking in public places that there are so many people go whether a closed area or an open area such as in the restaurants. It is not only giva a impact to smoker but also to anyone who inhaled the cigarette smoke. It can increase the risk of developing heart disease. The pregnant women also have a big risk during their pregnancy when they are exposed to it. In fact, even they are not smoker, they still exposed to same things as active smokers. They also need to considered the health risk of the staff in the restaurant. Smoking in the restaurant should be ban so that their activity does not cause a harm to other people. The environment might effect to the food and drink as from a healthy food and drink to a bad ones as it get expose with polluted air such as cigarette smoke. In addition, if the children at the restaurant who already has Asthma and are exposed to the smoke, they will feel suffocate and then will be admitted in the hospital for the treatment. So, for me, I agree that smoking in public should be ban for better and healty environment. The smoker also need to remember that they should respect people around them and implement a healthy life cycle.
