I agree. It is important for college students to have a part-time job so that they can earn extra income for their needs. For example, when they need to but something or go to somewhere for the assignment purpose, they can use the money without using their saving money. With that, they will have a stabil income in the future. Student do not have to ask their parents for money anymore and also not give a trouble to their parents to give them money every month if they already have it when doing the part-time job. Other than that, when they do a part-time job, it can helps students in gain experience and develop great skills in working. The skills that student can get is communication, interpersonal skills, teamwork and more. When students doing their job, they learn how to interact with colleagues. For example, when they work as an intern or other profession and take part in any project, it can help them in jobs in the future. Student will know how to work with other people to complete the task or an assignment. In addition, working while studying can helps student to come out from their comfort zone as it will help them in handle many responsibilities, challenges in working and know how to overcome the problem. For example, if student is an introvert person, it will give them a chance to interact with many people. The student can make a new friends and can be more comfortable when they are around other people. It help student in build self-confidence. That is the reason why I agree with the statement  It is important for college students have a part-time job.
