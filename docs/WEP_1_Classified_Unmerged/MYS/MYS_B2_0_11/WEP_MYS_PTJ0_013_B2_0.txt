As for today, not everyone able to afford to study in a college due to a very large amount of fees required. The fees are incredibly high and those parents with low income have to struggle to pay it. Some parents can't work due to some illness or perhaps the students could be an orphan. Students from this type of background also need to study. No one can deny their right to study in the filed that they are interested in. everyone wants to study, but the cost of living in a college and the fees itself is a nightmare for these students. In this case, having a part time job is crucial for them as they might not want to burden their family. However, when these students work, they can't give full concentration on their study. This part time job is crucial for them to support their living in the colleges. Not only for living, they need money for their study as well as for stationeries, reference books and even for photocopying and binding. This definitely will create a hole in their pockets. In order to accommodate their study, part time job is important for them. Perhaps NGO and other political parties can find an alternative for this problem so that these future graduates can pursue their study with stress free mind. Scholarships are given, yet its not for all the students. We can still see young generations working in fast food restaurants and other premises as they are not able to afford the fees of the colleges.
