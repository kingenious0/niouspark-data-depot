 The  No Smoking  signs are commonly seen in various places, especially in indoor spaces. From digital to print media, we have seen and been educated of the harmfulness of smoking. This has naturally ingrained in us, so much so that when most people see cigarettes, they see red flags associating cigarettes as something bad for health.  I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all eateries in the country. 

In my view, restaurants are places meant for customers to enjoy their meal, the ambience and the dining experience. Providing a pleasant dining experience is an important aspect in food and beverage industry. Therefore, F&B industry should make sure dining regulation is in placed to prioritize their services and customers dine in experience.  Imagine breathing in the smoke from the neighboring table when you are having your meal. This is an immediate put off that makes your dining experience unpleasant. Besides that, exposure to smoke could cause discomfort to individual in different ways. Most importantly, the well-known health factor points out that smoking is bad for our health as it could lead to organ failure and decrease our life span. To consider this matter in a big picture, the disadvantages of smoking outweigh its benefit, therefore, smoking should be fully banned at all the restaurants in the country
