I agree that students need to do things on their own, like getting a part-time job while they learn. But I don't agree that it's important for students to have this kind of part-time job. because there is a choice. Students can get college loans from the government instead of doing this part-time work, so they don't have to work as hard to make money. Some students feel like they are a burden on their parents, while other students have to work part-time because their parents can't pay for all of their costs. Their families are having trouble making ends meet, so the students have to work part-time while they learn. On the other hand, it's good because that way can teach students to be more thrifty, independent, and disciplined so they're ready for the world of work when they grow up. For example, I'm a student who took out a government-funded education loan and will only work part-time when the semester break comes. I can't focus on two things at once. So, I have more money to spend and don't bother my parents with money issues. Finally, if they want a better life, pupils should always provide their best effort.
