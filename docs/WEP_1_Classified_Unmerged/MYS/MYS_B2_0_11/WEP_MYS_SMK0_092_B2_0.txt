 Smoking is known to be harmful to health and yet people are still doing it in public and private areas. I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country because of the secondhand smoke effect, expand the business and improving health rates.

 Secondhand smoke is harmful for the people who is around the active smokers. This will create serious health issues for people around them especially children, pregnant women and senior citizens who are in fragile state. For example health issues like respiratory infections, lung cancer and birth defects. If smoking is banned in all restaurants, it will create a healthier environment for the public including the workers.

 Implying smoke-free environments for restaurants would help to expand the business. Business owners will gain a lot of benefits such as larger group of customers, a great reputation of the restaurant and gain more profits. Smoke-free restaurants would not only attract non-smokers or any individuals that have health issues but also tourists from different countries. 

 Last but not least, banning smoking in public areas such as restaurants should be banned to increase our health rates. Banning smoking is a crucial step to stop youths from smoking. This is because restaurants are the public area where all ages of people are there and every action of the adults are being observed by the youths. Banning smoking in public restaurants will help to lower the risk of secondhand smoke and discouraging youths to smoke.

 In conclusion, I strongly agree to ban smoking in all restaurants across the country to minimize the secondhand smoke effect, expand the business and improve health rates. With the regulations, a healthier and more comfortable dining experience can be enjoyed by everyone.
