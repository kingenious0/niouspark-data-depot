Smoking is known to be the cause of many diseases such as lung disease, hypertension, and cancer. In Malaysia, many people have died from smoking since many years ago. Despite that some people are still not aware of the risk of smoking. In my opinion, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country as a stepping stone to be a smoke-free nation like Sweden. Even though they have the right to smoke, they should always be considerate of other people. Smoking in the restaurants does not only affect the smokers but also people around them. People around them who are exposed to the smoke can get secondhand smoke which can lead them to suffering from harmful health effects. This is especially dangerous to children. Many cases have proven that exposing to smoke can even cause death. Not only it is dangerous, smoking in the restaurants portrays a negative example to children. Since children can easily influenced by the surrounding, they might find that it is right to smoke at the restaurants. In Malaysia, people who smoke at the restaurants can face fines and imprisonment penalties. Thus, smoking at the restaurants can cause many negative consequences to the public.
