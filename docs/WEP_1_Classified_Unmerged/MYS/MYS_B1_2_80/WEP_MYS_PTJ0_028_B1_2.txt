In my opinion, I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job during their free time. As a college student, he or she needs to pay the tuition fees for every semester to continue the study. Apart from the tuition fees, there is other fees that need to be covered such as expenses for living, service fees and college fees to use the facility and services in university. Some might be able to pay the overall study and living cost during their study, but most of the students are not able to afford the cost and they have no choice but to apply the loan from the government. Malaysian government has provided the loan with the name of  PTPTN , with the aims on helping the local students to continue their study in tertiary education, and the students needs to pay back the loan with interest after their graduation. PTPTN had reduced students' burden on the study fee, but the leftover amount is not enough to cover other expenses due to the inflation. Hence, it is important for college students to have a part-time job so that they have enough money to cover their expenses. Beside that, the college students can be more discipline and independent with occupied a part-time job. They can learn to arrange their time well on managing their work-study balance, this allows them to be more punctual and they will finish the assignment early so that they can work without worrying about their homework. By having a part-time job, students can financially support themselves without asking helps from the family and starting to be more independent in their life. Apart from that, they will learn real skills instead of the theory taught in university through workplace.
