 Many students prefer to work as a part timer just to earn some pocket money to support their living. But do you know that majority who work part time job are from average or belong to poor family background where their parents can't even support their living and many siblings are needed  others to be supported. Indirectly, I would say most of them are forced to work part time besides studies. Therefore, in my opinion I think it is important for any college students to work as a part timer.Due to, self discipline, enlighten family burden and widen their job scope opportunity.
First of all, self discipline among themselves where they need to be balanced up between their work and studies wise or else they will be disqualified from respective universities or colleges if one couldn't achieve or maintain certain gradings. Also, they must be smart enough to arrange schedule accordingly so they won't neglect their academics at the same time.
Being a dutiful daughter or son in a family, must bear the responsibility of taking care of the family welfare just as simple as supporting family living expenses. In order to do so, one could work as a part timer just to enlighten the burden of their parents. 
In addition, widen job scope opportunity where one is engaged in a society earlier before they could graduate. Grabbing one opportunity which one is desired by any of us where communication brings the wide gap in fulfilling the job scope in future. For example,working as a waiter or waitress could train their confident level to speak with others in future without any fearfulness. 
In conclusion, self discipline, enlighten family burden and seizing job opportunity are the eyes opening for them to work as part timers besides being a student.
