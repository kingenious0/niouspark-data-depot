Yes, I would be one of those who totally agree with college students having a part-time job. There are many reasons why having a part-time job whilst studying is crucial. First and foremost, students need extra money to study comfortably; considering equipment and materials that they require to maximise their interests and attention in study. The learning process would be less interrupted if these students are able to buy things easily, without worrying the shortage of fund which have been provided by parents or any loan provider. Secondly, it is as an early exposure of gaining experience at work. Every circumstance that they encounter at work matters in developing their perspectives and knowledge. Students who face more problems would obviously solve more problems than those who only study at college and this would increase their problem-solving skills. Lastly, most students nowadays are exhaustively influenced by the use of technology and these tools are not cheap at all; perhaps one source of income might not sufficient. In regards to that, infusing technology in classroom is totally effective in providing students with the latest update and easy access of information. Imagine if students have not enough money to spend on technological tools to enhance their learning experience? One thing for sure, they would feel left behind. Therefore, it is vital for students to have a part-time job despite of challenges at work as the outcome of having extra money will always be positive.
