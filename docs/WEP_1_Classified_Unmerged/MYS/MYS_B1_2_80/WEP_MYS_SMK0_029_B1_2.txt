Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, I completely agree to this statement because smoking is always not a good thing to do especially in public place like restaurant. Nowadays, there are many stubborn smokers who likes to ignore the reminder or notice in every restaurant and proceed to smoke for their own enjoy and pleasure. These scenes should not be happened in every country in the sense that there is already a place provided for them to smoke legally. Smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country because smoking not only have an impact on the smoker but also to the people near them. For example, Uncle Pang always smoke during his lunch together with his family in local restaurants, but in the end , his wife and his son was diagnosed that they have weak lungs due to the secondary smoke they breath in. This is because the secondary smoke is more harmful than the original smoke. Smoking in restaurant should be banned because it brings many discomforts to public and other customers. If there is customer who has asthma in the restaurant, smoke may cause them to hurt their lungs and harm their health. Thus, smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country.
