 First of all, as a student we need to have part-time job to earn some money. As we know, the money from PTPTN is not enough for students to use it for the whole semester. This is so crucial especially if we are studying at USM located at Penang Island. The cost living must be a little bit high compared to the other university. So, as I mentioned earlier, the money from part time job for students can be use for rent home, buy books, uniform, official t-shirt and food. Thus, if the students have more money, they could buy anything they want. They will not burden their parents to give some money instead they could earn the money. 

Other than that, the part time job is also benefits for students to use free time to work. As we know, the schedule for the university is not the same as at high school. So, the students will have more free time. If the students work as part time job, they will not spend their time with the social problems such as cyberbully and so on. They will more appreciate their time to use for the right things. They will also be more energetic to work harder in their life. 

Last but not least, part time job also will help students to divide their time sufficiently. There were a time where students need to be more aware to go to class or to work. So, during this time, students will also have a schedule for himself. The students also will learn lots of new skills in work life which is communication. Communication skills help students to do work better in the future.
