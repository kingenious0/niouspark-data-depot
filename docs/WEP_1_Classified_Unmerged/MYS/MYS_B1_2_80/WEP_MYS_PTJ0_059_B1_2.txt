  Yes, I do agree that it's important for the college student to have a part-time job because some students have financial problems whether serious or not that serious. By doing so students can cover all of their educational needs such as fees, books, and many more. Sometimes they just don't want to totally rely on their parents since they think they have other siblings that need their parents' money as well. Having your own backup money can lead students to a lot of advantages. Next is time management, as we know that part-time jobs need a balance between work and study. For example, how to prioritize tasks, do the assignment before the deadlines, and achieve a healthy work balance. Part-time jobs lead students to have healthy time management by working during their studies. Besides, it can enhance students' resumes because having a lot of works experiences can make you stand out among your peers.

This connection will lead to job opportunities because students have the skills to communicate and interact with people correctly. Lastly, personal growth, helps students to perform better in their lives, for example, boost their confidence, be more independent, handle responsibility, and make decisions on their own. They can manage their behavior and accomplish better in life if they have this kind of experience. In a nutshell, having a part-time job is quite crucial for individuals who are experiencing financial difficulties. Therefore, as students, we require financial stability for life.
