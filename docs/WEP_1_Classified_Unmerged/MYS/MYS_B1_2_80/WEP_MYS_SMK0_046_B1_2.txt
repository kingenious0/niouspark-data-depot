      I strongly agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country because smoking is a harmful habit that puts both smokers and non-smokers at considerable risk for health problems. The problems will affect others is health risks from passive smoking, protecting restaurant staff, and raising awareness of social responsibility and the public.
     First, it is impossible to ignore the risks to a person's health caused by smoking and passive smoking. The negative effects of second-hand smoke on human health, including an increased risk of heart disease, cancer, and asthma, have been shown by many scientific research. The health of everyone would be protected by a comprehensive smoking ban in restaurants, will give a better environment for everybody.
     Second, we should care about restaurant staff because they spend so much time in restaurant where smoking is permitted. The restaurant's staff should work in a risk-free, healthful environment that is free of pollutants. Restaurant employees' health would be safeguarded by an entire ban on smoking, which would also show that employers care about their health.
     Lastly, raising awareness of social responsibility and the public is something that we should do to encourages that smoking is a bad habit and that the public's health comes before personal choice. A strong sense of social responsibility would be shown by such a ban, proving that society is concerned in protecting people's health. As a result, this may help the restaurant sector grow and maintain its reputation as a source of safety and healthy food.
     In conclusion, a complete ban on smoking in restaurants is required to protect the public's health, provide safe environments for restaurant staff, and demonstrate social responsibility.
