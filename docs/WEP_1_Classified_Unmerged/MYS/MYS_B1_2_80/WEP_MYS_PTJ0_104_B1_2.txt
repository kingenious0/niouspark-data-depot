"It can be seen that nowadays, many students are working part-time to sustain their college lives which is actually important. Hence, this essay will elaborate the reasons why a part-time job is vital for college students.

Primarily, money becomes vital for everyone and college students are not excluded especially when some of them are not supported by scholarship or allowance. As known by many, students have their own commitment too and not everything is provided by their college. Sometimes, they need to spend some money for their necessities like books and stationery and imagine how stressful it would be for them to suffocate financially while having to focus on their academic. Hence, working part-time will somehow ease their financial problems as they can use their salary for the necessities. 

Additionally, being a worker and a student at the same is not easy at all as it requires a person to have time management skill. As a student that in the future will be employed somewhere, they are able to learn and adapt with busy and hectic schedule. For instance, a college student that has classes early in the morning may negotiate with their employer to schedule their working hours on night shift. The commitment does not stop there as he has to still make time for doing his assignment or revision. This illustrates that time management skill is being practised when a college student have a part-time job and this skill is guaranteed to benefit him hugely.

To conclude, a part-time job benefit college students for countless reasons. Furthermore, they should balance their life as a student and a worker to maximise the benefits."
