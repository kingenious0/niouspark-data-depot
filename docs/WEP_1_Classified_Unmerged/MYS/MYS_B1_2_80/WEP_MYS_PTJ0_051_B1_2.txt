 No, I disagree with the statement above. In my opinion, college students should fully have committed on their study. The first reason is because college students are responsible for themselves. The lecturers will teach the students about the syllabus and explained about the assignments and that is it. If the students did not understand the lectures or the assignments, they need to understand it using their own ability. The lecturers would not spoon feed them. There are some students that brave enough that will ask the lecturers more about the lecturers and assignments. There are also students that prefer to search and learn about the lectures and assignments by their own ability through internet or asking their friends. In simple words, students need to take care of themselves because the lecturers would not spoon feed them.  
The second reason is time management. College students normally have classes on the weekdays from 8am until 5pm. They work part-time job from 6pm until 10pm or more. It can clearly be seen that, there would not be time left for them to do their assignments, revisions or home works because of lacks of time. If they had time after their part-time job, they would rather sleep or rest because they are tired from their part-time job. They would not be able to finished their assignments due of lack of time and poor time managements.
In conclusion, I do not think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. They should fully focus on their study first because that is their main responsibility.
