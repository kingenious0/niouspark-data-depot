 The statement  smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country , I totally agree with this statement.  Smoking is a severe health risk that leads to a variety of diseases and medical issues. To protect all people from the negative impacts of smoking, many countries have banned smoking in public areas. But in several countries, smoking continues to be accepted in restaurants. I think smoking should be totally stopped in all restaurants throughout the entire country.
        Smoking at restaurants can be damaging for both smokers and non-smokers. When someone smokes at a restaurant, the smoke expands the environment and exposes customers to indirect smoke. Lung cancer, heart disease, and asthma are just a few of the health issues caused by indirect smoke. Vomiting and headaches, indirect smoke could have such symptoms in non-smokers.
        By making it difficult to smoke in public areas, more people will choose to stop smoking. Additionally, it reduces the risk of exposure to indirect smoke, potentially stopping the growth of multiple illnesses and medical problems. In addition to making it easier for people to breathe fresh air, the prohibition on smoking in restaurants may also encourage smoke-free environments.
        Finally, smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants across the entire country. By reducing exposure to indirect smoke, the ban will lead to the health protection of smokers and non-smokers as well. It will be easier for people to breathe fresh air according to the smoking prohibition in restaurants, which will have lots of positive effects on public health. As a result, it's critical that the government establish a prohibition on smoking in public places in order to create an atmosphere in which everyone can live comfortably.
