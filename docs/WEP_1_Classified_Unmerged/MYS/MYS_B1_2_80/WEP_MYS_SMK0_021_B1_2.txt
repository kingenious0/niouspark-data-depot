In this new globalization, the world is still tried to solve the problem of smoking especially at restaurant. Ministry of Health Malaysia have done a lot of rules and regulation to prevent smoking at restaurant. Some smokers pretend to not follow it. The last resort from my opinion is to banned the smoking at all the restaurant in the country. Firstly, smoking at the restaurant can cause uncomfortable smell as the smoke from the cigarette interrupt some customers to eat. People just want to have enjoy moment when eating and when interrupted with something unpleasant, there are no enjoy of it. Furthermore, as stated from Ministry of Health Malaysia, third party smoker, which is the person who do not smoke but inhale the smoke from cigarette, tend to get lung cancer due to high content of carcinogen. In cigarette, a lot of toxic chemicals exist and can cause a lot of illness such as asthma, sore throat and others. Thus, cigarette should be banned at all restaurant so that customers can enjoy food and have happy moment together. In conclusion, smoking should be banned at all restaurant in the country because this can help customers to enjoy their foods and drinks, socializing and uninterrupted with unpleasant smells. Banning smoking will also reduce the possibility of people to get sick as smoking can cause a lot of illness.
