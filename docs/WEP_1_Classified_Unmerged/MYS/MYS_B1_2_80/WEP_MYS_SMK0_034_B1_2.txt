Yes, I agree. I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants because people at the restaurant can be very uncomfortable with the smoke and some smokers do not have any consciousness in public. For example, some of them will just smoke in front of others and people who have health problems, especially those who have a respiratory problem, will suffocate when they smell the smoke. Next, it can reduce the population of people who have a smoking related illness. This is because some of the hospitals do not have enough staff to cover all the patients at once. For example, they need to focus more on other patients who have cancer or serious health problems. Last but not least, smoking should be banned because it can have a bad influence on younger generations. In this generation, some of them, especially teenagers, would like to try everything what they see. If they try, they will get a health problem at a such young age. Instead of bringing a bad influence, it is better to be a role model for younger generations. For example, have a nice body and a good lifestyle. This is because young generations tend to know how you have a nice body and how your lifestyle is like. Just with it, they will follow in your steps and make you a role model. In conclusion, I would really appreciate it if smoking could be completely banned at all restaurants or any places because it would bring a healthy environment and people will be happy ever after.
