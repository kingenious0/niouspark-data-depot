           Young people today often smoke. However, it has negative health effects on smokers and anyone who inhales the smoke. So, I strongly agree that smoking should be banned in public areas, especially around restaurants, as it has several negative consequences for the general public.
          Firstly, I agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants in this country because smoking is bad for our health. Active smokers often suffer from various diseases including heart problems and tuberculosis. Although symptoms may take some time to manifest, they eventually cause serious problems. It affects smokers as well as others around them. Therefore, since both active and passive smokers may become ill, there must be widespread public support for a complete ban on smoking in restaurant premises.
          Another reason why I agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants is because it can degrade the taste of the food. This is because the food has been exposed to cigarette smoke. Food exposed to cigarette smoke will affect the quality of the food. Customers also feel uninterested in buying food whose quality is definitely contaminated by cigarette smoke. This has a negative impact on restaurant owners as sales revenue declines.
          Finally, smoking should be banned because being around smokers makes non-smokers feel uncomfortable. Pregnant women, the elderly and small children find it difficult to adjust to the smoke-filled atmosphere. Public smoking especially in restaurants should be banned as it greatly increases irritation.
          In conclusion, smoking should be banned in all restaurants because it is not good for health, lowers the taste of food and makes non-smokers feel uncomfortable. Although it is quite difficult to curb because there are billions of people who smoke, but it needs to be banned immediately because it has a bad effect on the people and the country.
