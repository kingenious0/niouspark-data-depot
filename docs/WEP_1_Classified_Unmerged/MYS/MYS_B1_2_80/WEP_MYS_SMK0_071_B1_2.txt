 Nowadays, we often hear that cigarettes can have serious harmful effects on individuals who like to smoke. Even so, smoking has become a habit in society currently. There are various negative effects that will be experienced by smokers and individuals who inhale cigarette smoke. I agree with the statement   smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants in this country  . This is because it can deal with the risk of disease in the community.
Smoking will have negative effects such as the occurrence of chronic diseases. Chronic diseases such as lung cancer can occur because of smoking regularly. As we know, in cigarettes there are harmful substances such as nicotine. This has resulted in smokers becoming addicted to smoking and finding it difficult to quit smoking. Cigarette smoke that has been inhaled and released will enter the lung space where it will affect the lungs. The effects experienced do not happen quickly, but this can be avoided if there is awareness to stop smoking.
Recently, smoking in public such as in a restaurant will cause discomfort to the public. There are individuals who are sensitive to the smell of cigarette smoke, and it will have a harmful effect on the community, especially pregnant women, elderly people, children, and individuals with asthma. If smoking in a restaurant, it will disturb other individuals to eat. Every customer has the right to feel comfortable in the restaurant and get good service.
This clearly shows that there should be a banned-on smoking in public places especially in restaurants to protect the health of the community and our common peace.
