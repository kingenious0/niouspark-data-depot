I disagree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. In my opinion, students should focus more on their studies than having a part-time job. It is because doing two things at the same time could be a burden to them, which in turn could affect their academic performance. Furthermore, students' health can be affected mentally and physically. With too much on their plate, students would be too stressed, which would make their health conditions worse. Other than that, students would spend less time with themselves and their loved ones. As part-time jobs and studies take up most of their time in a day, students rarely have time to rest or spend time with their families. Because of that, students will be exhausted, and their family bonds will be strained. Furthermore, students are not able to arrange their time well. As time is precious, students would rush to attend a class in between their part-time jobs. Due to this, students possibly did not attend class and did not do any tasks given by the lecturer. In a nutshell, I believe that studying while working a part-time job has various disadvantages that could affect the student.
