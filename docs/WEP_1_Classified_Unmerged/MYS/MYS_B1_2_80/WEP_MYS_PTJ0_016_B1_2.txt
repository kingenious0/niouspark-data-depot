 Recently, taking part-time jobs among college students seems to be a trend. There are various part-time jobs, ranging from waiter to tuition teacher. The reasons most students take part-time jobs are because they need more pocket money to pay for their academic finances or buy luxury items. Is it important for college students to have a part-time job? Well, I guess everyone will give a different answer. In my opinion, it is not necessary to have a part-time job as a must and I disagree with the title. 
First, taking a part-time job will surely used up most of the time, making the time for studies becoming lesser. As a student, the most important role is to study well and learn in college. It is ok if the part-time jobs will not affect your studies, but if yes, then better give up the part-time jobs. It is because we still have lots of chances to take jobs after we graduate.
Second, by having part-time jobs, students can gain experience in working. However, joining co-curriculum should be a better alternative. By joining co-curriculum, students can learn even more about their major and be able to make friends with the same interest. If doing part-time, they might only work alone or learn skills which are not applicable in their major.
In conclusion, it is not wrong for a college student to have a part-time job, but bear in mind that the part-time jobs should be legal and this decision should not affect the role as a college student.
