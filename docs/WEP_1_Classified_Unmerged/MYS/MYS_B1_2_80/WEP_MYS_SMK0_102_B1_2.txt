 I am agree that smoking should be ban at all of the restaurants at the country. First of all, smoking is totally could harm your health. There are so many research and findings regarding to this issue. There are so many campaingns were held to give awareness to public about this smoking issue. Bit unfortunately, nothing happen. There are so many people are still smoking especially at the restaurant. People need to stop smoking at public because there are lots of people at the restaurant including the babies. The babies could get affected by the cigarettes. 

Second, the smoking at the restaurants will make the customers felt uncomfortable to eat there. I believe that everyone wass not enjoyed having a lunch while people still smoking at the other table. This is impolite manners that people are trying to show of to others. Believe me that smoking will not making you look good instead you look so pathetic. 

Last but not least, smoking at restaurant also will affect the view of ourself. People will view you as a lower standard class. You will not get the same respect as others. This is because you are not respecting other people's. People will always look at you with some manner's problem and eventually will potrayed the bad things about yourself.
