 I totally agree with that. It's because smoking in public areas, especially restaurants, makes you appear rude and disrespectful. Not only that, but everyone around you might hate you for it. For example, even your closest relatives, such as your own daughter, could be affected. Besides, exposing them to the dangerous smell of your cigarette smoke can harm their health, particularly pregnant women. A study done by University of Malaya found that the smoke from ciggarate can cause harm or malformation to the fetus. .

Moreover, the quality of the air is also affected. Nowadays, air pollution is really bad, and just by smelling it, you can end up coughing. Finally, your friends might abandon you because of this habit. Those who dislike smokers will mock you for smoking and constantly advise you against it, as they are aware of its negative impact on health.

In conclusion, smoking should always be banned in all restaurants.Smoking has many bad effects. It can make people think you're rude, and it can harm the health of others. It also makes the air dirty and can make friendships difficult. That's why it's important to have places where smoking is not allowed, so everyone can feel safe and happy.
