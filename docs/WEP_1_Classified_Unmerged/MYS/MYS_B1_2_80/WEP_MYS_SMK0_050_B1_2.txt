 Yes, I'm agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. They have many reasons that why smoking should be banned. For the first reason is smoking can affect people who sit around the smoker or the synonym name that called a passive smoker. When they inhale the smoke from cigarette it can have a same effect like the smoker. Its happen because the chemical that people inhale the smoke and it will be dangerous to people, especially pregnant women that also can affect their baby. Research from KKM said a Passive smoker also can have a same effect like the smoker.IN that case we should banned smoking around the restaurant.    
        Other than that smoke around the restaurant will make the bad environment around the restaurant. Why smoke around restaurant make the bad environment it is because when they smoking around people that eat it will make the other person turn off to eat their food. People come to restaurant to enjoy the food and not to be a passive smoker that will affect their life.    
        Last but not least, it will give bad influencer to a child. As we known restaurant is a public place and when an elder smoking around the restaurant the children will saw that and they will have a thought to try smoking. It's can be dangerous to them and it will make a habit because smoking since children. In conclusion, smoking at the public place such as restaurant is a wrong and need to be banned. It's just not effected the smoker it's also effected to people and the enviroment. People who smoke can smoking far away from restaurant. If the still smoke around the restaurant, authorities can compound them.
