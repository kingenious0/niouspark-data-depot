 	In my opinion, I agree with the idea of a college student having part-time jobs. One of the several reasons is that college students should begin to develop the capability to live independent financially, in other words, live without the financial support from their parents. Most college students are already adults (assuming the age more than 18 is classified as adult), they should possess some sense of responsibility towards themselves and their families by understanding that there is no free lunch in this world. They should understand in the previous years ever since that they are born, they are practically living off their families, to put it in a bad way, lived like a parasite. However, that only holds true if they do not improve their self-worth and working part time jobs is a good start by reducing the financial responsibility of their families. In my opinion, it is not necessary for college students to live only on paychecks from part-time jobs. It should be sufficed if they can pay for their own wants (anything results from their desire). 
	Next, working part-time jobs helps improve self-worth. As mentioned above, as an adult, it is important to realize that the reality is that we are all building blocks for this society, for better or worse reasons, and society will quickly reject those who do not bring benefits to the community. To achieve self-improvement, part-time jobs may be the quickest way aside from joining co-curricular activities. This is because almost all jobs are striving to complete tasks within their scope with minimum effort, time, and capital, at the same time maximizing profit. For example, a creative and innovative person often able to bring in fresh ideas that people quickly develop interest in, this may be a business opportunity.
