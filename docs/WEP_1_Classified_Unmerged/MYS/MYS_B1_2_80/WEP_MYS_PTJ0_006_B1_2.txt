 I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
Firstly, with part-time job, students can earn their pocket moneys without asking the financial support from their respective families. The pocket money earned can be used to pay their study fees andddx life expenses such as rental fee, electricity bill, water bill and many more. The decision of doing part-time job can help students and their families to reduce the financial burden and support their daily lives. Moreover, having a part-time job can provide experience to the students which is beneficial to their futures. They will acquire both soft skills and hard skills which can improve their competencies in the future. For instance, if he or she is working as a part-time cashier at coffee shop, he or she must be able to communicate with customers fluently without any difficulty. Besides, works as a customer-service staff can greatly improve one's communication and interpersonal skills. Furthermore, having a part-time job allows students to expand their networks including the customers, colleagues and employers. Those students who had working experience might have higher adaptability compared to those who does not have any working experience. In a nutshell, I think the advantages of working as a part-timer are more than the disadvantages, therefore I suggest students to do a part time job to improve their skills.
