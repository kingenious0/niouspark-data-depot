No, I disagree with the statement given above. In my opinion, to have a part-time job as a students is a choice for them and its not that important. It could be inconvenient for them to study and do a job even it is part-time because it could bother their focus in their study. As a student, study should be their first responsibility. If they do part-time job, their academic performance could be affected because they will feel exhausted from work and do not have time to do their assignments or study. The grades also will be affected because of lack of time and energy. Then, if they do part-time, they also would be less time for themselves because other than study, students also need to have their own time for themselves too. They need to rest to make sure they have perfect energy to go to the class and to do their study activities. Moreover, as a student, they may felt depressive if they could not catch up the lesson. So, if they do part-time job it may lead to mental health issues if it affected their academic performance. Students also do not have good rest and may get sick if they are lack of sleep or overwork.
