From my opinion, I disagree with the statement that it is important for college students to have part-time job. The reasons why I disagree is, as a student we need to focus on our major decision. When someone is working while he or she study, they cannot give a full attention to their study. They cannot finish or do their best when done their assignments and task that give by their lecturer. They also have a lot of problems that have to be settle. In this case, academic performance can be affected with the limited time management to balance their study and part-time job. They have to find out the strategy for dealing with stress. Find a pastime that makes you feel calmer, such as exercising or keeping a diary. It has been established that exercise effectively reduces stress. To lessen the stress of learning to work and study, the students also need to take a good care of themselves. For example, the students that do a part-time job, did not have a good or enough sleep. This will effect their concentration level in class. Even every student is different the level of wisdom, but we need to protect it before the academic performance become at the lowest. Nothing can we expect except all the things going smoothly when you are a student.
