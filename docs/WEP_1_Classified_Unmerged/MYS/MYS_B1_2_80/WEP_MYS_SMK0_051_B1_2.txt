 Yes, I agree with the statement above. The first reason is because it will make people uncomfortable. If there are people smoking in a restaurant, the smoke will go everywhere. They will smell the bad smell of the smoke. The customers at the restaurant will feel uncomfortable. They are also many people that will feel dizzy and want to puke if the smell the cigarettes smoke. They would not be able to eat and enjoy their food in peace because of the smoke. 
 The second reason is regarding health issue. People that inhale the cigarettes smoke is consider as a second-hand smoker. They may get disease regarding their lung.  Although they do not smoke by themselves it will put their health in danger because of other person action. Imagine if our family is the victim. What would we feel about it? Sounds outrageous right. The baby is the one that will be affected badly if they inhale the smoke. Many cases have been stated that baby died because of the cigarettes smoke. They are also some that survive but will be sick for the rest of their life. I do no think it is fair because they need to be a victim because of other people action.  
 In conclusion, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because it brings harm to everyone.
