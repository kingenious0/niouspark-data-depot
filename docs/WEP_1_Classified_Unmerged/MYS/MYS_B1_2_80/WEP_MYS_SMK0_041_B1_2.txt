Yes, I agree. As what all have known, smoking is really dangerous not only to the smokers, but it also affects the people around them. Restaurants are mostly enclosed space, which means it has no suitable ventilation to air out the smoke. This will harm people inside the restaurants, especially kids and old folks since they are the more vulnerable to the smoke. Inhaling the smoke can give people bad effects such as cough, asthma, or worse, heart attack. There have been cases where passive smokers are more likely affected by the smoke. On the other hand, the smoke can also contaminate the food and might cause food poisoning to the visitors. Thus, the restaurants' managers should put up a no smoking sign at their premises so that people can be aware of their actions. Other than that, the authorities should take appropriate actions if there are people who refuses to smoke outside of the restaurants by compounding them. Hence, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because it literally brings no good to the society, other than harms. Smokers should also have common senses when it comes to smoking at an eating area, and they should go and smoke at a more open space or a designated area for smoking.
