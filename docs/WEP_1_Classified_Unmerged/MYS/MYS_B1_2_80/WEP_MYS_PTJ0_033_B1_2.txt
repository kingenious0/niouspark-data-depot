 I would certainly agree with the issue here which nowadays it is quite a hustle for an individual especially a college student to make ends meet. I would begin to say it is predominant for these students to find a better alternative to survive by having a part-time job. To survive in college, they need to be financially, physically, and mentally stable unless it would be a problem if they were not able to do that. Not every person came from a wealthy family, there are some who could not even eat at least three times a day like other lucky individual do. Living alone without family in college is a huge responsibility and challenge as everything need to be done by ourselves. One of the prime reasons why college students need to have a part-time job is it can provide them with extra financial support. Renting a room, buying books and foods along with paying for tuition fees are some of the things that worry them the most. Other than that, some students are not coming from a financially stable family and some might come from middle-class family. Students whom family are struggling to survive each day really think that it is a good opportunity for them to get a part time job since it would help their family. In most cases, students do pay their own tuition fees as their family could not afford to help them financially. Hence, they also need to provide their family with necessities. Moreover, some college students think that having a part time job will make them to become independent person as they can provide their own financial sources without depending on their family. It is good for them as they now know their own responsibilities and commitment to live by their own.
