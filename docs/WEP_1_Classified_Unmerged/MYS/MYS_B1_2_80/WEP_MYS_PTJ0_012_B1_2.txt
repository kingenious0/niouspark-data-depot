I am fully agreeing that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Nowadays, the prices of everything are increasing year by year and people also pursuing for higher quality of life. As a college student, not only that we need to spend for the school fees but there are also more expenses like food, live place, transport and so on that we need to worry about. For some students with better grades, they might able to get a scholarship thus no need to worry about these expenses but for the poor students with lower grades, the easiest way for them to cover these expenses is to find a part-time job. By having a part-time job, students will be able to fill up their stomach and live in a good place. Apart from that, students can also have a savings which might come in handy during emergency occur. Besides, having a part-time job will provide us with much more working experience that can be written into resume which will help us after graduation. By spending time on the part-time job, we utilise our free time in a good way and preventing us to waste our time on activities that are unbeneficial to our future. In conclusion, college students should try to get a part-time job as it brings us so much benefits during college and after graduation.
