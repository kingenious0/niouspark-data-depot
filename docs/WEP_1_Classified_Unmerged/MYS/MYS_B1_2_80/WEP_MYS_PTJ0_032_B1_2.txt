Yes, I do agree with this statement. As the cost of living has increased per year, students are struggling to make their ends meet. This being said, financial issues have become a big issue for students where students usually have to limit their food intake on a daily basis just to make sure they could survive for another day. Hence, it is important to find ways to get some pocket money by working part time job. The biggest motivation to work a part-time job is money. A stable cash flow gives students the much-needed freedom to live comfortably while also getting rid the fear of not having any money to be spent on their live expenses. Another justification for taking up a part time job is that students will learn how to manage their money well. When students start earning their own money, they naturally start being more cautious when spending the money. Therefore, students will learn budgeting and money management skills which will help them a lot as they got older. Part time jobs also provide students with work experiences which definitely helpful to strengthen and boost their resume. Real-world work experience will not only give students an advantage over fresh graduates but also shows your commitment and diligence, which all employers love to work with.
