 Yes, I do agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country because it will leave bad effects on human beings, especially secondhand smoke. For example, it will lead to heart disease, lung cancer, and respiratory issues. By doing so, we can reduce all of the diseases caused by smoke and have a better surroundings. Next is the air pollution that has been so harmful caused by smokers around the restaurant. For instance, I usually get mad when there's a baby and some smokers still smoking near the baby's place. By banning the smoke around the restaurant customers can enjoy their food peacefully. Besides, it can avoid fires that will burn all of the restaurants and will kill people because there have some materials that easily burn such as gas tanks, fabrics, and many more. Subsequently, when the restaurant is noticeably smoke-free, it promotes the business. Furthermore, families with children, the elderly, or someone with a health problem would prefer to go to a free-of-smoke restaurant than others just for good. Last but not least, it can prevent a confrontation between customers or employees because certain nasty things happen, such as tossing cigarettes all over the place. This way, we can avoid such an occurrence and everyone can enjoy their meals joyfully. In conclusion, smoking really leave lots of rotten effects on human beings. So as a community that lives in the same universe, we should take responsibility to take care of each other.
