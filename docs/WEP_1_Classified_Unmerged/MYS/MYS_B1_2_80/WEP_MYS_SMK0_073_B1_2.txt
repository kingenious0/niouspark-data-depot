In my opinion, I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. This is because restaurants are the place to eat with families and friends including parents and children. It is simple to say, but it is more difficult to find a restaurant especially for non-smokers. It is not a major issue in larger cities, but it is in smaller cites and towns. It can be harmful and dangerous, especially for children when they smell smoke, or we call it second-hand smokers. Plus, there are a lot of dangerous ingredients in cigarettes that can also affect people who smell it. For example, they can also suffer from lung cancer and heart disease.  In addition, smoking can cause air pollution and global warming. A person will have difficulty breathing when close to a smoker. The owner of the restaurant also will lose their customers and affect the level of their income because of the smoker disturbing others to eat and drink peacefully. Everyone has their right to eat and breathe in clean air without any cigarette smoke. So, to conclude, we should have a common sense especially in public area so that we can live comfortably and peacefully.
