" Yes, I completely agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. 
 The first reason links to the health issues brought by smokers to their environment. The smoke exhaled by them affect the people around them by causing them to risk catching diseases that are nesting in the smoker's lugs. In a restaurant packed with people, this danger may fall upon children, sick people or the elderly that struggle with their immunity. For example, if an elderly with asthma breath in this smoke, then their lungs may be attacked by harmful pathogens that originated from the smoker's organ. Hence, this could worsen the health of innocent customers that simply want to have their fill in an establishment peacefully. In fine, banning smoking at all restaurants in the country should be authorized as it affects other people's health. 
 Then, smoking can also ruin customers' experiences in a restaurant easily. Since the old times, people generally know that smelling is highly connected to the taste of the dish served. A good smell can indicate the tastiness of the food, which greatly arouses the eater's appetite and excitement of consuming it. In restaurants, particularly ones with a closed space, this aspect of enjoying food will be removed as the mouthwatering smell will be blocked with the smoke's overwhelming smell. For instance, in a café, customers will miss the special atmosphere exclusive to coffee shops as the smell of roasted coffee beans is replaced with smoke. 
 All in all, smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the county because it causes health issues and may negatively affect customer's experience. I hope the authorities will take these reasons into consideration when the time comes to decide in enforcing this long overdue ban.
