The importance of a student's life is studying hard and achieving the experiences during their life in university. Yet, some students opt to be a part-timer to earn side income while they are at university. They claim that they need some extra money for their daily expenses and fees as a student to buy food, groceries and snacks. I strongly disagree that it is essential for college students to have a part-time job because it causes them sleep deprivation and lack of participation in class. First and foremost, making time for being a part-timer is physically tiring as students are already mentally drained by all the classes and assignments. Working for hours after hours of classes will only causes you fatigueness. As the result, students will deal with sleep deprivation as they need to stay up to complete their pending assignments. They should be financially stable as most of the students get to apply for scholarship and they should not be worrying too much on earning the extra money. Secondly, some students who have been doing a part-timer will be totally lost and left behind as they are lack of participation in lecture classes. Not attending the classes for more than three times will cause them to be barred in examination. As the result, they will not be able to graduate if they failed the course. As the conclusion, being a university student is meant to be enjoyable and stress-free. They should not be worrying about financial status as university has the organization of helping the unfortunate students. Being a part-timer is not the only solution to be financially stable.
