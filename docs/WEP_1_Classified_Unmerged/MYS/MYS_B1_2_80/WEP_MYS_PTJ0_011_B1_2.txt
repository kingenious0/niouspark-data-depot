 In my opinion, as a student, I strongly agree that having a part-time job is really important. Part-time jobs are like preparation for us, students before officially entering real society. As a student, having a part-time job, helps us to gain experience in many ways. For example, as a waiter, we are required to communicate with customers and co-workers in English throughout whole working days. This enables us to be trained and improved our communication skills which directly helped us to be more confident in speaking in English. Other than that, during part-time jobs, we might face some unpredictable situations and it requires us to react quickly and think fast in order to solve the problems. This could definitely help college students in their academics and also during their interview sections for a company, as it strongly improves their critical thinking and flexibility skills. 
	According to the economy of Malaysia, all the prices of food, transportation, and other necessities increased to a high level. Everything is considered expensive, especially for a college student. By having a part-time job, college students will be able to have side incomes to help to cover the expenses of their daily activities, tuition fees, and college fees. With good incomes, students will have the freedom to participate in extracurricular events. This helps students to gain more knowledge other than academics and improve their social skills during these events.
	In conclusion, college students having a part-time job is important as it helps students to improve their confidence, social skills, and communication skills. It also provides freedom for students to participate interested events or spend on their hobbies.
