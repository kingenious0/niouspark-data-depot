Yes, I agree. I think it is important for college students to have a part time job because they can earn their own money and they also can learn not to rely on their parents. This is because some college students do not have enough money to buy what they want and sometimes they cannot make a full payment regarding college stuff such as textbooks, transport or other things. As I know, some colleges are very expensive, and the fees cost a lot. Students who cannot get a scholarship and make a student loan may fight so hard just to get into a college they dream of because of it they must make sure that they do not have any problems with college.  Next, they will have real experience when working with other people. For me, this is a very good opportunity for them after they graduate because they already have experience and skills. For example, they know how to communicate with people, know how to solve problems, and easily can adapt in any situation. Last but not least, time management is very important. As for me, it is very hard to balance studies and do a part time job because it requires a lot of energy and sometimes you need to sacrifice your sleep. But overall, they can learn how to manage time efficiently and prioritize the important things in life.
