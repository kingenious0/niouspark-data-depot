 
Yes, I'm totally agreed with the statement about smoking should be completely banned at all restaurant in the country. They should banned smoking in the restaurant because smoking will make restaurant environment become unhealthy and dangerous for people in the restaurant. Smoking will produced carbon dioxide from the smoke of tobaccos and spread out to people in the restaurant badly.Pasive smoker will get more side effect compared to real smoker because the smoke will contribute a lot of diseases to them such as lungs cancer, lips become dark and dry and many more side effect from smoking.Furthermore,smoking in the restaurant can cause a problem to the restaurant operation. For example,the restaurant will lacks of customers because smoking can cause people around hard to breath and mostly people hated smoke especially indoor restaurant. Next point is smoking should banned in all restaurant because they are dangerous for baby in the restaurant. Smoking actually proved by health government about dangerous for health especially in the restaurant who had baby as their customer. Parents will avoid their child from eating at the restaurant that had a lot of smoker because they are dangerous to child especially baby.In other perspective is smoking should banned in the restaurant because smoke from tobacco actually can effects the foods at the restaurant become dangerous and poisoning to people .It is because smoke can make food texture become bad and unhealthy when the smoke and foods unite together  from the air .
