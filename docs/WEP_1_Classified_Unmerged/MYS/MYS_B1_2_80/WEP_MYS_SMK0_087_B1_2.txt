I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. These smokers should respect other people who want to eat their food in peace and comfortable atmosphere. The smoke from the cigarettes itself is smelly and annoying. Imagine you are eating and the bad smell from cigarettes comes. It cuts off the mood. Besides, the smoke from cigarettes is dangerous for human health. Smoking has got several health effects on smokers and it harms almost all the organs in the body. Even if the people are not smokers, it can turn bad if they smell the smoke. 87% of lung cancer deaths nowadays are caused by smoking. The smoke can ruin our lungs even if we only smelled it and can expose us to other cancer and health problems. In addition, the smoke from the cigarette is also dangerous for children. Children can be easily exposed to disease so smokers really should be aware of this. They have to realize that they can make others feel uncomfortable and endanger other people's life, thus they need to respect others' rights. The owner of the restaurants and all other premises should ban smoking habits so we can create a better environment for our community.
