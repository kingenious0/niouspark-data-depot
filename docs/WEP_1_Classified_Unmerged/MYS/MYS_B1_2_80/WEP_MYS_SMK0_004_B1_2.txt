Yes, I agree for various reasons. First, health issues. It goes without saying that smoke is harmful for everyone not only the smokers but people around them, the secondary victims. Therefore, smokers have to be consistently reminded by how dangerous it is. If this act was banned completely, they would have no choice but adhere and this would probably efficient to train them to lower their frequency to at least stop smoking while enjoying meals at restaurants. In Malaysia, most people have accepted smoking habit as this seems normal and common to be followed. This is not right and has to be transformed. Secondly, financial issues. Smokers would definitely spend money every single day on cigarettes and this would lead to financial crisis among smokers who earn less which eventually stress them out. Depression due to smoking habit will probably make smokers doing something worse such as committing robbery or taking cheap drugs to feel better and alleviate their stress. Lastly, ban smoking for the sake of healthy environment. The act of smoking in a public area especially restaurants does not look attractive and non-smoking people including pregnant ladies would surely feel uncomfortable. Apart from that, Bronchitis is one of the diseases that caused by smoke and the effort of banning smoking in the restaurants will totally decrease the potential of infection.
