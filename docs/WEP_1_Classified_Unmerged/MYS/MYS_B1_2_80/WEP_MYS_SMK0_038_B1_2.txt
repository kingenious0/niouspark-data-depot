Yes, I totally agree with this statement. Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. We all know, smoking is not good for our health. It give a really bad effection for our body in the future. The smoke from the cigarettes very not good at all for our children especially for the babies. Smoking will affect the heart and it lead to serious heart disease. Once they already have heart disease, they no longer have healthy lungs. it will look bad and dirty in it. They will easily feel difficult to breath. Other than that, their blood vessels will be under pressure. Another point why smoking should be banned at all restaurant in the world is, the smell of rotten cigarette smoke can make people angry and feel uneasy while they enjoy their free time. They can't eat peacefully with their family and friends if they keep smelling something bad and smoky. Otherwise, smoking at the public also can be catogarized as vandalism. The reason is, after they already finished smoking, they will definitely just throw it away all over the place. Being unresponsible by their own action. That's why all the country in this world should banned smoking in the restaurant.
