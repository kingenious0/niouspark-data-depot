 Yes , I'm totally agreed with this statements. Smoking should be banned  at all restaurants across the country. Smoking is a severe health risk, and forcing nonsmokers to breathe in secondhand smoke is unjust. Secondhand smoke has been linked to cancer, heart disease, and other health issues. It is extremely dangerous to youngsters and pregnant women.
There are numerous reasons why smoking in restaurants should be prohibited. For starters, it is harmful to nonsmokers' health. Cancer, heart disease, stroke, lung disease, and other health problems can all be caused by secondhand smoke. It can also raise the chance of neonates dying from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Third, smoking causes fires. Cigarettes are easily ignitable, and smoking in restaurants raises the risk of a fire. Fourth, smoking is inconvenient. Being among smokers can be unpleasant, and it can make it difficult to enjoy a meal.
A smoking ban in restaurants would be a step in the right direction for public health. Nonsmokers would be protected from the negative effects of secondhand smoke, and restaurants would be a more pleasant place to eat.In addition to the health dangers, smoking in restaurants has a significant environmental impact. Cigarette butts contribute significantly to trash and can damage streams and soil. A smoking ban would help to reduce cigarette litter while also improving the environment.
I believe that the benefits of prohibiting smoking in restaurants outweigh the disadvantages. A smoking ban would protect the health of nonsmokers, improve the atmosphere, and make restaurants a more pleasant place to eat. I strongly urge you to support a smoking ban in your city or state.
