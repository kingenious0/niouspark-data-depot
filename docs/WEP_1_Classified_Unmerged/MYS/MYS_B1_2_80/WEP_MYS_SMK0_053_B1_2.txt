Agree, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. As everyone knowledge, everyone should know that smoking in the restaurant with the 'do not smoking' sticker is certainly banned and a person who violated this issue needs to pay the fine. However, despite this statement, there are still a lot of people who ignore the issue because of the lack of common sense. Smoking while other people are eating in the restaurant is a big no because the smell and smoke release from the smoking does make other people uncomfortable. Not to mention the aftereffects to the other people who smell it are more severe than the person who smokes. It is getting more troublesome and annoying for a family with children and baby. As someone who went to the restaurant to enjoy the cuisine alongside with a family, it is very annoying to face these problems because we prioritize our health and expect to have a good dining with a healthy environment. Thus, people with zero common sense that smoking in the dining area should be more aware with other people thought since restaurant is a place to eat. To sum up, every restaurant should prepare a smoking area to prevent uneasiness while a customer eats.
