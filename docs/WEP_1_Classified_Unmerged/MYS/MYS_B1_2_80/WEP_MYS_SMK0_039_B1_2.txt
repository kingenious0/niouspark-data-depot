In my opinion, I agree with the statement above because if some people smoke at the restaurants it will disturb other customer to enjoy their meal. The reason is scent of the cigarettes contain many dangerous and toxic ingredients in that. Moreover, if the nonsmokers inhale the scent of the cigarette it will turn them into passive smoker. Other than that, cigarettes have many disadvantages for people too. The disadvantages are first people will waste their money by buying the cigarette because they are addicted since cigarettes have nicotine in it to make the smoker become more addicted. Next, cigarette will cause disease like lung cancer, miscarriage for the pregnant woman and heart diseases since it have carbon dioxide and monoxide. Besides, the cigarette can causes pollution because cigarette cannot easily dispose and some of the unresponsiblity people throw the cigarette stub anywhere. The government should take action immediately to keep the people live in healthy and clean country environment. Besides, the government will spend no subsidy to import the cigarette since cigarette is ban in the country. The government can set up fine and compound to people that smoke in this country in order to keep the people free from nicotine according to the disease that increase year by year because of cigarette.
