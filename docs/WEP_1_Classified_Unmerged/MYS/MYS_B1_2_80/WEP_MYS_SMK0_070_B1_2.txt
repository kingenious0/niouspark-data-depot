  Banning smoking is a controversional topic since many individuals vehemently support it while others reject it. Although it has been around for centuries and is illegal in many nations, public smoking is nevertheless permitted in many others. Personally, I strongly agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant in the country.
Smoking should be banned at all the restaurant because smoking is bad for one's health. Lung cancer is the result, which ultimately results in death. Even while symptoms may not appear right away, it always does.  Active smokers often experience various illnesses like heart issues. The people surrounding the smoker are also impacted in addition to the smoker themselves. Smoking in public spaces should be completely banned because both active and passive smokers might become unwell.
Second, smoking is an addiction that affects people who do not smoke. Anything that develops into an addiction is by no means secure and it usually spreads swiftly. Influences from peer and workplace groups are frequently present when smoking habits are formed. When one spends a lot of time around smokers, it is relatively simple to start smoking. 
Finally, being around smokers makes non-smokers feel extremely agitated. Children, the elderly, and those who are pregnant find it challenging to acclimatise to a smoke-filled environment. It aggravates non-smokers of all ages. Public smoking need to be outlawed because it significantly increases irritability.
In conclusion, it has been suggested that the smoking prohibition in restaurants may encourage smokers to cut back on their usage. People might not be as driven to quit smoking if it were permitted to smoke in public places as they would be if it were prohibited.
