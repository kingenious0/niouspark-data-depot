"  How do college students gain their income? In my opinion, most of them get money from their parents. This might pressure their parents because of the daily expenses and their school fees. Therefore, I agree that it is important for college students to have a part time job.
  First, working part time helps students to earn extra income. It allows students to be more independent financially and in their daily life. This can enlighten the burden of their family and allow students to buy things that they like. Students who work part time will have a better time management and can manage their own stuffs.
  Besides that, students can also gain work experience. They can learn how to socialize with people in a proper manner. They will be more polite and learn how to communicate with people from different backgrounds. Students are able to learn extra skills from the working environment.
  Other than that, college students can enrich their resume for future use. They have a higher chance to gain a job because they already have working experience which can enlighten the burden of a company. Basic skills do not need to be taught to those who have work experience.
  As a conclusion, having a part time job as a college student is a bit hard because they need to complete the assignments given but the benefits are clearly seen.
