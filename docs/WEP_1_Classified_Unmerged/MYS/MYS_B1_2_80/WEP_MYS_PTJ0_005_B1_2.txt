I agree with the statement that student should have a part-time job. In this technology eras, student should have a part time job to support their cost living or at least support their desire. There are few benefits that student can achieve from having a part time job. Student can learn how to be a responsible person. To do part time job, they need to do the work by their own without any helped from others. They also will realise that the mistake they do will effect others people life and be responsible for it. They need to be trained to live in reality, that everything have the conscious. Other than that, student will know about how hard their parents need to work just to raise them. Moreover in this centuries, everything needs money and the price for it is not cheap. In this context, they will more appreciate their parents. They will know more about hard work and appreciate every penny and spending it wisely. Moreover, by do part time job, student can learn how to manage their time. This skill is really important in this time as people need to divide their time fairly with their carrier and personal live. By poor time management can lead people into several mental health such as anxiety, depression and others. Last but not least, the difference between student that do part time job with regular students is they manage to get new experience and  new life skill. They can a learn a lot about how people in industry work. This is a huge benefit for them after they graduated from their studies.
