I absolutely agree if this rule is implemented in the country. Smokers have to realize that not all people are used to being exposed with cigarettes smoke and not all non-smokers can stand the irritating smell of tobacco as the smoke tends to linger on clothes and hairs. Most of non-smokers are usually not comfortable when they are surrounded with smokers, as smoking not only leads to health problems for the smoker, but also for people close by. Smokers' decision to smoke in public places especially restaurants is such a selfish decision and it is simply not fair to impose harm upon another person. Furthermore, restaurants are usually the place for people to gather around in wide range of age, from babies to elderly person. Babies and elderly person are prone to get life threatening diseases due to the cigarette smoke as their immune system is weak. In addition, smoking in front of children may be a bad influence on them. Children tend to imitate what they see and are easily influenced by the action. The children will also perceive that smoking may be a good thing to do but it is not. Hence, the government needs to stricten the law regarding smoking in restaurants to guarantee a better environment.
