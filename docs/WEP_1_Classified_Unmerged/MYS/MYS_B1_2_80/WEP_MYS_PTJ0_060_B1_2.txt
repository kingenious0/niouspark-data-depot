 Part-time job is side work student do during their studying include full-time student or part-time student. I disagree that college students to have a part-time job because student will get tiredness, have burnout mental health and distract their study. Some students can cope with their consequences in their future especially to their study when do part-time job and otherwise some student cannot cope with that.
Firstly, part-time its not important for college student because the student will get tiredness. Student need to give full commitment to their study especially to finish their assignments and group project meanwhile student also need to spent their time to do part-time job. Student will did not get enough rest and time for themselves that student need to spent their free time to do part-time job. For example, in the morning until evening they need to attend their class and at night they need to do a part-time job in restaurant and after that they need to finish their assignments. Hence, they will not get enough sleep and feel tiredness for the next day.
Secondly, part-time its not important that can cause burnout mental health for students. Their mental health is not all ready for under stress pressure when do part-time job and studying. To illustrate, students get mental exhausted that they get stress in studying when have a lot assignment to do especially near the dateline to send and in job place they get scold by the owner when do a mistake.
Thirdly, part-time job will distract college student studying. They have to manage their time to attend class and do assignments and to do part-time job. For example, college student did not get enough time to finish their assignments and also do the revision more because when weekend they do a part-time job.
