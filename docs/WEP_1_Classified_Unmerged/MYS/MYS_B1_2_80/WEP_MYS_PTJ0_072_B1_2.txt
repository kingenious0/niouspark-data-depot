I do not agree that part-time work is important for college students. Part-time work is a job done after class and is paid according to working hours.  Most of the part-time jobs offered to university students are restaurant jobs. In my opinion, college students don't have to have a part-time job because not all students can divide their time well. For example, there are college students who are unable to submit assignments at the specified time due to lack of time due to work. Based on my experience as well, during the diploma, some students work part-time, so when we want to discuss the assignment, the students cannot get involved because they are working.  As students, we should show a good attitude even more when in groups. Part-time work is very tiring for me because there is not enough time for rest.  Like me, I will do assignments at night from 9 to 12, if I work part-time, I don't have time to manage myself and manage learning.  Part-time work can also increase the level of stress for students because the work environment is different from the learning environment.  So it causes a student to have pressure.  In conclusion, part-time work for college students is not important because it can lead to a lack of time, less rest time, and an increased level of stress.
