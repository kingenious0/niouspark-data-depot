 Yes, I partially agree with the statement smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Firstly, smoking is a habit that harm to our body and will cause health problem such as lung cancer, and brain cancer. Smoking in a restaurant is a selfish habit that affect the smokers himself and the people in the surroundings. For example, a restaurant usually is a closed area without a good air circulation, if the smokers smoke at the place, the smoke produced by the smoker will release to the air in the restaurant. In this way, the people in the restaurant will inhale the smoke released by the smoker. In fact, the secondary smokers having more critical effect on health compared to the primary smokers. For this reason, the smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. 
But in the perspective of the business of the restaurant, completely banned the smoking will reduce the business and income of the restaurant. For example, if the smoking is prohibited in the restaurant, when the smokers having the urge to smoke, they will go outside the restaurant and smoke. In a long-term effect, the smokers will not tend to go to the restaurant to having their meal and significantly reduce the business and income of the restaurant. 
In short, completely banned smoking at all the restaurants in the country having benefit and disbenefit to public. In my opinion, I partially agree with the statement.
