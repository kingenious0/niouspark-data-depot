"Smoking was never a good habit, and should have never been a habit. Without any hesitation, I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. 

The ultimate reason why smoking should be banned completely at all restaurants in the country is because it brings harm to health. In this context, smoking is dangerous as it causes the smokers to inhale many dangerous substances such as nicotine and tar that might lead to  respiratory disease such as lung cancer. Looking at the wider perspective, smoking does not only bring harm to the smoker primarily, however it damages the health of passive smokers or people who inhale the tobacco's smoke. This is because scientific research shows that passive smokers will receive more side effects of smoking rather than the smoker. For example, when dining in with smokers, people who are prone to have respiratory illness like babies and elderly with asthma can easily be in danger just by breathing in the gasses emitted from smoking, via air transmission. 

	Next, the other reason why smoking should be banned completely in restaurants is to provide great air quality for the customers. A restaurant should be a place with nice ambience, serving great dishes with a clear atmosphere. However, if the restaurant is being polluted with harmful substances in its air, the customers will find it as a disturbance to enjoy the time there. For example, the restaurant will eventually face an air pollution situation that happened because of the bad smoke smell from the smoking habit. Consequently, this air pollution from cigarette smoke will automatically annoy the  other customer that firstly came to enjoy the food. 	"
