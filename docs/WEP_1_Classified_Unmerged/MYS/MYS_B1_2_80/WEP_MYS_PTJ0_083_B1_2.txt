Yes, I agree with the statement that it is important for college student to have a part-time job because it can give more benefits to us. I know that there is another perspective of student about this but for me it is very important because they can earn extra money. Sometimes being a student need more money to buy basic essential and some of their parent can't afford to give them pocket money but when do a part-time job they do not worry anymore about that because they can use the money to buy anything that they need and use it for college and study fees. Usually, students feel embarrassed to ask some money and don't want to be a burden for their parent. This way can help student to earn more money so that they can survive their daily life in college. Another benefit is student can get more and new experience while working, they can explore and learn how to do something and be more discipline. This will add in their knowledge how to be a confident person and how discipline in manage their time. Student also can work in a team which is do the task together and can give a cooperation for each other. They can easily apply job when they finished their study because as we know there is a lot industry out there want a job experience while want to apply those jobs. Last but not least studying while working is not a bad thing that they need to do because it can give more advantages for them but you need to make a right decision same as your thought.
