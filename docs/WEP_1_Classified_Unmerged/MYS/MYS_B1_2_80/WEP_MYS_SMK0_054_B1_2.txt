I am very agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. This is because second-hand smoke could be dangerous to restaurant clients who do not smoke, and to wait staff who must be exposed to the smoke. Second-hand smoke could be externality that makes dining unpleasant for nearby non-smokers. This is definitely true for me, I would avoid restaurants that allowed the smoking for no reason. It can also male me uncomfortable when someone smoke near me because I hate the smokes very much. Smokes are very dangerous for non-smokers especially people who have heart disease and the babies who have asthma. The smoke can causes difficult breathing and can lead to fatality. The restaurants authority can ask the smokers to smoke outside the restaurant to make other customers comfortable when enjoying their meals at the restaurant. Some argue that small businesses may suffer. But smoking costs employers money, as a smoky environment increases the rate of absenteeism among staff and decrease productivity. There is a price to pay, but in the long run ban would be in everyones best interest. What it all boils to is the fact that smokers have the right to smoke. Yes, it may bother some, but that is what a democratic society is about compromise. Under existing laws, restaurant must provide smoking and non-smoking sections. I think that is the best solution.
