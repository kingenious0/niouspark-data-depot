I agree it is important for college students to have a part-time job. The students can not rely on their parents 100% as their families do have other things to take care of too. As we know, not all the students come from wealthy families, some of them came from small and poor families so the students need to have their income to ensure survival at the universities or colleges. I agree with the statement because there are a lot of things that students need to pay for and use money. For example, their daily meals can cost them up to RM20 for one day. If the students came from a far state and rarely went home, their cost of food can reach out to RM600 per month. That is a lot. They also need to pay for the rent if they rented a house because not all the students got the hostel. House rental prices can also reach up to RM300 monthly. Besides, the cost of their assignments and projects also needs to be borne by themselves. Besides, they need to buy materials to study such as books and dictionaries. Those materials are expensive. Not only that, they also need to pay for transportation if they lived outside the campus. For instance, the students mostly use the service of Grab and Uber to go to the class if they did not bring their vehicles. The tickets for students to go back home are also expensive nowadays. That is all the reason why students should have a part–time job. Generally, it is to provide the students themselves more oriented life and comfortable life at the universities or even at the colleges and to avoid the students from being stressed out when it comes to money.
