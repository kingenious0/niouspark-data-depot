I am totally agreeing for a college student to have a part-time job. In Malaysia, most of the college students are more than 18 years old, which consider adult in law, therefore an adult supposed to be had the ability to taking care of themselves. Not only that, in this fast-paced community having a part time job will ease the students to get into working environment later. Next, I believe that most of the parents of college students are almost reaching retiring age, with part-time job the burden brought to them will reduce especially for those from poor family. Moreover, in JobStreet, MyFututeJob or any job seeker website, for sure there will be a section for you to fill up your working experience. With the extra working experience, your application will have more advantages to be reviewed by the company. Friends and relationship undoubtedly are somethings that everyone need in this community. With this part-time job, the student will be able to learn more friends and able to find those 'true' friends. Nevertheless, having more relationship indirectly benefit someone to be have more chances compare to others. On the other hand, getting in touch with more people will train the student to have a more comprehensive judgement on a new met person. Planning is the basis of everything, if you don't know how the things getting around, it is very hard for you to come out with a good result. Students who have a part-time job will allow them to learn how to plan and adjust between priority, in this case most significantly time management between study and work.
