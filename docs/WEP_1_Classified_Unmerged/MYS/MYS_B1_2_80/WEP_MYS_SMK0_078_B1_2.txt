Yes, I agree with the statement given. In my opinion, it is not appropriate to smoke at any restaurant, as most restaurants do not provide a smoking area. Firstly, smokers tend to smoke inside restaurants, making other people uncomfortable to eat, which is impolite. This is because customers come to restaurants to pay and eat good food, but the smokers are being impolite by disturbing their precious eating time. Secondly, smoking in a restaurant can cause bad health conditions for those who smell the smoke. It is because the restaurant's customers are from a wide range of ages, and it could be an old person or a young child, which is not good for the smokers to smoke as it can cause bad health conditions for them. Thirdly, smoking in restaurants can cause harm to the restaurant's safety. The smoke detector alarms inside the restaurants are sometimes quite sensitive, which can cause the alarm to turn on if they detect any smoke inside the restaurants. This is causing harm not only for the customers but for the restaurant staff too. In a nutshell, I think that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country, as it has way too many disadvantages.
