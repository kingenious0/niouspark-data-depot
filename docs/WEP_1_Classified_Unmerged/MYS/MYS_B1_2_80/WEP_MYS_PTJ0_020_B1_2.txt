I strongly disagree with the statement of  it is important for college students to have a part-time job.  To emphasise the word of  important , I believe it totally depends on an individual's financial and time capability. If we really perceive that it is important for college students to have the part time job, then, the higher education institution has failed in planning its curriculum where the industry training course should be the main core or priority for the students to gain knowledge and experience in the working field. First and foremost, college life only lasts three to four years. If the students focus on seeking part time jobs to gain extra money, it will distract their concentration in having a memorable learning journey as a student. It is totally normal for students these days to have their own business as side income. The Malaysian society also encouraged students to generate their own income while studying full time. Nevertheless, have we ever thought of work-play balance in the education context? If working part time is vital for students, it indirectly adds another burden for students to study while juggling with part time jobs. It is undeniable that part time jobs give a lot of exposure for students to enhance their communication and management skill, however, it should be an option for college students. To conclude, I believe a student should always prioritise their physical and mental health regardless in whatever they are doing.
