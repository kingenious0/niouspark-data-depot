"           College students often face various challenges, especially when it comes to financial problems due to their commitment to fulfil such as food, assignment (projects), transportation, etc. Hence, this essay entails the importance of students doing part-time jobs.
           Firstly, having a part-time job enable students to gain experience in a real-life situation. This is because they need to face various people's behaviour rather than focus on studying only. This kind of experience can teach them to become more confident and also improve their social skills. For instance, students who become cashiers at convenience stores gain a new experience to deal with customers politely and wisely. Thus, part-time jobs lead students to enrich their experience in such situations.
          Furthermore, students can utilise their income to good use once they have part-time jobs. Their source of income may help them to pay for their college fee, buy gadgets to help them do assignments and so on. If they just depend on their parents' money, they cannot learn to become independent and know the struggle to obtain it. To illustrate, students who do part-time jobs tend to use the money to buy their necessities and are more diligent to work as they know how difficult to gain it. So, a part-time job is really important to let the students use their income wisely.
         In conclusion, students may gain a plethora of benefits by having part-time jobs. This is because they can gain experience and also make them benefit their income in good ways. Therefore, the writer thinks that it is essential for students to have part-time jobs to become more independent and confident."
