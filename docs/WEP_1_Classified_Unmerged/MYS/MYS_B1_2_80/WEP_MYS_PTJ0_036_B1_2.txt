 As we all know, a part time job is where we do additional work after working hours of our main occupation. Nowadays, part time jobs are becoming popular not only among adults, but also teenagers. For them, there is no problem doing a part time job as long as people know how to manage their time wisely between working and studying. For the statement, I agree that it is important for college students to have a part time job. There are a few reasons why I agree with the statement. Firstly, college students who have a part time job will help their parents by lowering the burden. They will pay their education fee and buy everything they want by themselves. Not only that, their parents do not have to worry about the money pocket every month as the student already had their side income. So it is important to have a part time job.

Secondly, students will get experience from their part time job. They can get to know how to do the job and solve the problem in a workplace. With these experiences, they can apply for jobs that will help them in the future.

Lastly, a part time job can help students to improve their soft skills in and outside the class. Students will be experts in communication skills as they use to deal with people in the workplace. Moreover, they also get to know about time management so that they can improve their mistakes in timing.

The conclusion is, a part time job is not something that will cause bad for college students. There are many benefits that can be proven in many ways. Despite that, it also will bring the bad sides of a part time job if we do not know how to handle it.
