           Nowadays, many students have jobs while attending college for various reasons. Balancing work and college can be challenging for students, but many students manage to deal with it. I absolutely agree that it is important for college students to have part-time job. I said so because having part-time job offers a lot of advantages for students including earning extra money, gaining work experience and increase soft skills. 

          First and foremost, working part-time in college provide the obvious benefit of earning extra money. Many students rely on part-time jobs to cover their college and daily expenses. When having a part-time job, it also allows student to buy extra stuffs, go out and have fun with their friends. 

          In addition, part-time job gives students work experience. I believe that when people graduates, some organizations expect us to have the basics of professionalism. For instance, office management student should know how to use the fax machine and handle phone calls. Employers will likely to hire a person who greatly experience doing work things related rather than a person who academically great alone. 

          Moreover, students who fulfil their leisure time with part-time jobs can enhance their soft skills. This is because we cannot learn it out of a book without practising or experience it. I believe that the soft skills like communication, professionalism, punctual in everything are something for a person to actually do it.

          To sum up, it is not impossible for students to experience new thing. Working while going to college literally has its own bright side which are earning extra money, gaining work experience and enhance soft skills.
