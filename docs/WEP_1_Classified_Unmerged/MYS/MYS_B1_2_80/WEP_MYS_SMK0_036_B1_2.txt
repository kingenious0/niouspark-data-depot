 Smoking is a negative activity that is not unfamiliar in our county. Despite that, it had been a normal habit among the public, especially in men. Some people strongly agree that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. Same goes for me, I agree that smoking should be banned especially in a place that is crowded with many people. There are a few reasons why I stand with my opinion. Firstly, smoking will increase the data of health issues in our country. In the restaurant, there are many people which consist of women and children which will harm their body and cause diseases like respiratory problems and lung disease that may lead to death. Therefore, smoking should be banned in our country.  

Next is smoking will cause discomfort and annoyance to customers in the restaurant. Smokers will take their freedom to enjoy the food while having to smell the unhealthy smoke from cigarettes. The unpleasant feeling can make them feel threatened about their health.

The last one is, smoking might cause problems for the business. This is because it will lead to arguments between smoker and non-smoker. Not only that, the workers also will not be satisfied working in an unhealthy environment. If this continues, the restaurant will have to face bankruptcy due to losing customers and workers.

In a nutshell, we can see smoking has some negative effects toward people in our country. Although it is not easy to handle this problem, everyone in the country has to be responsible in preventing our health from any diseases. Thus, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country.
