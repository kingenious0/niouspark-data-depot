In my opinion, I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking is a bad habit that people find it as a way to release their stress. It is prevalent in the world disregarding of the age, gender and races. Smoking will contribute to both short-term and long-term effects which are harmful to human's health. This is because the ignition of cigarettes will release nicotine which is the main contributor of lung cancer. From the research, it is found that those who inhales the smokes has a higher chance of diagnosing lung cancer compared to the smokers. Therefore, smoking at a public space such as restaurant is an irresponsible and selfish behaviour. Smoking at public area not only affects people's health, but also spoils their moods. Especially to those who have respiratory illnesses such as asthma, their diseases might be triggered once they inhaled the smokes from cigarette. Besides, this behaviour can affect the cleanliness around the restaurant since the smokers will abandon the cigarette on the ground without cleaning it. In addition, smoking contributes to environmental problems such as air pollution. During smoking, some harmful gases will release to the atmosphere which further increase the air pollution index (API) of the country. In summary,  smoking at all the restaurants should be banned as it only brings disadvantages to the public.
