 In this modern world, everyone needs money, especially youth. As we know, they need to earn more money to buy the things that they like, but their parents or family members are unable to provide them with the desired things. So, from my point of view, I strongly agree that university students should do part time jobs when they are studying. 
Firstly, doing a part time job helps them become more independent. This is because the time for studying at the university is flexible. Students can manage their time well while working a part time job. In addition, doing part time jobs allows them to gain more experience that will help them in the future. Besides that, they can manage their money well. The money that they earn can be their income or their living expenses. They do not need to rely on their parents. By doing so, they can lighten their parents' burden. They can also enjoy happiness when they spend their own money without asking for money from their parents. Moreover, they can also make new friends by doing part time jobs. Knowing more friends is good for their future. When they need help, maybe friends can give them suggestions or opinions. This way can foster their growth and become more mature. 
In conclusion, the benefits of university students doing part time jobs are many for both themselves and their families. They can train for their own financial independence and responsibility, gain valuable work experience, and develop important time management skills.
