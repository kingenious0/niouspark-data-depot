I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. As we know, a cigarette is made of tobacco and nicotine, and the burning of these chemicals will release a type of toxic gas. Thus, smoking is bad for health and it may cause lung cancer. However, when there are people start to smoke at eating places, it will harm other customers and disturb their eating experience. Smoking will lead to breathing difficulties for other customers as they can be called the  second smoker . They will inhale the toxic gas and then further damage their lungs more severely than the first smoker. In the restaurants, there will be also kids having their meals over there. Even if the adults cannot withstand the smoke from the burning cigarette, their kids have a lower immunity towards cigarette smoke. The kids will be infected by lung diseases from a young age which inhibits their growth. A restaurant is a place where we have our meals, not a place for smoking. The government has already provided smoking areas for smokers, however, there are still some irresponsible people who intend to smoke in the prohibited area. In conclusion, smoking should not be carried out in an open area with crowded people as it will harm others' health.
