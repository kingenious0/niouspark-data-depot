I totally agree with the statement of  smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country . Firstly, smoking kills people and people around them. Secondhand smokers can also get sick easily by just inhaling the smoke. Furthermore, restaurants are public eating places where all humans from various ages and backgrounds gather in an area to enjoy their food. People who have chronic diseases, elderly and babies could probably have difficult time to breathe the oxygen with the smoke around, not to mention healthy people as well. This issue has been debated for various times. It is significant for smokers to acknowledge that there are people that uncomfortable to be around them. Smokers are still allowed to smoke in the designated area. We, as a society respects that smokers need to smoke, and the smoker's community also need to respect that there are only certain places that they can smoke. Mutual understanding is vital in this matter as individual's health is the main priority. To summarise, I hope the government will tighten the law of smoking at the restaurants. Higher penalty should be given to people who failed to abide the law. All in all, smokers should not be permitted to smoke at the dining places, regardless indoor or outdoor.
