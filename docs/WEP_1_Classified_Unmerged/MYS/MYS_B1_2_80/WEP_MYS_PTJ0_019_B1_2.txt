I agree that it is college student to have a part-time job. Part-time job is working on a job during studying period such as being a cashier, promoter and many more. This will benefit the student by giving them some extra pocket money while they are studying and not solely depends on their parents for their expenditure. Being independent is a thing that we need to do during our study because we can train ourselves to not just depends on others and try our best to live and survive. Students and also try to value more on the money they get paid as they work their sweat of for a month in order to get paid. Students will also learn on the time management skills as they try to attend work and study at the same time. It is not an easy task to divide the time as efficient as it was before taking any part-time job because some will have to endure the tiredness and also loneliness as they do not have much time to spend on themselves and also others. The fatigue will drain them mentally and physically but does it not worth it? The enjoyment you will have later. However, there are many points of the bright sight rather than the dark side.
