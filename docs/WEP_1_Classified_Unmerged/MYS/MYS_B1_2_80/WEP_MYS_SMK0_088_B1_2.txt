There are still few smokers are acting irresponsibly when they are at restaurants. They insist to keep on smoking for their pleasure and not thinking of other people around them. Undeniably, I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. This immoral act should be restricted because it causes hygienic issues and health issues. Firstly, smoking at public places such as restaurant is very inappropriate as the restaurant serves food and drinks. Imagine debris in the air and the smelly smoke that comes from the cigarettes could get into our food and drinks. Moreover, smokers tend to throw away the cigarette's butts on the floor. Correspondingly, the floor will be dirty causes by them. Secondly, smoking in crowded environment, especially at restaurants could harm people around them. The emission of the smoke could be inhaled by poeple near them and the smoke could cause short of breath. It is more harmful to babies, kids, elderly and people with chronic diseases such as asthma. From experience of mine, whenever I unaccidentally inhaled the smoke, I felt like I was in shortness of breath for a while as the smoke smells chemically harmful and I could not stand the smell of it. As the conclusion, the government should not let smokers smoke at restaurants. Even though there are some people do not abide by the law, the should be sued for keep harming other people and being selfish. This is the only way to stop them from being an irresponsible citizens to the country.
