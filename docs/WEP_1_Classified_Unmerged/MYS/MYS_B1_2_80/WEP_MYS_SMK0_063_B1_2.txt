I agree with this statement. As everyone knows that cigarette smoke can give bad effects on body health not just for smokers but also for the people surrounding them which is their family, especially pregnant women, babies, and kids. As we know restaurant is a public places that a family come to have meals so completely banning smoking activities is such a great idea to prevent harm and reduce risk of the second-hand smoke. Besides, the bad effects of second-hand smoke are premature babies, asthma, and many more. People surrounding who do not smoke also preferred to be in a restaurant that is free from people smoking because they did not feel comfortable having a meal in the surrounding that fill with smoke. People who smoke maybe feel comfortable with them smoking and did not give them any bad effects immediately. Thus, cigarettes contain a lot of nicotine which is bad for the lungs and can make many more diseases in the smoker's body. Lastly, it is a good thing to permanently banned smoking at restaurants because it gives all negative effects on all the people in the restaurants and we want to have a healthy society so we can at least prevent unwanted diseases than cure them.
