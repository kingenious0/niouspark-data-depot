Disagree, it is not important for a college student to have a part time job. First thing first, college students need to be aware of their obligations and responsibility as a student. They need to priority the important things like participating in the classes whether online or offline, completing all the assignment and exercise given by the lecturer, do the revision for the upcoming quiz or test. This is prior to the common problem among the student which is being a 'rider' in a group assignment. Rider is someone who joined as a member in the group but did not participate in the process of finishing the assignment. Not to mention, they mostly progress very slowly with the assignment and end up being a nuisance for other group members. As for my own experience, being in the same group with the part time job's students affected with a bad communication because it is very hard to reach them prior to their work life. Apparently, most of them are working in a business online with flexible hours but still cannot manage to participate in both classes and assignment submissions. For my own research among my peers, they eventually lost interest in continuing the study through to the hard time in handling both things at the same time and prioritizing works because of the financial problems. In a nutshell, If a student insists on taking a part time job, they eventually have a hard time in maintaining both classes and work that lead to have a problem in focusing on the lecture due to the lack of rest and ended with a bad relationship with the classmates.
