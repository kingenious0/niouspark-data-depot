 I agree with the importance of college students having a part-time job. Students who come from low-income background must work hard to get the money to pay priority expenses. They will not burden their parents to pay the college fee, education fees, or daily expenses during study. The part-time job college student could do, is part-time food delivery. While doing food delivery, students could get tips from the customer who order the food that does not want the balance or maybe sympathy with a rider. College students also can be a part-time tuition teacher. From there, they also can improve their communication and teaching skills. College students from Business programme can also make money by doing small business. Selling the product has low cost for starting. For example, selling hot-dog with white bread. Student gains the profit even not many they expected. It's also can improve students' business skills and how to interact with customers.  Their parents will feel proud of them that they work hard to get the money they need even with a lot of assignments and exam around the corner. In conclusion, college students should have a part-time job for them reduce their burden with the current unstable economy.
