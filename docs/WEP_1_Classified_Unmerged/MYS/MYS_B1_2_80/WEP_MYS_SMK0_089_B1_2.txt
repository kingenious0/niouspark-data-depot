 Nowadays, we can see anywhere there are people living their lives with cigarettes and not realising the harm it does to their health. Whether it's regular cigarettes or e-cigarettes, Both of these cigarettes have a lot of disadvantages for our human body. In my opinion, I strongly agree that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. 



First, obviously, the harmful effects of smoking include lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory issues. Moreover, both cigarrettes contain more chemical substances, one of which is nicotine, which can lead to addiction. Smoking in restaurants affects not only the smokers themselves but also the health of non-smokers. For instance, children, pregnant women, elder people, and more They have been exposed to secondhand smoke. Secondhand smoke has been proven to be more harmful to a person. Therefore, the government should implement a ban on smoking in all restaurants to protect the citizens health and create a healthier environment for all people. Besides that, banning smoking can also protect our environment and prevent pollution from getting worse.



In conclusion, we should take action and try to apply to the government to implement a ban on smoking in restaurants. Indirectly, it can also promote a cleaner and more sustainable environment. It is because we can reduce cigarette litter. Protecting the environment and creating a healthier society are ways to ensure a better future for generations to come.
