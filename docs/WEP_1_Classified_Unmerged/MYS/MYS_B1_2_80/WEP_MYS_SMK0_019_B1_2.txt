I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned in all the restaurants in the country. This should not be a debate at all in the first place, because smoking is a danger and it endangered others life as well. The people who inhale the smoke might as well exposed to chemicals that will degrade their life quality. As much as smoking need to be banned in the restaurant, it is as well need to be band all over the country but it is also a dream made unarchived because it is impossible to be done. The addictive in the cigar make them unable to stop smoking and making this a habit will jeopardize their life and their beloved. There are so many cases reported on the disbenefits of smoking but still people do smoke in order to claim the relaxation they will get, the momentarily satisfaction that will eventually begone when their cigar burned to ashes. Smoking in the restaurant is not an option to make. They should control themselves from exhibiting danger and discomfort to the public as most of the people cannot stand the smell of the cigar they smoke and exhale. Why would people do that? Some sense needed to be knocked into them, such as giving compound for those who do so which may include penalty for them for breaking others comfort zone and endangering their life to be exposed carcinogen and so much chemicals that may put our precious life in danger. To conclude, smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants in the country.
