 I could not agree more on this, smoking should be completely and utterly banned at all the restaurants in the country, even bistros or hawker stalls. First of all, it should be clear by now, to almost everyone, the hazardous effect of smoking. Smoking can seriously damage the airway of the human body. Many heavy smokers were found to have a narrower C column (the airway in the throat area) compared to non-smokers. This increases the risk of choking whenever particles accidentally enter the pathway. The alveolus that were damaged work with less efficiency, resulting in insufficient oxygen and excess amounts of carbon hydroxide and carbon monoxide which cause diseases such as bronchitis and lung cancer. What is even more pressing is that these hazardous health effects are even more serious in the case of individuals who are exposed to second-hand smoke compared to that of first-hand smokers. It is unethical and immoral to jeopardize one's and others' greatest assets bestowed by the heavens to us – our body.
	Next, it is unethical to smoke in the restaurant because this not only ruins the savory of customers towards the food but also makes one lose the appetite to eat anything at all. The smell of smoke lingering in the air upsets the nose of customers who are trying to breathe in the fragrance from the food. It feels like someone poured water onto the sandcastle that you or someone else had just built. It is incredibly infuriating and frustrating. Negative emotions will well up within one person. Then, some even lose their appetite the moment they walk into the restaurant only to smell the burning tobacco. This makes restaurants lose customers and creates a bad reputation and image for themselves, in the long run, no doubt it will suffer losses financially.
