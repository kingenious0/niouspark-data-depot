Yes, I agree. Having a part time job can be a big help for students to pay for their college fees and expenses. Students can find a part time job that has flexible working time so that they can balance their work and studies. For instance, they can build up an online shop on the shopping applications and sell goods on it. They can also use up their creativity to make handmade stuff such as keychains, bags, stickers and so on. Then, they can promote their businesses on the internet to increase engagement and attract customers. Other than that, students can apply for a part time job and work physically such as being a cashier at the market on the weekends. They should discuss the available working hours with their employer so that they will not clash with their classes. Thus, students need to have a great sense of time management if they want to have a part time job. Therefore, having a part time job is important for college students as it gives them a side income that can help ease their burden while studying. The side income can ensure that they will have enough money to buy food, pay for fees or any emergency cases.
