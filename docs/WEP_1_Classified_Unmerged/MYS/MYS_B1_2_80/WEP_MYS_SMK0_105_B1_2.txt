This essay will be focused on the topic smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. As a party (member) to the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), Malaysia is required to implement provisions based on scientific evidence that have successfully achieved the goals of many countries to protect everyone from being exposed to the dangers of cigarette smoke in public places. In addition to protecting everyone from exposure to cigarette smoke, reducing the use of tobacco products, and preventing babies, children, and teenagers from being exposed to smoking habits that may encourage them to try and become tobacco product users, smoking is not permitted in public places. An official government circular outlawing smoking in all government buildings served as the impetus for the smoking ban. The majority of public officials would have given up smoking if they all followed this rule. The Tobacco Products Control Regulations of 2004 (PPKHT 2004) were amended on January 1, 2019, and as a result, smoking is now prohibited in all eateries and locations serving food. This is a crucial issue since, as is generally known, people of all ages and backgrounds frequent restaurants. Numerous damages are also caused by smoking and breathing in cigarette smoke. For instance, it contributes to a number of illnesses (heart attacks, breathing problems, etc.). From an economic perspective, this is an unnecessary or wasteful budget expenditure. So, it's important that we ban smoking in all restaurants in Malaysia.
