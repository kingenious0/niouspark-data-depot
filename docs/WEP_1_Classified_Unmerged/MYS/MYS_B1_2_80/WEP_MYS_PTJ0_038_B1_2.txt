Yes, I agree with that statement. It's important for college students to have a part-time job as their side income. As a university students, we know that our university bills and fees is not cheap. it's way more too expensive than we expected. And it's not easy to put all the responsibility on our parents to pay all the fees by themselve. We know they also have their own hard time. As a child, we know what the right things we need to do. other than that, we know part-time job really give them a good experience such as, they can improve their communication skills, teamwork job, time management and make a new friends. By the amazing experience they gained, they can use it for their job's interview in the future. Effective time management really important for college students. They can practice it from there. Practice how to manage time properly without doing any mistake. For other reason why I really recommended college students to have a part-time job is they can make a saving for their future life. To avoid them from bankrupt in the future, they can create their own saving from now. As we all know, backup planning is really important no matter how old are you. Before something bad happen in the future, better they make a good preparation so that they can easily handle the situation without feeling restless.
