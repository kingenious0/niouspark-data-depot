I disagree with this statement. This is because first if the students do a part-time job in their semester study they will not focus on their studies and it will make arises problems for their friends to do assignment jobs as well because the students that work will not make it to the group study to discuss the group projects and did not have any contributes to the group. This happens because to work as part-time workers have their own schedules that they need to follow. Also, if the students have class in the morning and they work in the evening till night they did not have enough rest to the body and it will make them feel burned out to start the day. Furthermore, they will always miss out on the assignments they need to do or any quizzes or tests they need to take and it will affect their carry marks and finals exams too if they did not score for the finals. If the students have any financial issues, they can issue the problems to their academic advisor and your academic advisor will give the advice for the best solutions you can take.  Sure, students can work part-time jobs but not on the semester's ongoing but on the semester break.
