Yes, I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. This is because smoking not only produces harmful substances to the restaurant's environment but also it will affect the other customer's experiences in the restaurant. For your information, cigarette smoke contains harmful substances that can cause harm to our health such as nicotine, tar, carcinogenic compound, carbon monoxide, etc. When someone smoke in restaurant, it will produce white coloured vapor that consist of carcinogenic compound and carbon monoxide that may be absorbed by other people in the restaurant. The smoke that consists of carbon monoxide and other harmful substances may cause health issue for other people around the smoker as well such as lung problem, asthma, and also other lung problem. Research stated that people who absorbed the smoke released from the smoker has high probability of getting health problem such as lung cancer when compared to the smoker itself. This had proven that smoking can not only harm smoker itself but also the people around him. Furthermore, smoking will produce unpleasant smell that may affect other people's eating experiences in the restaurant. The unpleasant smell may cause the customer to feel uncomfortable when having their food in the restaurant and eventually caused the customer having a bad image about the restaurant.
