I am fully agreeing that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking is a bad habit that not only brings harm to the one that smoke but also causing pollution to the environment and bring negative effects to people around him. In some restaurants, they have already banned smoking as it will affects the other customers in the restaurant. When someone is smoking, it will produce a pungent smell which affect the taste of the food and also the dining mood of the customers. Apart from that, the smoke also contains harmful substances such as nicotine, tobacco and tar. These substances will not only affect the one who smoke but also people in his surroundings. The worst part is that people who breath in the smoke out from the smokers will gain more harm as the second handed smoke is more toxic. Besides, if someone always smoke in the restaurant, customers will decrease and will not come eventually as no one would like to have their meal in a polluted environment. After some time, the restaurant could also be closed due to the lack of customers. In conclusion, smoking should be banned at all restaurants for the sake of all customers that come to the restaurant.
