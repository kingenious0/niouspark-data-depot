In my opinion, I agree with the statement above because with economic condition in my country right now students must be smart to find their own way to gain more money to keep them survive in their school or university life. It is because some students that live in poor family so that they can`t just hope to gain more pocket money from their parents. Other than that, mostly students may have spend a lot of their money to pay their for study fee, paying for their subject books and also use more money to buy their essentials. Moreover, among students have their own demand like buying make up, some clothes or want to hang out with their friends so that it will spend a lot of money on it. Besides that, there are benefits for the students if they find their own money by working on their own. The benefits are first if they have their own money, they can help their parents by give their parents some money to buy essentials for survived with other family members. Next, it will teach students discipline on how to spend their money wisely since they find the money by their own. Lastly, student can make more saving for the future since they have a lot of money because they are working.
