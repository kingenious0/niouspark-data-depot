Yes, I'm agreed because there are lot benefits to college students when they have part-time job in university. For example, they can be more independent person because students who took part-time job while they have leisure time will contribute them to be more discipline to earn money for their life in university without troubling their parents. Independent students in university life will avoid them from financial problems and they also can earn more money if they manage their schedule wisely and not neglected their studies because of that. Second point is college students also can get job experiences from their part-time jobs and they can learned new things while they work there. For example, students will get new experiences while they do the part-time job such as selling fast food at the cafe. It's also can make them learned how to promote their product, improve their quality and many more. Business experiences important to student to had marketing and selling skills for their survive in university life as student without asking for parents' money. Third point of part-time job become important to college students is they can earned their pocket money to buy their things by their own money. Part-time job is important to college students because mostly students had lot of things they want to buy on their mind but financial become problems to them. From the perspective, student need to take part-time job as their side income to buy whatever they want to buy without asking from their parents.
