I agree with the statement that said,  Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. . There are a lot of reason why smoking should be banned. Firstly. smoking is dangerous for children. Research said,  people who smell someone smoking can get health problem easier than people who smoking . People who smoking is not only make his have health problem, but they also make people surrounding them have health problem. Example of health problem that we can get is, lungs infection. It is a serious health problem. Secondly who smoking should be banned is people will not feel comfortable to eat. For example, people like me don't like people who smoking, when I eat and someone there is smoking, I automatically will stop eating because I really can't smell the smoke. It was very rude because you do not respect other people. Nowadays government have acted to people who smoke in restaurants will get compound, but still there are a lot of people do not take it seriously. The smokers also have the tendecy to dispute with us for not allowing them to smoke. In conclusion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country for good health and have a great life in the future.
