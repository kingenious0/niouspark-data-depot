 I strongly agree with the statement. In my opinion, the main reason for the students goes for part-time job is to earn money for their study fee and for pocket money. Every student comes from different backgrounds, for example the students from a poor family and single parents' family that is lack of money, they might go for part-time jobs to earn money to reduce the burden from their parents. 
Secondly, having a part-time job is a very good chance for the students for practising the soft skills such as time management and communication skill. For example, students having part-time jobs are having lesser time compared to the one with no part-time jobs. In this way, they should plan their time wisely so that they can complete the task and assignment given by the school and catch up to the syllabus taught in the school. Besides that, having part-time jobs such as promoter and waiter, most of the time they are dealing with the customers and need to speak often. In this way, the students having part-time jobs will have more experience on how to speak and handle some critical situations and customers. 
In conclusion, having part-time jobs are beneficial to the students such as earning extra money, sharpening the soft skills. In my opinion, it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
