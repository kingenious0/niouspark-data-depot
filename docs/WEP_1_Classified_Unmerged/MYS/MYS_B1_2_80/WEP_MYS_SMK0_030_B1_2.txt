I disagree with the statement that smoking should be banned at all restaurant in the country. It is because we are living in a democracy environment where everyone has their freedom and right to live their own path. This restriction will only cause chaos and unfairness among the smoking population. Instead, I feel that smoking zone can be set up at every corner of the street to avoid problematic issues. This may resolve the angry voices through peaceful initiatives. Besides, I do not believe that smoking should not be banned at all restaurants can be a cure to inhibit the rising population of smoking groups in the country. Some of the useful approaches will be introducing electronics cigarettes, lowering gum prices and setting up awareness campaign to promote healthy lifestyle. Although the period will be intensively long, I believe that smoking will be eradicated in the long run. Moreover, all the restaurants should also provide clear instruction and warning to the customer on smoking and non smoking zones in the premises. This guideline can be imperative and helpful for non smoking group to avoid the zone easily. On the other hand, some of the people believe that prohibiting smoking can reduce long exposure of secondhand smoke to the employee. This can greatly improve the health quality and overall well-being. However, I believe that employee should have the responsibility to conduct some research on their job choices thoroughly. In short, everyone should decide pro and cons based on their personal preferences.
