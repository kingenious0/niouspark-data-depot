I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking not only bring side effect towards smoker's health but the most vital part is it brings a more serious effect to the secondhand smokers. Dinning area such as restaurant is considered as an open area where all of us will not be covered with mask, thus if there is smoker who is smoking the other customers in the restaurant will be inhaling the toxic gases such as carbon monoxide, nicotine and so on into their lungs which will cause a lung cancer in long term. Next, smoking in restaurants potentially to cause explosion especially for those hot pot restaurant where gas stove is placed on each dining table. The sparkle of the cigarette will easily ignite the gas and explosion will occur in just a second without any action could be done. This action is undeniably risking all the customers' and workers' life in danger. Furthermore, smoking indoor in restaurant will decrease the appetite of other customers due to the unpleasant smell of smoking. The smokes that produced indirectly increases the temperature of the restaurant and bad circulation within the dining area will not be able to allow the customers to enjoy their meal in the restaurant. In conclusion, smoking never bringing a pro to the restaurant therefore it should be banned permanently in the country
