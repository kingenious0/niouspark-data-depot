In my point of view, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. In general, smoking is a bad habit which will influence individual's health. Based on the previous research by World Health Organisation (WHO), smoking can cause to several chronic diseases, such as lung diseases, hypertension, severe heart attack problems and the lists go on. In addition, smoking in public areas will result in health danger to the public as well. This is because people at the surrounding will inhale the air which contain hazardous chemicals such as carbon monoxide and nicotine. With that, public will have higher probability to be affected by those chronic diseases. Therefore, smoking should be completely banned due to the sake of human's health. On the other hand, smoking should be completely banned due to the environmental problem. Most of the smokers tend to discard their leftover cigarettes at every single corner in the restaurants. This irresponsible behaviour will result in the unnecessary trash and affect the cleanliness at the restaurant. Besides, as cigarette is becoming more and more expensive nowadays, some of the smokers may not be able to afford with it and smoking is becoming a burden for them. Thus, smoking should be banned completely at all the restaurants in the country and even around the world in the future due to its disadvantages.
