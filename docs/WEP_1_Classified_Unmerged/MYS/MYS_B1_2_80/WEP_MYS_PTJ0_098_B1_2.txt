      Nowadays college students seem to be the busiest person. College students normally will have a lot of things to manage that includes studies, family, financial issues and social activities. Some of them even prefer to work for a part-time job. A part-time job is a form of work that enables a person to work for a limited time. It is important for college students to have part-time jobs. I agree with this statement as I believe working as a part-timer helps students financially, gain experience and improve their social skills.
     First of all, part-time jobs help college students financially. By working as part-timers college students do not have to depend on their parents for expenses and they cannot manage it on their own. For instance, college students can pay their tuition fees, books and accommodation. At last, college students will learn the value of money at a young age.
     Furthermore, working as a part-timer help college students to gain work experience. They can learn the important skills needed in a workplace such as responsibility, teamwork, time management and communication skills. They can learn the way to fit into a community and work together. These skills are important to create a better environment at working place. 
     Moreover, having a part-time job helps college students to improve their social skills. Some of the students are shy and introverted. By working they can interact with one another and improve their social skills. This skill is important to mix with a diverse group of people and also in a professional setting.
     In conclusion, as a college student, working as a part-timer has its benefits such as being financially stable, gaining work experience and improving social skills.
