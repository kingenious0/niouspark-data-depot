 I agree with the statement above that having a part-time job is important for college students. A part-time job is one that is done only half the time. This part-time job can be done when students have free time and need to divide their study and work time effectively. There are various benefits for students such as the they can earn extra pocket money, learn how to manage money, and develop interpersonal skills.
The first reason I agree with that statement is students can earn extra pocket money. Students require a lot of money while at university to pay fees, buy daily necessities, food, and transportation which can become costly. As a result, part-time work can assist students in managing all of their responsibilities without relying on their parents. As a result, students can have their own pocket money by working part-time.
Secondly, I want to emphasise that students can learn to manage their money. Students who have earned money by working will be extra cautious to not waste it. For example, they will create a budget before purchasing something. Thus, this part-time job will make them more aware of their financial situation.
Finally, students can improve their interpersonal skills. You will gain communication skills from working a part-time job with people from various backgrounds, which will force you to be aware of cultural differences at work. For example, students will attempt to communicate with their colleagues in order to strengthen their bonds at work. This shows, a part-time job can help you to develop interpersonal skills.
To sum up, having a part-time job provides students with numerous benefits such as earn extra pocket money, learn to manage money, and the develop interpersonal skills. Students should manage their time wisely in order to avoid having their studies and work interrupted.
