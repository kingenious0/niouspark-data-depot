 	As a teenager in this country, in my opinion, I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. From my knowledge, smoking does not bring any benefits to the consumers, maybe just one, it helps a person's mind to relax and release stress. However, there are many ways to help with releasing stress and relaxing the mind, smoking should not be the priority for a person to choose as it brings critical damage to their lungs, and it is not money-friendly as it is highly expensive. Cigarettes contain nicotine that stimulates people to be addicted to smoking, as it could be considered a drug that harms people's health. Other than that, smoking releases secondary smoke that is even more toxic than the original smoke the person consumes. This is the main reason why smoking should be banned at all restaurants as it harms not only the consumers but the people around them. In a restaurant, there will be a lot of people including children and elders. The youngster and the elders' immune systems are more likely to be weaker than a normal adult and this toxic smoke could critically harm their health. Restaurants should be a place where all the consumers take their meals happily and peacefully. However, smoking releases a bad odour to the surrounding. I am sure that this odour will disgust those who do not smoke, and it is most likely to affect their mood during eating their meals. So, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country.
