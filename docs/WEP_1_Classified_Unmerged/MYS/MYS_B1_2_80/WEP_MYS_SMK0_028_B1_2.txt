I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. As everyone know, smoking brings a lot of disadvantages to one's health and it will affects the others' health as well. Imaging that you are going out with friends to have a dinner in a restaurant, you are having a good time with your friends during the dinner, and the smokes coming from the table beside you are ruining the moment, you start to cough, and the taste of the food is affected by the smoke. This situation is happening at most of the restaurants in Malaysia, even there is a sign written that 'smoking is prohibited in this area'. The smokers themselves do not really care about the others, and some will be offensive and started to talk aggressively while people around them are requesting on stop smoking. Smokers are addicted to the nicotine and other drugs inside the smoke, and they cannot really stop themselves from smoking. Hence, the enforcement on banning smoking at all restaurants in Malaysia can be the first step to reduce the dosage of the smoke taken by the smokers, and this can reduce the exposure of the second-hand smoke to the public.
