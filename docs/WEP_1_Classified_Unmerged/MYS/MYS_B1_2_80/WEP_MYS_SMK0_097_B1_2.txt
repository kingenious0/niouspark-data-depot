         Smoking has become a norm today as not many actions would be taken if people smoked in public places. Many would argue that smoking wouldn't have many impacts on the smokers' health or even the people around them. They may say that if it impacts that much, people will instantly die the first three months they smoke. However, it should be avoided at an early stage to prevent any health risks towards the smokers or the people around them. I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country as it would affect people's health and the restaurants' food quality.
      Firstly, some smokers would disagree that smoking affects people's health as it doesn't happen instantly. However, they do not know that it could kill non-smokers due to the air they breathe surround them. This has greatly affected people with asthma and high risk of lung cancer. Studies have also shown that many people have died because of tobacco smoking and some of them aren't even smokers. This is because the air that is breathed by non-smokers contains carcinogenic chemicals which could lead to cancer and other health risks. To conclude, smoking should be banned in restaurants as it affects people's health.
      Secondly, some may have no idea that smoking in restaurants could affect the food quality. This is because the taste of food would be reduced as it absorbs the polluted air produced by smokers. The effect of this action could cause restaurants to face bad reviews as customers think it is the cook's fault. To summarize, food quality could be affected if smoking wasn't banned at all restaurants in the country.
       In conclusion, smoking should be banned at restaurants in the country as it would affect people's health and the restaurants' food quality.
