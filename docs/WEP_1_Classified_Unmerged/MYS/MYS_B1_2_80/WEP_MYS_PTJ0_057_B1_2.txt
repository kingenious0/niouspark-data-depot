 Student and employee is the different category. If you are the student then you are the student. Student is somewhat the person that go to school or college to acquire knowledge and get a good grade. Every student must have their own targeted in studies. Some of them must want to proud their parents and some must want to get a better future. I strongly disagree with the statement that college student should get a part time job.
	As it been said, people who want to be successful have to focus only on one thing. Getting a job when you are studying will disturb yourself in many ways. Student will not able to focus on the study. Even as a part time employee, we will still get busy because a lot of commitment at the work. The time that they spend at the workplace will make them have no time in studying. From that, college student basically spends less time in studying and doing no revision in their subject. The lack of period in studying will give a bad impact in their academic achievement and grade. 
	Besides that, working as a part time when you are the student will distract mental health. Every place had a different problem. Everyone knows that even a student had their own stressful such as assignment, group members, due date, money and so on. This thing goes the same to the employee and the problem is even worse than a student. Having a part time job just give a headache when we already have other things to settle up. Stressful in life only lead student to quit their studying that is detrimental.
	In conclusion, part time is not important for student because they have to be themselves as a student not employee.
