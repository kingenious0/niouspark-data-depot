 yes, I agree. smoking is a harmful habit that poses severe health risks for people who smell cigarette smoke, it even happens to the smoker himself. Since long ago, it has been a tradition for all smokers to smoke in restaurants. but it has a very bad effect on the community that is nearby, especially on children and pregnant mothers. now it needs enforcement that restaurants are non-smoking places for everyone's comfort. 
First and foremost, a complete smoking ban in restaurants is necessary to safeguard public health. Scientific studies have found that is a severe disease or cancer caused by smoking habits. for example, lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory problems.  The risk of exposure to second-hand smoke can be considerably decreased by outlawing smoking in restaurants, safeguarding both the health of patrons and staff. We must ensure that everyone lives in a secure and healthy environment.
second, smoking not only harms the health of smokers but also lowers the quality of the air in enclosed areas like restaurants. Cigarette smoke releases chemicals that can linger in the air for a very long time, resulting in poor indoor air quality. In small locations where ventilation may be restricted, this might be especially problematic. This problem can be resolved by outlawing smoking entirely within dining establishments, guaranteeing that patrons can breathe clean, fresh air while they dine.
lastly, by prohibiting smoking in these places, we can ensure clean air, lower the risk of illnesses brought on by second-hand smoke, and foster a healthy society. Making the health of workers, consumers, and future generations a priority is a critical step. Let's work to make eateries smoke-free and welcome a day when the public's health is put first.
