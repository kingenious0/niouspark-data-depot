 I agree that smoking should be banned entirely at all restaurants in the country because it takes away the right of other customers to breathe unpolluted air, it can danger the passive smoker, and the children at the restaurants will be exposed to smoking habits.

	Firstly, smoking in restaurants strips away customers' right to not breathe the secondary smoke. This is unacceptable as most of them come to restaurants and pay for the food, not the smoke. Besides, they will not appreciate inhaling the smoke as it prevents them from dining peacefully. Therefore, smoking in restaurants should be prohibited as it is a human right not to breathe secondary smoke.

	Secondly, smoking in restaurants will pose a health risk to other customers as they will indirectly become passive smokers. Passive smoking can lead to breathing difficulties, asthma attacks, and worse cancer. Hence, smoking in restaurants should be banned as it puts others' health in danger.

Lastly, children at the restaurants will be exposed to smoking habits if smoking there is allowed. As we are all aware, children are easily influenced, especially by adults, hence, they might be curious and start to smoke too if they are exposed to smokers. Therefore, smoking in restaurants should be banned as it gives bad exposure to youngsters.

	In conclusion, I strongly agree that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country as it violates other customers' rights, endangers others, and exposes children to harmful substances. The authorities should implement the law to punish those who smoke in restaurants.
