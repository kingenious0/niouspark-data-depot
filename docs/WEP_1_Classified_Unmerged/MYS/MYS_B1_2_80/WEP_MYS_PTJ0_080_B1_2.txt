 

I agree with the statement saying that   It is important for college students to have a part-time job.    Mostly student things are more expensive than what parents expected. Even loaned didn't provide enough money for student. Sometimes, student had to skip their meals to save money to buy others necessary. That is why some of them decide to do a part-time job to get side income a didn't give a burden to their parents. Students can do many jobs such as be a food agent, sell product, Tiktok affiliate and do printing service to earning extra income to finance their day-to-day needs. Many students rely on their part-time job finance to pay their education fees. Besides, student can develop their leadership skills, self-confidence especially when they experience their work during the semester break. It also helps students to build a good relationship with others and reduce students a lack of good communication between others. In other words, it helps student to feel courage when they are talking in front of their class. Perhaps, students are able to have time management skills because they acquire to balance their education and work and shouldn't abandoned their academics. To conclude, I am highly recommended for students to consider to do a part-time job because it worth it.
