In my opinion, I strongly agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. This is because students can learn knowledge which may beyond the theoretical knowledge that can obtained during the lecture in college. As we know, students are able to learn theoretical knowledge when studying in college, however, they can get extra practical experience when doing a part-time job. For me, this is indeed a golden opportunity, whereby students can apply their theoretical knowledge in the workplace. Apart from that, part-time job is an analogy for internship, where students can get exposed to various graduate attributes such as communication skills, critical thinking skills, adaptability skills, problem solving skills, teamworking and leadership skills. In the workplace, it is important for students to sharpen their communication skills to avoid misunderstandings among each other. This practical experience will definitely enhance their problem-solving and critical thinking skills. Moreover, college students are encouraged to have a part-time job as it will provide an additional income to cover their daily expenses. This will reduce parent's burden and enhance student's financial management skills indirectly. As the saying goes,  All works and no play make Jack a dull boy.  Working a part-time job can release student's stress in the academic field rather than spending time to study and do revision for the whole day. Thus, it is important for college students to have a part-time job due to the reasons aforementioned.
