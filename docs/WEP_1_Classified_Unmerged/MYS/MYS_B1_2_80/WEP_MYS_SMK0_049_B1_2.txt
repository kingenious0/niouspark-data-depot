 
Smoking could lead dangerous impact to our health. I'm totally agree that smoking should completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. From my experience, smokers feel they want to vomit after ate. So that, they will smoke at their table and doesn't care about their surroundings even with their that don't like the cigarettes smell.  The customers also feel not comfortable at restaurant with smoke surrounding them. Especially they bring their children to the restaurant. The parents do not want their children get sick because of the smoking effect. Restaurant also played their role to prevent the smoking occurs at the restaurant by showing the signboard of no smoking in the restaurant. The cigarettes contain a lot of dangerous chemical ingredients. The ingredients make smokers feel addicted to smoke more cigarettes. Smoking at restaurants shows that, person does not have common sense to environmental. Customers who saw people smoke at restaurants; they should report it to the Malaysia Health Department to fine them for smoking at restaurants. Everyone should play their role to prevent people smoking at restaurants that will brings healthy environment for us. It will show to the world that our country free from smoking that could have an impact on to our healthy.
