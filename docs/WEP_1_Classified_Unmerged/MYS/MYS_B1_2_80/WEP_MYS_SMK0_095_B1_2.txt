Based on the following statement, I agree that smoking should be completely banned in at all the restaurants in the country. As an individual, we should acknowledge that restaurant is a public place where everyone will be gathered around. There are lots of reasons on why smoking should be banned in restaurant. 

First, smoking should be banned in restaurant because it is a place where people are having their food. By smoking, it could make them feel uncomfortable to eat peacefully because of the smoke that is smelly and contains a chemical. Thus, the food might become bad or poisonous if smoking is not banned in the restaurant. 

Next, smoking should be banned in restaurant because it is public places. Many people are gathered there even a pregnant woman. It can cause a harm to the baby in the stomach that might lead to death or having an issue when the baby is born. That is why, smoking need to be banned completely.

Besides, the reason why it should be banned in restaurant because it might cause a lung cancer to people in the restaurant. There are a lot of people so imagine how many of them will get infected by the smoke. We do not want to lose a fragile people who do not do any wrong. Hence, smoking should be banned completely in any restaurant in the country.

The reasons mentioned above are why I think that smoking should be banned in at all the restaurants in the country because it brings more harm than good. We need to love ourselves and others because we only live once so live it as healthy as we could and give more benefit to others rather than disadvantages.
