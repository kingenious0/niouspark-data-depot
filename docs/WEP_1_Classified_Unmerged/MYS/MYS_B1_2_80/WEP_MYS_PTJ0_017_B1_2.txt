In college life, students may be taught to gain experiences on how to get high score in academic aspect but when they come to real life working situation, they may be lack of the experiences that need to be acquired in the real working society. Therefore, it is important for college student to gain working experiences related or not related to the course they were studying. The experiences may be related on how to deal with different types of people, how to communicate effectively in a team, etc. With all the experiences gained during the part time job, college students are able improve their self-confidents level and thus build up their self-personal traits such as responsibility, team working ability, rationality, etc. Moreover, college students with a part time job can not only gain working experiences but they can earn some extra pocket money.
