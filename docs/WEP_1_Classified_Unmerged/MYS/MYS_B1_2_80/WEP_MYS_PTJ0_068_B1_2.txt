 yes, I agree. Students frequently struggle with the decision of whether or not to work a part-time job while pursuing higher education. This is because a university student really needs a lot of money, which can be used to support daily life. that is no longer mixed with the college fees, tuition fees, and book fees demanded by the institution, it is very burdensome for some students who cannot afford it. however, it can be a distraction for students to focus on their academics and the activities at university but it can be easy when they know how to manage their time. honestly, a part-time job offers many benefits that can enhance the overall development of college students.
one of the benefits that can improve the overall development of a college student is that having a part-time job during college is an opportunity to be financially independent. when they have a monthly salary even if it is not fixed, they can pay all the necessary fees on time and without having to borrow money from others. Students who work for themselves are able to stand on their own two feet, reducing the pressure on their families and giving them the opportunity to develop important money management skills.
lastly, they can too have real-world experience. part-time jobs teach college students what the taste of the real world can be. it allows them to interact with people from various backgrounds, improve communication and interpersonal skills. students learn to adapt to different work environments, handle challenges, and collaborate effectively within a team. Such opportunities are priceless because they strengthen practical abilities that cannot be learned exclusively via academic study and supplement classroom instruction.
