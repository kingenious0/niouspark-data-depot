 I agree with the statement that smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country. Smoking has become a habit in society, regardless of location. Smoking has also had a variety of negative effects on the ones around it, especially in the restaurants. There are several reasons why smoking should be banned in restaurants in every country such as there are customers with chronic diseases, cigarette smoke that can disturb others, and cigarette ash that can get into food.
First of all, smoking should be banned in restaurants because there are customers with chronic illnesses that we often fail to notice. For example, asthma can cause a person to have difficulty breathing, so smoking will have an effect on the respiratory system. As a result, smoking should be banned in order to protect people's health.
Second, smoking should be banned in restaurants because it is disruptive to others. A restaurant is a gathering place for many people regardless of age or youth. For example, smokers who smoke there will disturb the peace of other people who are eating, including children or babies who are still small with the unpleasant smell of the smoke. thus, cigarette smoke will make a person feel uneasy.
Finally, smoking should be banned in restaurants because cigarette ash can contaminate the food. Cigarettes are made from illegal chemicals that cause addiction and harm to one's health. For example, if a person smokes, the cigarette ash will spread and go into the food it could be harmful to us. This demonstrates why smoking should be banned as soon as possible.
To summarise, smoking has numerous disadvantages for smokers and nonsmokers that should be banned. As a result, the responsible party should issue orders and summonses to anyone who violates the order by smoking, especially in restaurants.
