 Smoking brings a lot of bad health problems to smokers themselves, but also affects the people surrounding them. In fact, there are lots of smokers who do not care about the people surrounding them and just smoke wherever they like, a restaurant is one of the places they like to smoke. In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
First, restaurant is a closed area, which should be clean for any people to dine in. If someone smokes there, the smoke will pollute the environment, causing the dishes to be polluted and affects the appetite of other consumers. Also, the surrounding will also become bad smell. It will be a big problem for the owner to clean up the restaurant.
Second, if anyone smokes in the restaurant, other consumers will inhale the second-hand smoke, causing significant damage to the health. If the victims are toddlers or old people, it will cause additional health problems. They have no way to hide while they are eating, but only finish their meal faster and get away as soon as possible. 
All in all, smokers should always be aware of their surroundings before they want to smoke. Not only restaurants, I hope smoking should be completely banned at any indoor, including cinema, library etc.
