 In my personal opinion, I don't agree with that statement and not all the restaurant should be banned from smoking.The reason is that behaviour are individual freedom and choice.To justify, opponents of a smoking have the freedom to make their won choices and including whatever or not to smoke.They believe that ban a infringes upon personal liberty and interferes with the rights of smokers to enjoy their habit in public spaces.Furthermore, i disagree with that because business impact can happend.Some argue that banning smoking in restaurants could have a negative impact on businesses,particularly smaller establishments.They claim that smoking petrons may choose to eat elsewhere it hey cannot smoke,leading to potential financial losses for restaurants.Not just that,instead of an outright ban, proponents of smoking suggest the establishment of designated smoking areas or improved ventilation systems in restaurants.They argue that this would allow non-smokers to avoid secondhand smoke while still accommondating  smokers.Moreover, it is for custumer preference.To be more clear, critics of smoking bans contend that some customers may actually prefer establishments that allow smoking. They argue that by catering to the preferences of both smokers and non-smokers,businesses can provide a wider range  of options to atrract and retain customers.lastly,it is enforcement challenges.Opponents of smoking bans also raise concerns about practicality and enforcement of such measures.they also argue that it may be difficult to monitor and enforce a ban effectively, potentially placing an additional burden on restaurant owners and staff.To sum up everything,while it is essential to promote a smoke-free environtment and discourage smoking due to its harmful effects,it is equally important to approach the issue with empathy,understanding, and a non- judgemental mindset.By doing it, we can foster a more inclusive and supportive society.
