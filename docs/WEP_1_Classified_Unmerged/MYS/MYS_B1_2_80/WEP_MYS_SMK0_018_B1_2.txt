In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. As we know, smoking brings a lot of cons to human's health and cause a lot of chronic diseases such as bronchitis and lungs cancer. Statistically, the fatality of these chronic diseases is considered at high level as large number of smokers passed away every year. Owing to these reason, smoking should be avoided by everyone to secure their health. Moreover, restaurant is the public place where people gather and eating. Smoking in public area undoubtedly a selfish behaviour as it brings a larger impact on people who don't smoke due to the secondary smokes. 'Secondary smokers' is referred to a person who inhales the air with smoke exhaled by primary smoker and usually the impact on secondary smokers is larger then primary. As what we can see on news, there is a lot of death due to the lungs cancers even though they are not a smoker. However, most of them stayed in a same condition where their family and friends are smokers. These cases have shown that, the damages don't limit to the smokers themselves but also to the closed contacts. So, smoking in restaurant should be banned to protect customers' health and secure a safety environment to enjoy the food.
