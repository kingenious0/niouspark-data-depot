 Whenever we pass by driving here and there on the streets, we can often saw people holding on a lighted cigarette standing to pass time. However, there are still no strong legislation found in the country to banned smoking at restaurants. Thus, there are several reasons why the smokers are not welcomed at the restaurants in the country.

Firstly, one of the reasons is due to smoking can affects the health of not only the smokers but also the other customers at the restaurant. For outdoor restaurant, the wind could help blow away the smoke from the smokers. However, the situation get worse for indoor restaurant as the air circulation in indoor restaurant is through air-conditioning, in which the smoke would keep circulating in the same space. 
Besides, by allowing smoking at the restaurant will not benefits the customers from the business vision. As restaurants are opting to attract people, which includes families and large group of people. The ingredients found in the cigarette such as nicotine, are harmful to the human lungs especially for the babies as their lungs have not been fully develop. 
Next, smoking costs a lot, be it to the smoker or the owner of a restaurant. A cigarette costs almost two meals in Malaysia on a daily basis. While for the restaurant owner, they need to take out extra money to clean and install air-filtration machines for the sake of health. 

Overall, smoking should not be allowed at all the restaurant in the country as smoking is costly, affects the health of the customers and will decrease the revenue of the restaurant. I agree with the statement where smoking should be completely banned at all of the restaurant in the country due to the reasons stated above.
