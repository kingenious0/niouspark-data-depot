I agree with the statement that college students should have a part time job. It is because their attention will be averted from study after a hectic and stressful working environment which provides a great platform for them to make a balance between job and academic. This challenge also strengthens their time management skill to prioritise tasks and avoid unnecessary distractions. Moreover, in my point of view as a typical Malaysian college student, I can conclude that most of my college friends had some hard times to tackle insufficient time problem due to lack of useful approach such as setting up a time schedule or building a to do list. Some of them also showing signs of low energy level during day time. Thus, I strongly believe that part time job presents a solid training ground for those who have the urge to build up their time and energy management skills. It is also true that college students may take up new soft skill through part time job. For instance, for those who had stepped foot into restaurant or food stalls will be awarded knowledge in culinary skill through constant training. This experience will also be beneficial to those college students who have undergone their career as a professional chef in a long run. On the other hand, part time job may affect academic performance in the long terms. However, I feel that it does not affect much for those who had strong discipline lifestyle.
