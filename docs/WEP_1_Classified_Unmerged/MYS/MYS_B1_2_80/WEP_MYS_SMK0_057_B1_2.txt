 World is fully with many types of persons. There are people who knows to act accordingly in every situation and some do not even think about that. Smoking is definitely banned in public place. It has been authorised in the government and even the act had been shows. Every stall in this country has put a sign with  no smoking  as a warning to customers. I strongly agree that with the statement smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
	The reasons why I agree is smoking can give uncomfortable socialism at public. A smoker will give a smell to the other customers at the restaurants because of the smoke. Because of that, they cannot eat properly and felt disturbing. This action can provoke the eager of other customer at the place. All of the person at restaurants has a right to eat comfortably as they paid for it. It is reasonable for smoking to be banned at the restaurants.
	Other than that, smoking is such an appropriate attitude as a human being. Smoker will be labelled as a selfish person because they do not care about others person. Public place has a lot of people in different level of health. Some of them must has asthma with is dangerous for them when smell the smoke. They tend not to be considerable to others person when they smoke. In addition, the dust from the cigarettes will only spoil the restaurants. It shows that smoking just given negative impact to the social environment.
	In conclusion, cigarettes are not something allowed but it has been norm to every person especially a man.
