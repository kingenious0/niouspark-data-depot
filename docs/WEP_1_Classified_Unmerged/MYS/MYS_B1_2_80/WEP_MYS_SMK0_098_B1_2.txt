      As years pass, people start to adapt themselves to many cultures and habits across the world. One of the habits followed by mostly everyone is smoking. This started when people discovered the pleasure of smoking tobacco. Nowadays people have normalized these and started to smoke everywhere. As everyone knows smoking is injurious to health this also harms the people in the surrounding. Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I agree with this statement as smoking in a restaurant is unhealthy behavior.
     Firstly, smoking should be banned at restaurants as these places are frequently visited by family, outsiders and children. People who do not smoke get affected by the same level of nicotine and toxic chemicals as the person who smokes. This can lead to an unhealthy environment as people will find the smoke unpleasant. Everyone should remember that restaurant is a public place and unhealthy behaviors should be avoided.
     Furthermore, smoking should be banned at restaurants as these place serves food and drinks to customers. The level of hygiene this place has is very important. People will find it unpleasant and dirty if random people smoke around the restaurants. This also leads to people leaving the restaurants. 
     Moreover, smoking should be banned at restaurants as it could lead to serious health issues. Normally pregnant ladies and children will be at the restaurants. We need to remember that people who inhale the smoke can have health issues too. These can lead to respiratory issues and difficulties in breathing. 
     In conclusion, smoking should be banned at restaurants as it is a public place and serves food and drinks.
