 
I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country; who wouldn't, right? Smoking as we know can lead to serious disease in human health either active smoker or passive smoker. Research saying that passive smoker will more affects their health. Besides, smoking should be stop in restaurants because the cigarettes butt will dump all over the place and they didn't put all the cigarettes butt at the container box as the restaurants provided. It so messy to looked at all the cigarettes butt on the floor and end up the worker need to pick and throw it. It happened frequently every single time I went to the restaurants and saw the smoker without feeling guilty throw the cigarettes on the floor. Other than that, atleast have sympathy for the baby and the children because smoke from the cigarettes lead to difficulty breathing properly especially Asthma people really suffered for this. Please have some respect for others. You are not living this world alone. So, tolerate with other people too. Don't be selfish. To conduct all of this, smoking is really danger to people health because of materials that contain in the cigarettes can lead to died and lungs affection.
