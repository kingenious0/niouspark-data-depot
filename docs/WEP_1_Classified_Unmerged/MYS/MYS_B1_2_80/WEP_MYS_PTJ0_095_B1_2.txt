Based on the following statement, I agree that it is important for college students to get a part time job. Many people would say that it may makes the students lose their focus in class if they are doing a side job. However, there are lot of advantages for college students who get a part time job while still studying. 

First advantage of doing a part time job is that the students can earn their own money. Not all students were born with a golden spoon in their hand so to balance their money for college fees and food are very difficult. Hence, by having a part time job, they can get more money to help them in college. 

Next, by having a part time job, the college students can learn on how to be independent. Working somehow can teach someone to be independent as they need to work alone or doing something by themselves. Thus, it helps the students to be depending on themselves more which help them to improve themselves to survive the world. 

Besides, having a part time job can help the college students to increase their skill especially in socializing with others. They will meet a lot of people with different personality which help them to understand on how to socialize with different person based on their personality. 

Nevertheless, getting a part time job really helps them a lot in terms of money, being independent as well as increasing their skill.  It might be tiring but the experience that they can learn are much more than they could get in college.
