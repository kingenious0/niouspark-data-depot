 In my opinion i would disagree with that statement and why i disagree with that statement because they have a lot of disadvantages when they work and study in 24 hours. The reason why i disagree with the statement given is student can't focus on their study. That's mean they can't complete the task given and it will affect your mark in final examination. That's why student need to get enough rest for their academic in college.     
The second reason is when they usually do a part time job and make their own side income it will make student feel they don't need to study hard to make money. The reason to study is just not only to earn money that have a lot of benefits when you have a knowledge other than you have money but lack of knowledge newspaper Berita Harian write   a lot of SPM candidates prefer not to study and just go for work . That's mean it also can happen to the college students. 
The last reason that supports my opinion is it will be a problem to their groupmate when have an assignment that involve a lot of people. For example, when student that do a part time job, he can be busy with their job after classes and doesn't have enough time to complete their part of the assignment. Cause of that it will affect mark of their group just because one person all their groupmates will have low marks.         
 In conclusion it will make a negative effect to themselves and the others and that's why in totally disagree with that statement. If they can't afford study it can borrowed to PTTN or apply scholarships that will support their financial while studying.
