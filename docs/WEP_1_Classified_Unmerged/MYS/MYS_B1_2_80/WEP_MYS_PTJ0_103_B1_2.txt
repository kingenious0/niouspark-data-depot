"Juggling between academic and work life at a young age could be troublesome. However, I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. This short essay will elaborate on two importance of part-time jobs to students which are gaining more pocket money and building up self growth. 

The prime reason why college students need to have a part-time job is definitely because they can get more pocket money to spend. Teenagers nowadays might have their own wish list to pamper themselves in coping with academic stress, such as cafe hopping for Instagrammable photos, purchasing new garments or even paying for Netflix subscription. However, to tick off the wishlist, they first need to consider between what they need and what they want. For example, they need to utilize the money given by parents or their allowance to cater for their academic purposes. So, when they have a part-time job, they can spare some money from the wage to get things they want, without jeopardizing their expenses for academic purposes. 

Next, it is important for students to have a part-time job to build up their self-growth in society. In students' world, it is undeniably important to focus on their academics. However, they must also  polish their soft skills in themselves, as well as being optimist to gain new life experience that will surely help them in working life later on. By having a part-time job, it will widen their experience with the community, especially when dealing with people from different backgrounds upon working. For example, when they work as a waiter at a cafe, they will learn how to discipline themselves to follow their work schedule punctually and they can even sharpen their communication skills and problem solving skills upon attending the customers."
