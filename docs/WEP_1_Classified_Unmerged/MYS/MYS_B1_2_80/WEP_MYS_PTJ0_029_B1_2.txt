It is important for college students to have a part-time job. I totally agree with this statement. I think that student should always have one or two part-time jobs because it brings more benefits than disbenefits. First of all, student can spend their extra time on part-time job rather than wasting it on meaningless activities such as oversleeping and loitering. For example, a college student often has semester break at the end of every semester, he can go find any part-time job that he interested at to prevent boredom and wasting of time. Apart, college students can get extra money from part -time job. For example, I always have my own salary from the part-time job that I find. College students also can have various work experience from part-time job like cashier, waiter, maid and barista. For example, my friend Shirley gets her own barista license thanks to her one-year experience in the café that she became a part-timer. Moreover, college student can get to know many new friends and coworkers in their workplace. For example, Karry gets to know his roommates in the restaurant they both work as a part-timer waiter, shortly after the job, they share a room together thanks to the mutual trust and friendship they build in their workplace. To sum up, college students should always find a part-time job because it is a fun way to enjoy life.
