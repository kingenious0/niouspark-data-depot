 I disagree with that statement because college students should focus on their study. Study is important for college students to have bright future. If they need money, they can ask his/her parents. College students are still under their parent's responsibility. If they don't want to burden their parents, they can ask for PTPTN but after they finished their study, they should pay back the money. In my opinion if you have part time while you still studying, you will have a lot of things to do in one time. For the example, you must go work at the same time you have to finish your assignment at that time how can you do two things in one time? For me it impossible! Furthermore, your body will not get enough rest. For your information, students should get enough sleep from 5 to 8 hours per day. When you get enough sleep, your body can work well also your mind can think well too. Besides that, when you have a part time jobs you don't have time with your friend. You supposed to have a great time with your friend while study because after you finish your studies you must focus on work. Great time with your friend cannot be repeat, so don't miss it.
