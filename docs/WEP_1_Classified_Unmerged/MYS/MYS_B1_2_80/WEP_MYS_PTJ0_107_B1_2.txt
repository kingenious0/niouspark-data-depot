"I agree. Balancing studying and working are a great feat for students as they could reach unfathomable things for themselves and the people around them. Therefore, I will elaborate the main reasons part-time jobs are deemed as crucial for college students.
First of all, the experience gained from working will be a valuable asset once students graduated from their schools. It is known that job hunting will pose as a difficult challenge for a fresh graduate since companies tend to accept candidates with work experience. For instance, those that worked part-time as cashiers or promoters may have higher chances in being accepted in a job centred on marketing. This is because they will have the right skills to approach the customers and understand their needs. In short, college students must consider working part-time job since the experience could tremendously help them to navigate their working life. 
 After that, it is no doubt that having part-time job help students to be financially stable. As we know, most countries don't have free education, making students require a great amount of money just to pursue tertiary education. This leads to some students, particularly those from lower income families need to unwillingly drop out of the college since they do no have enough money to pay for colleges' fee. Hence, rather than relying on parents or guardians for money to continue their educations, it is advised for students to keep a part-time job in order to support themselves and successfully finish graduating without a hitch. 
 In conclusion, college students must have part-time job to get working experience while receiving income that will support them through their studies. I am sure that with part-time jobs, students can grow to be an irreplaceable member of the workforce in our nation.
