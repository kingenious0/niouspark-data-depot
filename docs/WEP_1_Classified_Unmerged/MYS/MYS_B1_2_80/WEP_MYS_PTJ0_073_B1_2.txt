Studying and working both have pros and cons for students, especially in their college life. But all college students have the right to choose whether to work while studying or just focus on their studies. For my opinion, I disagree with the statement which is college student should have a part-time job. This is because at their age, the main thing they should do is keep focusing on studying to get a better job in future. In addition, although working helps students to have an income to support their college bills but it can affect their study performance. This is because they need to focus on two different things at the same time. For example, they may have disrupted sleep habits and high levels of stress. Plus, in college there are a lot of assignments that need to be submitted on time whether individually or in a group. They maybe do not have enough time to focus and finish the assignments on time. Next, the working environment is so different from studying because they need to involve and consider other people in their life. So, to conclude, as a student we should focus on our studies to get a better life in future and make our parents proud of us.
