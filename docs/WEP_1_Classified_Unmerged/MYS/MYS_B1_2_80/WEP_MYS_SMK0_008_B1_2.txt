I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant in Malaysia. As I learned before, the dangerous brought to secondary smokers are more than that for people who smoke. Restaurant is one of the public places that everyone will gather here including those children. Smoking in these places is totally an irresponsible action that will cause harm to others. The unpleasant smell of smoking also is one of the main reasons that no smoking should be allowed at restaurant. The smoke smell will retain at the air conditioner for a long period, it will disturb the others having their meal and the owner has to pay for the smoker's action. It is normal for a Malaysian family to have a dinner at family day, in this case the smoker is playing a negative role for those children who having meal at the same restaurant. Not only that, the ash from the cigarette also one of the problems brought by the smokers. Although there is a period that ash container was prepared on the table, the ash will somehow drop either on the table or floor. This condition has caused so many troubles to the cleanliness of a restaurant which directly affect a restaurant operation as the cleanliness grade is one of the guidelines in choosing restaurant. Next, the ash dropped onto the floor will cause it to be more slippery, which is one of the hidden dangerous to the customers and the workers. Although sometime the clean workers able to clean it on time, any hidden dangerous situation shall be fully excluded.
