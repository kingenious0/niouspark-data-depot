 The debates regarding whether students  should have part-time jobs nowadays have been going on for quite a long time. Personally, having a part-time job while studying is quite a hustle.I disagree with the statement that it is important for students to have a part-time job because students are unable to focus on study, lack of time and affect health negatively. 

Firstly, students aren't able to focus on studying. The main purpose of becoming a student is that they should be putting hundred percent effort into their studies. However, if students have a part-time job, they are unable to give full attention and commitment in their study. For instance, students would be distracted thinking of their part-time job in lecture.

Secondly, students would have a lack of time in studying.  This is said because students would spend their remaining time with jobs and this would probably take about 6 hours. After they are done with their job, they would need a rest and just ignore their studies. This would contribute to lack of revision. 

Lastly, a part-time job would affect health negatively.  A part-time job requires lots of energy from the worker. If the worker also is a student, they are unable to take a good rest throughout the day. Thus, lack of rest would just contribute to severe health issues such as heart attacks, insomnia and anxiety. 



In conclusion, a part-time job is unnecessary for students. However,  if students are out of money, they could still apply for sponsorship or have good time management if they insist on working. The main purpose of students is focusing on their study.
