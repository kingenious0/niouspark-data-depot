 I strongly agree with that statement.my particular reason for why I am agree with that circumstance is college student need money to support their spending in university.To be more specific,obviously student need a lot of money to buy studies stuff,foods,paying fees and many more.Not just that, some student barely got money from their parents because some of it cant affort to cover their children's expenses.So they have work on their own to get the money to survive in university.Furthermore,it vital for college students because they can gain experience from working.To be more clear they get know about a new things,get a knowledge and also can learning about new skills.So, in the future students can use these experience at somewhere else.Then,gaining independece also one of the reason why it is important for college student.It is because the student will take all the responsible for their own schedule,money and duties.From this,the students will be less reliant on other people.Not just that,It is important because its help student to manage their money.It is because when we start making money,we tend to be more cautious about how we spend our hard earned money.In other words,we will be more appriciate on our hardship.Moreover, studients can also gain the confident when working on part time job.It is because mostly part time job for student are mainly customer facing industries.So they wil be force to interact with a lot of people and especially with customer.As a result, you are smoothly comfortable with talking to people.To sum up everything that has been stated,part-time job can give a lot of benefits to college students.Its not just make student gaining money but also a lot of things the can gain.
