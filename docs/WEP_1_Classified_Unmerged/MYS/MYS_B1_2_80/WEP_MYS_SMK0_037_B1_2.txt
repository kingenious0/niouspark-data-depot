Yes, I completely agree with the statement above. The first reason is the smoke could affected other people health and could be very dangerous especially for people with chronic illness, senior citizens, pregnant women and children. Second-hand smoke could be very dangerous for the restaurant clients and the staffs when they exposed to the smoke. Next, smoking should be banned at restaurant also because it would be uncomfortable for other people in the same restaurant because of the smell. This can be very disturbing for people at the restaurant because they are eating, spending time with their family and having a good time. Smokers should be alert with their surrounding to make sure that they are not making other people uneasy. Moreover, smokes from cigarettes would pollute the environment especially closed area place such as restaurant. It will make the restaurant not suitable to dine in because the ventilation is full of the smoke. . Other than that, smoke from the cigarettes also could affected other clients health, for example, restaurant's clients that had asthma chronic. This kind of situation will affected the client's health issues and could lead to death. As a responsible citizen, smokers should be alert and take note where is the suitable place to smoke without threatening other people health and moments.
