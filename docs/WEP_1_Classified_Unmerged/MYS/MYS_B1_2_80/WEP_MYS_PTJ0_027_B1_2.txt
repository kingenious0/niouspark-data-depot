I agree with the topic discussed. College students should have a part-time job as working on a part-time job can help students to gain experience in the working place. As people always said, practical is more important than theory, hence having a part-time job provides a good opportunity for college students to learn things that are from outside classes. Other than that, they can train their soft skills by learning how to communicate and deal with different people from different backgrounds and different education levels. By meeting new people or making new friends, they get to widen their eyesight and gain knowledge from people that are experts in different fields. Having a part-time job also helps to increase college students' pocket money. They can buy things they like with the money they owned by themselves. Besides, they will become more independent as they experienced that earning money is quite tough and time-consuming. Before making any purchases, they will become wiser in deciding whether the things that they bought are necessary or not. College students will also be more alert to the price of their daily necessities since they are spending their own money. They will try to compare the price of the products between a few shops and buy things at a cheaper price. Instead, by working a part-time job, some college students can also save the money they earned for future use. To conclude, having a part-time job benefits college students but students must manage their time well so that they would not miss out on their academics.
