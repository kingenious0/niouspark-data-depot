 I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. The reasons is why First of all, they claim that those who choose to be passive smokers do so by coming to locations where smoking is legal. They are not required to go to locations where passive smoking is allowed if they would prefer not to. Additionally, they think that a prohibition may force many clubs and pubs out of business since smokers would stop frequenting them. They contend that the issue of decision freedom is involved. Since smoking is not illegal, people should be allowed to smoke wherever they like. There are stronger justifications for a prohibition, though. Smokers find it difficult to comprehend how non-smokers feel about and are impacted by their freedom to light up a cigarette. The majority of smokers also believe it is OK to indulge in their habit outside since the smoke would rapidly vanish. Even individuals who are concerned about other people's welfare are unaware that smoking in a public outdoor area may easily upset someone who is 10 feet away. Only non-smokers can understand how this is both true yet unpleasant, nasty, and filthy. the appropriate to a safe atmosphere. Smokers are accountable for creating a secure and hygienic atmosphere in all establishments. While a supporter of the smoking ban may easily reply,  Eat somewhere without smoke,  I would counter that your insistence on smoking in public is not as crucial to their health and way of life. People shouldn't be forced to switch restaurants for their own health and welfare because smokers can't control their desires.
