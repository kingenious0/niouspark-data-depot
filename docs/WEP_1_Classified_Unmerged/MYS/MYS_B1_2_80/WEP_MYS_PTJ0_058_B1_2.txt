    College is a place where students gain some knowledge for their future. Having a part time job while studying or focusing on academic can provide a good benefit also making it easier for a person that has financial issues while studying at university. I agree that college students to have a part time job. First, it will be a very good opportunity to have no financial problems and achieve freedom in spending money at a young age. Students also will be prevented from taking out loans from PTPTN and ease the burden on parents to pay the cost of their children's education. Second, skill development. Working part time can give students experience or the opportunity to get to know the outside world. This also can train students to manage time properly but not only for while studying in college but also for the future in careers life. Lastly, build networks or connections. Part time work will get students used to interacting with strangers. Building connections with many people can bring us many benefits in the future. So, the skill to interact with people is very important in our lives, especially for men who will be a father to his kids in the future. In conclusion, students that are not from rich family but want to have a freedom in spending money should find a way how to achieve that freedom. Like doing part time job or others. It will bring a good benefit, but it is also important for students to spend their money on things that give a benefit to themselves.
