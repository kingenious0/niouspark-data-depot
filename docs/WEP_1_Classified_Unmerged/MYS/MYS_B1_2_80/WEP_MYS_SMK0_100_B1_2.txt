"  Smoking is a bad habit that causes most health issues. It does not only put smokers in danger, but it also gives disadvantages to the people surrounding them. In my opinion, I agree that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country.
  Generally, smoking causes health issues. There are people from different backgrounds around us in the restaurant. Respiratory infections, ear infections, and asthma attacks are the most common issues that can be found among children if they inhale excessive smoke of cigarettes. It is a selfish action to smoke in a restaurant because people around us might have health issues that could not breath in smoke. 
  Besides that, smoke in restaurants will affect the feeling of other customers. This is because someone might not like the smell of the smoke. Personally, I would choose to keep distance with those who smoke in a restaurant because I will feel uncomfortable when I inhale the smoke.
  Furthermore, it is responsible for everyone to keep public areas clean and well vandalized. Smoking will leave a bad smell and it may stay for a few hours if the restaurant is air-conditioned. Restaurants need to hygiene so that customers are willing to eat there. Therefore, smokers can choose to smoke in other areas. 
  Overall, smoking in restaurants should be completely banned because it brings a lot of harmful effects.
