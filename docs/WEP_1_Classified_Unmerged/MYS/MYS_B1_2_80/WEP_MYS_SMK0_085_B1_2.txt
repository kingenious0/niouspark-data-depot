 Smoking publicly, especially at restaurants has been the main issue recently. The rate of smokers at restaurants has increased by day to day.  I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants because it affects health negatively, lack of manners and a bad influence. 

Firstly, smoking should be banned because it affects health negatively. Smoking doesn't only impact the prime smoker thus the person that sits near the smoker or so called secondary smoker would also inhale the nicotine. People that inhale the smoke would have a hard time breathing. For instance,  in restaurants the space is quite packed and if someone is smoking, the people that sit next to the smoker would instantly cough from the impacts of nicotine. 

Secondly, smoking at restaurants shows a lack of manners. This is said because it is a place for people to enjoy food but by smoking there it would just cut others' appetite. The smell of food would be covered with the smell of nicotine. For instance, both parties pay the same amount to enjoy food however one of them is disturbed by the smell of smoke.

Lastly, smoking at restaurants is a bad influence. Restaurants are mainly packed with families. Families with younger children would influence their children that smoking is a cool thing to do. At a young age, children have this intuition to do things that happen in front of them such as smoking. This would influence them negatively. 

In conclusion, I strongly agree that smoking should be banned at all restaurants.  The disadvantages of smoking mainly dominate in each aspect. Hopefully,  the government will take serious action regarding this issue.
