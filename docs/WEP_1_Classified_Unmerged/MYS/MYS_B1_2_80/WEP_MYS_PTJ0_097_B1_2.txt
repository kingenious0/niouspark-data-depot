However, college students wouldn't survive in their workplace if they were only to focus on their studies. I strongly agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job as they can increase their own financial support, soft skills and meet new people in a different environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                 
        Firstly, college students need to have a part-time job because they can cover their own financial support. This is because they also need more money than the loans provided. For example, they can use their salary to buy daily necessities while use their loan to pay studies fees. To conclude, having a part-time job is important for students as it would help their financial support.
        Secondly, it is important because it can improve students' soft skills. This is because they get to learn the skills that don't get to learn in classrooms. For example, students get to grasp communication skills with customers which are important for their future clients. To summarize, students' soft skills can be improved by getting part-time jobs.
      Thirdly, students can meet new people in different environments which can expand their maturity. This is because meeting different people give different experiences. For instance, students get to work with older people, so they need to be more polite to deal with the elderly. To conclude, students get to gain new experience from having a part-time job.
      All in all, it is important for students to have a part-time job as they can increase their own financial support, soft skills and meet new people in a different environment.
