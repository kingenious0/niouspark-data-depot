 Smoking is sucking cigarettes and make smoke. I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country because low hygiene in serving food, uncomfortable condition to other people, and disease.
Firstly, all restaurants should completely be banned in country because less hygiene for food. The dust of smoking will affect the hygiene quality taste of beverages. For example, chef not wash their dirty hand after smoking that have dust of cigarettes and make less hygiene in serving food and beverages.
Secondly, smoking will create uncomfortable condition to other people that's make smoking should be banned at all restaurant in country. Smoke from cigarettes will create uncomfortable smell that will make others customers at restaurant less their appetite to eat. As an illustration, the family as customer at the restaurant feel off to eat and distracted with smoke and bad smell from smokers near with them.
Thirdly, smoking should completely banned at all restaurant in country because smoking can give disease. In generally, lung disease is a major disease cause by smoke of cigarettes from smoker.  The passive smokers like the other people that sit in near distance with smokers will have more higher potential to get disease like asthma, lung disease, and bronchitis. As an example, child that have low body immune  system easy to affect their health like get asthma when near with smokers.
