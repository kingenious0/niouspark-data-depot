 Smoking is a well-known health issue that endangers both smokers and nonsmokers. To preserve public health and promote a healthy atmosphere, smoking must be fully prohibited in all restaurants across the country.
To begin with, a full prohibition on smoking in restaurants would greatly benefit public health. Secondhand smoking has been linked to a variety of respiratory and cardiovascular disorders. Nonsmokers would be safeguarded from the negative effects of secondhand smoke if smoking was prohibited in restaurants, resulting in a healthier eating experience for everybody. 
Second, removing smoking from restaurants would increase consumer pleasure. The presence of smoke while dining out deters many individuals, both nonsmokers and those who have stopped smoking. A smoke-free environment would draw more consumers, especially families and individuals who enjoy a clean, healthy environment. This, in turn, would stimulate and contribute to the restaurant industry's growth.
Finally, a smoking ban in restaurants would be economically beneficial. Employees who are healthier will take fewer sick days, resulting in greater production. Additionally, the expenditures for maintaining designated smoking places, ventilation systems, and cleaning smoke-related residues would be reduced. These cost savings might be used to improve food quality, service, and the entire customer experience.
Finally, a comprehensive ban on smoking in all restaurants is critical for the general public's health. Such a prohibition would promote a better and more pleasurable eating experience for everybody by prioritising public health, offering a smoke-free atmosphere, and reaping economic rewards. It is critical that the government take urgent action to implement and enforce this prohibition, encouraging a smoke-free culture and protecting people's health in our community.
