    I agree with that statement because the government has also made a law not to smoke at restaurants, so people must obey the law that has been made. Studies have found that people who smoke cigarettes will not live long because it is harmful to health.  Some reason why smoking should be banned at restaurants is to say no to cigarette smoke. By banning smoking in restaurants, it will be able to avoid harmful chemicals. As we know, cigarettes have dangerous ingredients including tobacco. So, it is very important to ban smoking at restaurant. Second, respect for people who don't smoke at restaurants. Do not endanger other non-smokers to become passive smokers just because of your selfishness. They have the right to eat their food in clean air that is free from smoke. Lastly, people at the restaurant is consist of various ages, it is important for smokers to not smoke there because it is possible that other people will feel like want to trying smoking, especially teenagers who have the desire to try something new. In conclusion, society needs to have common sense and know which places are free to smoke and which place that is not appropriate to smoke cigarettes, let us not spread a bod surrounding to others. Respect other people, don't be selfish just for self-interest.
