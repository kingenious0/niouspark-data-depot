 Despite the country is continuously developing, however the salary of the workers in the country still remain at the same rate. Therefore, some are still struggling to put food on tables. Not to mention for those college students that are required to pay for their tuition fees, hostel rental fees and daily necessities. Hence, the college students should find alternatives to find a source of income in their free time as to support their way of living, enhance new skills and find networking.
Next, one of the reasons the college students should have a part-time job is to have their own source of income. Part-time jobs nowadays can be tempting as some job vacancy offers high pay with low working hours which made easier for the college students to apply to. Students can make use of their free time to look for a suitable part-time job that align with their capabilities to earn extra.
In addition, not only the college students get to have income but also they get to develop new skills from the job. If we try to look at a bigger picture, the skills they developed from the part-time job are crucial when they become graduates. For instance, soft skills and hard skills like communication, team-working, adaptability and problem-solving are among the most required skills in the eye of an employer. 
Apart from that, the college students would also be beneficial from the fruitful experience as they acquire networking due to the part-time job. The students would expose to people from different background and professionals that will broaden their vision and the way of thinking. 
In conclusion, I do agree with the statement where it is vital for college students to have a part-time job as they would be beneficial from three aspects mentioned here.
