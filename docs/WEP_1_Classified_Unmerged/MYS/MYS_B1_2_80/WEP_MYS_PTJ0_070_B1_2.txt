 It is true that the proportion of college students  who work part-time is significantly rising as a result of economic and social development. It has consequently become one of the most controversional topics among students. Some believe that having a part-time job can provide some difficulties for students. Others contend that students can profit from working a part-time job. Personally, I strongly disagree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part time job as it can cause tiredness, effect on their studies and students may have no time to socializing.
Firstly, it can cause tiredness among the students. It goes without saying that having a job immediately means you have less time to accomplish the other things. Students who work part-time are constantly commuting to and from the workplace. As a result, students become worn out and may even skip class to rest after a long day. Additionally, they could feel pressure from a challenging or time-consuming assignment. It may also be harmful to one's health.
Secondly, students who work on a part time job are tend to have distraction on their studies. They will have a hectic schedule while working a part-time job, leaving them with less time for study and for themselves. Students will not have time to rest, which will make them feel tired and worn out and affect their ability to study.
Last but not least,  working and learning at the same time takes away students' free time so, they will not have a sufficient time to relax. For example, college students could not find some time for social activities and fulfill their leisure time.
In conclusion, college students should not have a part time job because it can affect their lives in every aspects.
