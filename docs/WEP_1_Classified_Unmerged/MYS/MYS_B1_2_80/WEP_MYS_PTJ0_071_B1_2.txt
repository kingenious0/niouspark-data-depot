 Mass media often displays the issue of students working while studying and gaining success from their own experiences. Work while studying is not an obstacle to success in learning. In fact, working while studying can have many positive effects on students. I support the statement that   it is important for college students to have a part-time job  . This is because, doing part-time work can have a good effect on students.
Working part-time while studying can help students to be independent in finding pocket money for daily use as well as studying. Being a student is not easy, a lot of money needs to be spent while studying especially when doing assignments, assignments projects and other assignments. Having a part-time job can help students cover their spending costs. Not many students come from happy families, this can also help students earn money to cover their own needs.
Recently, when students do part-time work such as at a restaurant, such as McDonald's, KFC, and so on, they will be able to learn to manage their time well. As we know, doing work while studying is not easy; therefore, doing work while studying can help students become more mature and disciplined in their time management. For example, students will make a daily schedule and study schedule; this will make them sensitive to personal matters, work matters, and study.
Therefore, working while studying can give students work experience. When students have experience on the job, this will make it easier for them to ask for work in the future. This is because many companies and employment sectors prefer skilled, educated, and experienced workers. The skills in the job can be used in the future and make it easier for students to not feel awkward doing a job.
 In conclusion, working part-time can have many positive effects on students.
