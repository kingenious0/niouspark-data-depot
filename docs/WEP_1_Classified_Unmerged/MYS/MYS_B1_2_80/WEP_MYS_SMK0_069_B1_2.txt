           We often heard that smokers want to quit smoking cigarettes, but most smokers do not. They gave a lot of excuses of why they do so. I absolutely agree that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country because not only cause harm to the smoker but to the people around them. I believe that smoking will causes many health problems as well as give bad influence to surrounding.

          First and foremost, smoking in public places will lead to health issues for both smokers and non-smokers. It affect almost every organ inside the body without us realizing it. For instance, anyone with a smoking habit are likely to have lung cancer, strokes and heart disease. The person who breathe the flames out from smokers will be affected as well. This means that, as a human being, we shall have tolerance and not being selfish just because of the addiction to cigarettes. 

          Moreover, smoking activities that happen in public give bad influence to the surrounding. This is because, people especially the youth or the children out there tend to think that smoking as a way to look cool or mature. Children tend to believe that it is just a normal behaviour when they see a man walking with cigarettes between the fingers but will harm them in the future. So, smokers should not take this as a joke and consider not too smoke in public spaces. 

          In conclusion, we can clearly see that smoking is a dangerous behaviour that kills people and give bad image to the younger generation. If possible to the smokers, quitting is the best idea to enjoy live happily with healthy environment.
