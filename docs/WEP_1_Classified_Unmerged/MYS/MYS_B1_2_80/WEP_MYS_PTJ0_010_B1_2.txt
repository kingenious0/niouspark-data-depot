 I agree with the statement which stated that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. As a college student, we will be stepping into our next path which is in the working environment and working part-time during our university's life undeniably will help to develop skills that required in the future workspace and if we are looking into long term wise, part-time job will bring more pros than cons to a college student too. If possible, part-time job related to the major would be much better.

The main task for a college student is to excel in the major that one is taking so that they would have a better chance to be offered a job that they are looking fo and with bonus on working part-time the percentage of receiving offer will become higher. This is because most of the companies preferably hiring someone who have been exposed to the working environment as this will required less time for the company to train the new workers. The college students who have been working on a part-time job get to establish their skills such as time management, communication skills and most importantly the technical skills that would be much useful to the company. 

Part-time job indirectly helps the students to develop better time management as they have to well handle both the studies and job at the same time. Learning on how to maintain a work life balance is a one of the main topics that has been discussed in todays's hectic world, therefore if a college student with part-time job could succeed from the packful and stressful life it should be considered as part of the achievement from part-time job too.
