In my opinion, it is unimportant for college students to have a part-time job. Involving in part-time job might affect students' academic performance if they don't manage their time wisely.  Apart from that, students might be distracted by the income gained from part time job and ignore their duty as a students. As what we often see on news, some students neglected their academic as they are focussing on gaining money to buy luxurious item such as phone, tablet to satisfy their desire. For a college student, time is the most precious thing for them during campus life. Thus, college students should focus and concentrate on their academic as it is the ultimate goal expected to achieve in the end of study. Therefore, college students should take their time to absorb the knowledge as much as they can. Other than academic, extra-curricular  is another crucial part which college students should focus on. Actively participate in various program such as volunteering event and campus society is able to provide the same experience as doing part-time jobs do. By involving themselves in those program, college students are able to work as a team and provide leadership skills while opportunities arise. Plus, joining extra-curricular events don't consume a lot of time as part time jobs do. College students are free to join their preferable program during their free time and gain the skills at the same time.  In a nutshell, I strongly disagree that having a part time job is important for college students.
