I strongly agree smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.  As everyone knows, cigarettes and cigarette smoke are very dangerous to health.  It causes lung problems, asthma, shortness of breath, premature ageing, cancer and so on.  A restaurant is a place where people eat, so if someone smokes, it will expose customers to secondhand smoke which can lead to illness.  Based on my own experience, when I was in a restaurant, there was a group of men smoking and blowing cigarette smoke in public.  Some customers cough because they can't smell cigarette smoke.  But the smoker doesn't care about others. If smoking is banned in all restaurants in this country, maybe this case won't happen anymore. Some say that second-hand smoke is exposed to the same chemicals as smokers, which is why they are so dangerous for those at risk, such as pregnant women, babies, children, the elderly and people with illnesses.  The cigarette box also displayed pictures of the effects of smoking, but smokers don't understand it and don't care. We as customers should also stay away from smokers. We take care of us. In conclusion, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country because it can cause disease.
