I partially agree that the statement stated that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Firstly, I disagree because as a student, the only goal to achieve is getting a good result. For me, that is our actual responsibility as a student. Besides, we need to be focus on studying without getting any distraction.  When doing two tasks in one time, it can affect ourselves mentally and physically. As example, students who do part-time job tend to get diagnosed with Depression and others mental problems. Furthermore, it will make a student missing out on social events and time with friends. It is because, as a young people, having fun and spend quality times with your loved ones is the best thing to do. Lastly, students may experience extreme tiredness from working. Less rest time will cause a fatigue. So that, students need to get enough rest time.  Furthermore, reason why I agree with the statement is because it will make you be more financially independent until you do not need to ask your parents for a money. After that, students that do part-time job will gain experience from that as a you can easily adapt with your real job scope in future. Otherwise, you can be a person that has greater understanding of work culture and strong to face the tough day. Lastly, we can make new friends. We can get to be friends with our colleagues and create a good bonding with them.
