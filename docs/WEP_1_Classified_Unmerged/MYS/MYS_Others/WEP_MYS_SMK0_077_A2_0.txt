In regards to the question, I totally agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It is because, smoker will harm people around them by the smoke from the cigarattes. I honestly have experienced and confront with smoker at the restaurant. It does really make me and my family uncomfortable with the situation. But I was lucky that my dad has audacity to talk to the smoker and told him about the consequences of smoking in public. Furthermore, smoking can harm high risk people such as baby, pregnant women, and old people. So that, smoker selfishness can leave a bad implications to those people. After that, Secondhand smoke causes stroke, lung cancer, and coronary heart disease in adults. Children who are exposed to secondhand smoke are at increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome, acute respiratory infections, middle ear disease, more severe asthma, respiratory symptoms, and slowed lung growth. So, if you are smoker, please avoid yourself from put your loved ones in danger. In conclusion, there is no need for us to question whether or not we need to ban smoking in the restaurant. It is a must and no one should question this action.
