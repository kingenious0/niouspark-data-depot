 	I agree with the statement which mentioned college students should have a part time job. About half of the college students are aged between 20 to 24 years old, at this age we should have the responsibility to pay our study fee without relying on our parents. Aside from that, most of the colleges are situated in the city which means high living costs for students to study over there. Thus, if one student is working as a part time job, he/ she can pay for his living expenses. Furthermore, students can spend their free time outside class with benefits activities such as working as part time job to gain their work experience to beautify their resume once they graduate. From the part time job, students can fulfill themselves with the common working requirements to better suit themselves in a new workplace. In addition, students may also gained experience on how to communicate with their boss and customers. While doing part time jobs, students are trained to have very strong time management skills to balance their work and study. Most of the company nowadays are looking for graduates with multitasking skills, thus, college students can trained themselves to be multitasking by working as part time job.
