In my opinion, I do not agree with the statement which is  It is important for college students to have a part-time job . It is because students will have a distraction on their study. They will get a busy routine in their daily life. Sometimes some of them will not attend the class. For an example, work as a waiter in a restaurant at night which 7 pm until 1 am and go back home at 2 am. It is very tiring and delivers them to skip the class which should be attended in the morning. The student will miss the lecture and get an unsatisfied result for the examination. Moreover, some of them also forgot to complete the assignments given by lecturers. It is because they did not aware of the task because they have two priorities in their life. On the other sight, some students need to do a part-time job to pay the fee for the college. They might come from poor families and they need to find money on their own. But it is not a reason for them to work hard for a part-time job because there is another solution for them to find the money. They can apply for any scholarship that is available out there or even applies for PTPTN and pay them back when they already working after finishing their studies. In a nutshell, it is not important for college students to have a part-time job because it will give bad impact on them in their life as a student.
