I am disagreeing on the statement. In my opinion, to have a part-time job or not is dependent on the student's financial situation, the effectiveness in time management and the passion in learning something new. As we know, the college's fees actually are not that cheap and not all students are able to pay for it. Thus, the students will try to find the ways to earn money or income in covering their study fees, living expenses and so on. Instead of asked money from parents or applied the scholarships, the easy way is finding the part time job for students to experience the real-time working environment and have some extra income. However, it is not necessary for a college student to have the part-time job if he or she is able to cover the expenses. This is because the main role of a student is to learn the knowledge and the skills to help them in future job. This bring to the second issue where the students are having a good time-management or not. The poor time management will bring a lot of negative impacts for the student with part-time job such as affected the academic assessment and mental health issues. For example, if the student doesn't manage the time wisely, he can't get enough sleep as he need to attend the class during daytime and work during night with non-stop. This will affect him in gaining the knowledge in class because he feels sleepy and can't focus on class, this will bring into the bad results and may fail the subjects. Thus, I think that it is important for the college student to focus on their main duty which is study efficiently in college to ensure they have the opportunity to get what they want in the future.
