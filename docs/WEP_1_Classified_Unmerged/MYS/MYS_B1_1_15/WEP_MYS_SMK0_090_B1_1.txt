 Smoking is a very terrible habit that affects millions of people annually and claims many lives. Numerous malignancies are brought on by smoking, which also permanently harms the human body. As far as I am concerned, I strongly agree that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. 

First of all, smoking at a restaurant might annoy diners, especially those who are eating. While others are dining, the smoker's smoking completely detracts from their mood. In general, smoking has negative effects on the health of those around you and is especially harmful to young children and the elderly. Bad ailments like cardiovascular conditions might readily affect others nearby.

Furthermore, setting a terrible example for the younger generations by smoking in public places like restaurants. Basically, young people copy the actions of the older generation, whether they are good or evil. If the elderly smoke, it sends a negative message to the younger generation. They will undoubtedly copy the harmful behavior if the smoker is their father, based on what they have observed..

Besides smoking puts a strain on a smoker's finances. The cost of a box of cigarettes, which contains 12 smokes, is very close to 20 Ringgit for a smoker. It demonstrates that a smoker will spend at least 100 Ringgit if they purchase one box for a week. Their money is being wasted on a horrible thing. Smokers' expenses are undoubtedly increased by their use of cigarettes. 

In summary, it is clear that smoking has negative repercussions on the smoker. Smokers are not the only ones affected, but everyone nearby is as well. In our nation, smoking should not be viewed as a non-issue. It is a bad event that could have a negative impact on everyone's health or possibly be fatal.
