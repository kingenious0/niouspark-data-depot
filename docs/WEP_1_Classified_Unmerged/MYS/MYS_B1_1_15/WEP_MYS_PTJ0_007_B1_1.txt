 In my opinion, I strongly agree with the college students about having a part-time job. 
The reason for my agreement is the college students can earn the money to pay for tuition fees or living expenses. Nowadays, many students can be the entrepreneur by staring up business on the social media. For instance, the products that can be sold are clothing, snack food or face mask. Some students also be the runner or admin of food delivery. This income will help those students who are facing financial problems, at the same time they can continue their education.
Furthermore, the second reason is that the student can gain working experience during part time job. Since college students will step into the real-life working environment after graduation, working as a part timer helps in earning more working experience which may be related to their major. From that point, the student can understand what their weakness is and how to improve their skills or personality to match the demands of the working space. 
Moreover, this is a good opportunity to expand the social circle while working as a part timer. If the college students are working as service crews or sales associates at the restaurant or gadget shop, they will have a chance to know the customer. Especially for the servicing career, the customers will always seek for help and the sales person has to provide long term service. Unintentionally, the person will gain trust from the customers and build a good reputation. Therefore, those college students will easily receive help or support perhaps they are facing difficulties or seeking job opportunities after graduation. 
	In short, I definitely agree with the college students to have a part-time job because they can earn some income, gain working experience and expand their social circle.
