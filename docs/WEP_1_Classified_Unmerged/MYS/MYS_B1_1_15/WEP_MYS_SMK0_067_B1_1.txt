      Yes, I agreed. Government should ban the smoking in the public place since a long time ago. Since few years ago, some restaurant harm their customers to smoking in their areas because it will affect others but many people ignore that warning. But on the other hand, some places are stand on that warning to care of other's comfortability. 
    Smoking should ban because of it will affect the smoker's health and people around them also. The smoke released will be around of people near them that will affect their health especially their lungs. There are many cases occurs in our country not because of they are smokers but because of smoke. The act that shown reflects the image and attitudes of someone. Smokers assume that smoking can release their stress without thinking of others and their health. 
    Smoke can damage the environment that can cause bad image of country. Many causes of bad environment and smoking are one of the main points. Day by day, the country does not have healthy environment as before because of the attitudes from the selfish person that ignore others' feeling and environmental of country. In addition, nowadays there are few types pf smoking that they use such as vape and it more dangerous than smoking. Users of vape not only use by adults but it commonly uses by students and it cause many problems to them. 
    In conclusion, smoking do not have any positive effect instead of negative effect. Many things that people can do to release their stress such as jogging or shopping. Self-image will reflect our attitudes and country that will judges from foreigner. Health has sentimental value and can not replace in any kinds.
