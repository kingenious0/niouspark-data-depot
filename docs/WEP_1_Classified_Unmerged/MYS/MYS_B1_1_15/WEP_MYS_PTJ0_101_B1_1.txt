 It is undoubtedly true for current students to have a part-time job to support their financial spendings. Majority of students have their own struggles to survive even though they have some educational loan provided by the government. However, due to the inflation that is rising up in most of the countries in the world, most of the students are facing financial constraint in managing their expenses to buy some stuff for academic purposes or even bills to pay monthly. 

I strongly agree for students to have part-time jobs. Obviously, they can reduce their financial constraints to spend their money on their commitments and have some emergency saving. Certain students own a vehicle either a car or a motorcycle. Fuelling up the gas could be a burden for a student to face as they surely need a vehicle to travel to work and go to class. Students should also prepare some amount of money for emergency purposes. As an example, the student might fall sick and require money to buy some medicine or pay the clinic bills. The medication bill is quite expensive but it is necessary for the student during an emergency case.
 
Lastly, doing a part-time job during studies can improve their soft-skills. They tend to meet different kinds of people everyday and it makes them improve their communication skills for them to use in the future. Moreover, they can improve their resume validity as they have gained some experiences in working during their studies. Therefore, it will make them extra beneficial to be hired in a great company due to their working experiences.
