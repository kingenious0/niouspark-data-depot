 I agree because smoking is not good for everyone around the smokers. Restaurants is an open place
for everyone from various level of ages. Cigarettes have bad ingredients that can give bad effects for
health especially that have sensitive antibodies or organ like baby and old people. For instance, the
smoke from the cigarettes can cause the babies will asthma or cough. It can be worse when it come
to dangerous diseases like heart disease, lungs disease, and also it can cause death. We called the
person who smelled the smoke is a second smoker. So, smoking can give bad effects not only to the
smokers. Typically, smokers didn't think about others health because it didn't give any losses to
them. But, to the family that involved with health problem that because of smoke, it is really bad
thing. How can smokers care about others whereas they didn't care about themselves?
Other than that, I agree to banned smoking in a restaurant because usually, restaurant is a place that
everyone spending their times with the loves like family. But, with smoke around, it can disturb
others with the smells, suffocated with smoke, and it will spoil people to enjoy the foods. Person
who smoking in the restaurants is a selfish because they enjoy with the cigarettes but the people
surrounding them is not comfortable with it. Additionally, smoking in the restaurants can cause the
restaurants dirty with the cigarette's leftovers. Normally, when they smoke happily, they just throw
it everywhere after finished it. So, I really agree to completely banned smoking in all the restaurants
because it didn't give any benefits to everyone.
