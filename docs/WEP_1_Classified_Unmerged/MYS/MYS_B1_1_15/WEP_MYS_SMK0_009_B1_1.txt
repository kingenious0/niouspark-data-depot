 In my opinion, I agree with the statement. Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. 

The first reason that smoking should be banned entirely is the smoke from the cigarette or electronic cigarette can danger human healthy. The components in the smoke such as nicotine and carbon oxide have been proved that can damage human organs. Carbon oxide could prevent the oxygen transferred by red blood cells throughout all the body which could damage the human organ cell such as brain cells which require a lot of oxygen to work. Besides that, nicotine could lead to lungs cancer. This is because the nicotine will stick at the surface of the lungs cell and cause the incorrect growth of the cells, then eventually lead to the growth of cancer cells.

Secondly, the reason that smoking should be banned completely is smoke will cause cough of the other customers in the restaurants. This is because the smoke from cigarettes is smelly, and it is unacceptable for most people. Then, the smoke might cause the difficulty in breath of the customers in the restaurants.

Lastly, another reason that smoking should be banned completely is smoke can make the vision of people in restaurant unclear. This is because the smoke from the cigarettes is tick and white which can prevent the people see the things in front of them, and then usually will cause the incidents.

In summary, the smoking should e completely banned a all the restaurant in the country because it brings a lot of disadvantage despite of bringing advantages.
