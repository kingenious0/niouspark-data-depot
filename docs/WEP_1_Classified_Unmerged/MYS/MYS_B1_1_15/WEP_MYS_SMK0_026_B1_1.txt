 Yes, we do agree with that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking can cause health problems such as cancer and many diseases on the respiratory system. This is because the cigarette is mainly made from nicotine and tar. The cigarette tar is the reason that cause us cancer since it will mutant our cells in our respiratory system. Besides, smoking in the public area like restaurants will also affect other people due to the gaseous releases from the people who smoke as known as secondhand smoke. Several studies had conducted and proved that the secondhand smoke is more harmful and dangerous than the cigarette due to the toxicity of the gaseous. In addition, the consumers in the restaurant not only adults but also children. Children has a weaker immune system as compare to adults, and they have higher possibility to be affected by the smoking gaseous. With that, smoking is prohibited in all restaurants in the country. Furthermore, smoking in the restaurant will cause a bad eating experience because the aroma of the food will be covered by the smoking odour. This will also lead to many negative impressions leaves in the comments of Google Maps and cause fewer customers to come to the restaurants. All in all, many disadvantages of smoking in restaurants had been justified above and it is clearly stated that we should banned smoking in all restaurants in the country.
