  A part-time job means working during free time. For university students, a part-time job means they need to work besides study time. There is always a fight about whether college students should have or should not have a part-time job. In my opinion, college students should have a part-time job. 
 The first reason I support university students having a part-time job is to gain experience. The experience gained part-time will greatly help their future career life. The knowledge that study in school needs practice to familiarize students with it. By working as a part-timer, university students have a chance to gain this experience before they start their careers. 
 Besides that, working as a part-timer can help university students earn some pocket money. As we know, now living cost is increase day by day but there are just few ways for university students to get money. For example, get pocket money from parents but not every parents able to afford their children living cost and study cost. Working as a part-timer can solve this problem as well. University students able to use the money they earn from part-time job to pay their study cost and living. 
 In conclusion, I fully support university students have a part-time job.
