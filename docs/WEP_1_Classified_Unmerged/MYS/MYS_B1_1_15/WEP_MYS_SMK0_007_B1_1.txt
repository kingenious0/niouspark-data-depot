 In my point of view, I agree with smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. 
First and foremost, smoking at restaurants can affect the cleanliness of the surrounding environment. From my observation, the smokers always simply throw cigarettes on the floor after they finish smoking. Sometimes, the ashes from the cigarettes will drop on the table covers and burn a hole on it. The smoke from the cigarettes contain tar which leading to the yellowish of white wall and furniture. This action causes the owners have to pay more to clean up the mess.
In addition, smoking also reduces the number of customers who are non-smokers visiting the restaurant. This is due to the unpleasant smell of smoke from cigarettes that can make someone feel uncomfortable and affect their appetite. Especially for those families who have children or elders, a smoking restaurant is the non-proper for them to visit. 
Lastly, smoking should be banned at all restaurants to protect the health and life of employees and customers. As a general knowledge, we know that smoking can cause lung cancer, infertility, and other diseases. Although the workers at restaurant might not smoke, they inhale the secondhand smoke will lead to these diseases too. Hence, after a long time working in this environment, the employees may be the victim. Sometimes, the ashes from cigarettes dropping on the flammable object can lead to fire disaster. Thus, smoking will threat the life of people at restaurant. 
Overall, smoking must be banned at all restaurants because it brings variety of side effects such as affecting the cleanliness of restaurants, reducing the number of customers, and threatening the health and life of employee and customer.
