 Nowadays, there are many people who smoke cigarettes regardless of age and gender. The
practice of smoking is not good. This is because smoking has many negative effects on our lives. The
question is, should smoking be banned in all restaurants in this country? In my opinion, I agree to
ban it completely in all restaurants in this country because it will have many bad effects on the
people around us. There are many negative effects on a person and also the environment as a result
of smoking.
One of the negative effects of smoking is affecting health. This is because the substances
found in cigarettes are dangerous chemicals. If a smoker or a person who inhales cigarette smoke
will be at risk of contracting a dangerous disease. For example, lung cancer, stroke, lung disease,
asthma and can also cause death.
Furthermore, smoking can also affect the environment such as air pollution. This means that
if a person smokes it will produce harmful smoke and it will cause pollution and the spread of
disease. This makes it difficult for us to find clean and fresh air.
Last but not least, the effects of smoking will also lead to fire. This is because there are
many irresponsible people who throw away cigarette butts while the cigarette butts are still burning.
This can cause a fire and it can contribute to an increase in temperature and the production of
carbon monoxide. Therefore, smokers must ensure that the cigarette butt does not burn before
throwing it away.
In conclusion, smoking is a bad habit because it can cause damage to body systems, health
problems and affect society and the environment. Therefore, all parties must join hands to
overcome this problem. If it is not contained it will cause this problem to become more prevalent.
