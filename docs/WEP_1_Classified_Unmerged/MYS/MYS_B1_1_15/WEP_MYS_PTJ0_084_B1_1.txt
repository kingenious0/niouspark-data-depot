 I agree because from the part time job, they can gain more new experiences. Nowadays, many
companies are looking for the employees especially fresh graduated with many of work experiences.
The college students that have part time job is easy to can get the job after graduated. It is because
they have a lot of work experiences like can give full commitment with studies and work and can
manage their times systematically. Most of them are more discipline either with the work time or
the task given. For employers, hired employees that have experienced is a one advantage for them
because they didn't need to teach the basic things that needed during work. In simple word, college
students that have part time job is an advanced for their future to find the job after graduated.
Besides, the college students are important to have part time job because it can help to reduce the
family's burden. It is more meaningful to the parents with low incomes and need to support all
studies things and other siblings. So, with part time job, at least the students can fulfil their daily
needs like pay their lunch and dinner using the salaries. For the better, the college students can give
the amounts of the salaries to their parents to support the family's income. With this, the family also
no need to worry about their children's money because they know that their children can afford for
it by themselves. I can conclude that having part time job for the college students can give many
advantages.
