I strongly agree that the smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. As we know, the cancer is the top three health issues in Malaysia and the main cancer disease is the lung cancer. The smokers in Malaysia are quite a big number where one of four people is smoker either active or passive. However, as the awareness in health issues especially the lung cancer has increased among the Malaysian, a lot of restaurants have restricted smoking or divide the areas for smoking areas. However, these actions still can't stop the people to get in touch with the smoke. For instance, the restaurants that have smoking areas, the chemicals from the cigarette or smoke will expose to the air and stick on the people clothes or foods. The people that not smoking will become the 2nd or 3rd passive smokers as they pass through or just walk by the areas. This is because the chemicals from the cigarette can stay longer in the air which about a few days and breath in by the people after this. These make the people still have the risks in lung diseases and I think the issues still not have been solved. Thus, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country to ensure the peoples can eat their food safe and healthy.
