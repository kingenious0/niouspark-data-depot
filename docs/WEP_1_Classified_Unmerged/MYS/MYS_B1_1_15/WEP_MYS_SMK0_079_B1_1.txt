In my opinion, I agree with the statement which is  Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country . It is because smoking give a large number of bad effects on people not even smokers but also the people in the surroundings. I am disappointed with smokers who smoke in front of babies. For an example, they smoke near a baby in a restaurant. It is such a rude and has no good manner kind of people. Baby is a sensitive human that really easy to get any kinds of diseases. The smoke from the smokers includes many types of bad ingredients like nicotine and tar. The baby will breathe in unhealthy air, which is the smoke that will enter their lungs that give a bad impact such as lung disease and asthma. Moreover, smoking should not happen in a restaurant as restaurant is a place where people eating and spending time together. It is not good for smokers to smoke because there is no good healthy air cycle. People just share the air and there will have a lack of oxygen as restaurant is a closed place. Smokers should be concerned with other people by taking action such as smoking at a place that is provided for smokers. The responsible party should warn them and give punishment if they still smoke in a restaurant. In a nutshell, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country to prevent people in the surrounding from getting serious diseases that come from the smoke.
