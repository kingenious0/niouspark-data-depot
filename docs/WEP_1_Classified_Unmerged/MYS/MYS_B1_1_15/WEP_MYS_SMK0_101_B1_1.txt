 
I totally agree that smoking should be banned completely at all restaurants in the country. The first thing should be raised upon this issue is the respect from the smokers to other customers. The smokers are considered very rude to other customers as the smoke produced is extremely smelly and disturbing. The customers are welcomed to enjoy their food comfortably in the restaurant but out of the blue the environment is spoiled by the smoke produced. It is a major turn off for most of the customers to spend their time in the restaurant. In this case, it would make the owner of the restaurant worse as they allow the smokers to smoke legally in their restaurants. Perhaps, they will lose some potential customers as it gives a bad impression or review from the other customers to the public. Moreover, the other customer will be considered a passive smoker. The passive smoker is a contradiction from the active smoker. However, the risk of exposure to lung cancer increases the same as the active smoker. It is really pathetic for the passive smoker as they do not have any relation to the cigarettes but still have the same risks to the active smoker.
