Should smoking be completely banned in restaurant in the country, as it should a long time ago. I completely 100 % agree with that idea. A person when they want to smoke, they can do it outside especially the restaurant is fully air-conditioning because it makes the smell bad. A smoking person sometime they just ignore that are a baby in that restaurant that will breathe with unhealthy air and it can bring affect to the baby. They also make the smoke near someone face and it kind of rude act. The cigarettes can bring dirty because at the end of cigarettes they are throwing it away with unproper way, this can make the worker at restaurant need to clean it up and make the extra work. A smoking person should be aware that people go to the restaurant is to eat in calm situation and to realize tension to get a fresh air and not to smell their smoking smoke. Smoking ca make the people are not comfortable to eat near them. Smoke from the cigarettes even they are not smoker they also can get the illness from it. The restaurant should be strict to punish a smoker who smoke in the restaurant and banned it.
