 I think I will say I disagree with the statement saying that college student to have a part- time job. I not agree with that idea is because I think the real job of a student is just to study and not making something like doing a job. Doing a job can make the students are not fully focus on their study. Being a college student is more tired like they need to completed the assignment and they also have a college program like marathon that they need to join. For me if they are become college student, they just need to enjoy to make a lot of memory being a student when they are still having this opportunity at young age. 
If you want to have a job just wait until you are graduate and after that you can working until you die and nonstop job. Being a student is different when you working.
 If you are studying and working at same time, it can possible you can burnout and stress. You will be having unhappy life and depress your selves. If student is working, they also can affect the sleeping hours of they are sleep. A part time job are usually at late night and offering a high salary that the student apply that job.
