I strongly agree with smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants because cigarette smoke is extremely dangerous for human health, especially for kids and elderly people. When there is someone smoking inside the restaurant, it is not only will cause air pollution to the environment in the restaurant, but it also affects the customer's appetite. When one is always inhaling the cigarette smoke, he/she have the high possibility to get lung cancer or tuberculosis. Sometimes not only the customers in the restaurant smoke but the workers also take this advance. Thus, it is consequently affecting the quality of the food and the restaurant's image. So, owners should strictly ban smoking to protect their customers' health and to avoid food poisoning problem to the customers. Government should take these issues seriously in order to make sure that the rate of health issues in Malaysia is lowest. There are some possible ways to solve the smoking issues including set an open area outside the restaurant for smoking, increase the price of cigarette, or totally ban smoking in the country.  The authorities shall know their responsibility to the others and make sure they can control themselves from smoking in the restaurant. The restaurant owner should collaborate with the government in banning this smoking issue.
