 Nowadays, the economy in our country is deteriorating. This has caused an increase in the
price of goods. As such, it has caused many people to experience difficulty in surviving, especially
among college students. The question is, is it important for college students to have a part-time job?
In my opinion I agree that it is very important for a college student to have a part-time job to make
ends meet. Part-time workers are workers who work on a contract with an employer. This is also
because there are many factors that make many college students have part-time workers.
Among the factors that cause many college students to have part-time workers is financial
problems. This is because college students need a lot of money to buy daily necessities and
homework items whose prices are increasing. PTPTN loan money borrowed by college students is
also not enough. This is because the money is used to pay tuition fees and books used to study.
Therefore, it is natural for college students to have part-time employees.
Next, among the factors of college students having part-time employees is to gain
experience. This is because many jobs require experience and skills. For example, doctors,
accountants, marketing officers and so on. Therefore, college students have part-time workers to
gain experience and indirectly gain knowledge about the work they are engaged in.
Last but not least is to fill free time. There are college students who have part-time
employees because they want to fill their free time during the semester break. This is due to too
much time not being filled with useful things. By having a part-time employee, it can increase
income and also experience.
In conclusion, it is important for college students to have a part-time job to get more
income, experience and to be able to fill their free time.
