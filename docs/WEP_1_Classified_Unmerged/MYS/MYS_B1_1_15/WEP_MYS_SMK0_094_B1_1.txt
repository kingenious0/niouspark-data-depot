 Nowadays, people take care of their health seriously. There are a lot of ways to maintain healthy and one of them is to stop smoking. But, although we do not smoke, the person who smokes will also affect our healthy. In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. 
As we know, when we stay beside the person who is smoking, the smoke will affect our health too. The smoke will come into our lungs and affect our respiratory system too. It may cause respiratory disease or lung cancer. Other than that, some people will headaches or feel uncomfortable if there is someone smoking beside them. We need to set up a law to protect their right because the smoker can smoke outside but it's impossible to let the customer takes the food and eat outside the restaurant.  
The second reason that we need fully banned at all restaurants in the country is to give the right to the restaurant owner to ban smoking in the restaurant. Some restaurant is an indoor restaurant. Smoking in an indoor restaurant will let all the customer need to have their meal in a bad air environment. By setting up this law, the owner has the right to protect other customer eating environment. 
In conclusion, I fully support that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country.
