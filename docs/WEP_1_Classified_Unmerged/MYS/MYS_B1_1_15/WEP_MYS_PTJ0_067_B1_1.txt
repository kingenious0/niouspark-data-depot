In the university life, many things that students should explore before going into the next life. Many advantages that students will gain if they do the part-time job but there are some parts that they should concern before they decide to do the part-time job. 
      Firstly, the advantages that students will gain from part-time job are experience and skills. Students learn how to be communicated with the people when they are in university and they can develop it into their part-time job. Nowadays, there are many types of job that students can do the part time job such as online business that do not require the high cost but only require the interest and skills.  From that, they can improve their skills and can gain more knowledge and experience.  Value of experience more expensive than education level . Some employer very concern of employee's experience before hire the employees, but it is not denied that education is important to teach students to gain knowledge and explore their skills. 
     Secondly, students will be more independent when they know how to earn the income for their living. Some students do the part-time job not because of they do not have enough money to pursue the studies, but they want to have the experience and feel the struggle to earn the income. In addition, students can create new relationship with others while exploring the new life.
