 Students are coping with challenges with their academic performance and financial burden in regard to specific university enrolment. Part-time employment is therefore a wise decision to prevent these problems from occurring. Personally, I think that college students benefited much from having part-time jobs.

First and foremost, a part-time job could aid students in covering their living expenses. This is because, on occasion, loans or scholarships like MARA or PTPTN are insufficient to cover a person's essential necessities. Just enough for each of these to cover their expenses.  Usually, when a new semester begins, the loan automatically reduces a costly fee for that specific semester. The students will be given the little balance to cover living expenses till the end of the semester. Therefore, the money earned from a part-time employment will aid students with their everyday expenses.

Next, working part-time will improve their communication abilities, particularly when dealing with consumers. My experience shows that doing a part-time job greatly assisted me in transitioning from an introverted to an outgoing personality. Students will develop their interpersonal skills by conversing with various consumers every day. Students that possess these qualities will also have mature life experience.

Another thing to consider is that a part-time job can definitely occupy students' free time with something productive. Students can have the possibility to meet new acquaintances from other professions by working a part-time job anywhere. This can help students think more critically and develop into wonderful friends. It may indirectly lessen the number of young people involved in juvenile criminality.

Based on these crucial factors, it is blatantly evident that a part-time work provides students with more positive outcomes than negative ones. Because it provided valuable experience prior to engaging in real-world work, students must seize this opportunity.
