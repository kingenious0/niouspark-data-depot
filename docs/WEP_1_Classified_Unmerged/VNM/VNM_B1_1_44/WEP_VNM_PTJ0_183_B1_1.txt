"With my perspective, i agree that college students should have a part-time job. It can be matched with your major or not, because it will bring lots of benefits for you. The first thing is money, absolutely, initial thought when decide whether or not to have a part-time job, however, we can gain more advantages rather than just having money. The second is having opportunity to practice and learn soft skill. When having a part-time job, we need to communicate with each others and practice makes perfect, communication not only the way we talk, but also the way we listen and sharing ideas to others. And, depend on which types of part-time job you have, it is an opportunity to learn something new (for example: bartender, sales person, tutor, â€¦).
Final thing is time management, although it just a part-time job but when we have something new in life, it will account a portion in a day, then we need to learn how to balance life if do not want to exhaust and stress. In conclusion, I think college students can take a part-time job, and think it like a chance for experience besides studying in university. "
