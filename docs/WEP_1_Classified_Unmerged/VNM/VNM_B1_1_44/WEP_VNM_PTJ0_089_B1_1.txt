"College students having part-time jobs while studying is very popular, and they do different types of work. Personally, I strongly disagree with this point.

First, it is not important for college students to have a part-time job, because some study programs are heavy, so balancing learning and working is essential. If college students can not balance it, they will get bad grades and will not absorb knowledge effectively. For example, I have a friend who works a night shift at GS25, and she always goes to school with a very tired face, she can not pay attention to the lesson, and most of the tests she gets a bad score. This proves that working part-time can negatively affect students' academic performance.

Another reason why I disagree with that point is that I believe college students should focus on research, improving skills, and getting internships rather than doing a part-time job. Part-time jobs take up a lot of time somehow, and the time spent studying is actually extremely helpful for your future. For example, my sister Thao Hien spent all of time in college studying and getting certificates, so she was invited to work at a famous bank for her excellence. This shows that investing time in education brings better career opportunities.

To conclude, I think that having a part-time job is not important for college students. As a freshman, I will study hard and do a lot of research to gain more knowledge, I believe it is a good choice. However, I really respect college students who have part-time jobs because of their hard work and strong determination."
