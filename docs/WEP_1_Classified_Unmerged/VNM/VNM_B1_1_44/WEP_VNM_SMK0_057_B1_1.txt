"Smoking has always been a controversial issue for many years, especially in fancy places such as restaurants. People think that smoking cannot be acceptable and should be banned in restaurants all over the country. In my point of view, I completely agree with this idea for several reasons.  
  
To begin with, smoking in general or cigarettes in particular are not suitable with the restaurants. Imagine that people surrounded by flowers, slow music, all together in a gentle and romantic atmosphere, then there was an unpleasant smell going on with white smoke. As a result, everything was broken by the smoking. People started to cough and all the food smelled badly. No romance and pleasant, all left was uncomfortable and mad, no one could stand this situation happily. Therefore, smoking is always banned in every luxury restaurants I have come to. Myself are also a person not into cigarettes and its smell, as a guest in a restaurant, I cannot accept there is any bad smell of smoking in that place.  
  
In addition, smoking also harms both people who use it and people who smell it. Many researches have shown that long term smoking could lead to lung cancer and other respiratory diseases. People who inhale toxic smoke from cigarettes will also be affected and diseases will gradually appear. Even though there are areas only for smoking, it still somewhat affects the atmosphere and guests' health. 
 
To summary, while smoking is still common throughout the country, I maintain my view that it should not be allowed in restaurants all over the country because of its negative effects on both restaurants and people using the service.  "
