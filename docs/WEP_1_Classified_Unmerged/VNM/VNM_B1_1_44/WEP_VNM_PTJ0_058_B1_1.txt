"In my opinion, it is not important for college students to have a part-time job. 

In my experience, some majors have massive deadlines for the college students to complete, and a part-time job can effect the quality of learning in college if students put too much effort into that part-time job. Besides, some information showed that in some situations, students paid too much attention to their part-time jobs instead of their learning, then received bad marks and had to pay more than their salaries to study again. 

On the other hand, the part-time job is not very positive. Students can arrange the part-time job if they are sure they can handle it without effect their marks in class and the part-time job can help their families decrease some of costs provided. Moreover, the part-time is also a way that helps us improve the soft skills like communication and lets the students know that money is not easy to earn. 

I prefer to get a job that uses the knowledge of my major or improves my skills for my future job to a part-time job. But it also bases on each person's situation, if they really need money to provide their life, so a part-time job could be a great way to solve that problem."
