Recently, the more of citizen needs the more of restaurants have been established. During of this evolution, there are more rules have been appeared in the restaurants. In my opinion, I totally agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned in at all the restaurants in the country for two main reasons.
To begin with, the mental health could be worse when smoking is more happen in not only the restaurants but also the country. Smoke can lead to many health problems. For example, the hospital have more patients in COPD. According to BNC news, the numbers of patients who have lungs problem have increases from 68 percent to 80 percent.
The second reason is that could be affect the people experience in the restaurants. During the evolution of modern life, there are more people who want to have a new experience also the service in the restaurant. So that, to create the most perfect service, the restaurants have to completely ban the smoke. For example, the five-star Michelin restaurant have shown the rule that people cannot smoke in the restaurant for 10 years.
In conclusion, smoking should be totally banned in at all the restaurants is the right decision to made to decrease the health problem and also to bring the best experience.
