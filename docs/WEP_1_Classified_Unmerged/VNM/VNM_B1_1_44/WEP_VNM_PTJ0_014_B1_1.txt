"Nowadays, some people suppose that it is significant for college students to have a part-time job. Personally, I totally agree with that opinion because of the following reasons.
First of all, I believe that part-time job is considered as a good opportunity for students to earn a living as well as pay their tuition fee. Some parents are rich and they could help their children with the tuition fee and a comfortable life when they are students, but some parents are not. Therefore, doing a part-time job not only help students get a better life when studying at college, but also help their parents decrease the finance burden.
Last but not least, doing a part-time job is also a good way for college students to practice what they have learned in the class. For instance, if a student majoring in Math teacher education, he could do a part-time job as Math tutor to apply teaching skills that he has learned, which improves his teaching and speaking skills as well as his major knowledge.
To sum up, I strongly believe that having a part-time job when being college students is necessary and should be encouraged because of the above-mentioned reasons related to paying tuition fee and having a good opportunity to improve their experience."
