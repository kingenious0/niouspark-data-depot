"I really agree that smoking should be banned at all restaurants! It is uncomfortable and unhealthy, not only for smokers, but for everyone around them.

When I go to a restaurant, I want to enjoy food and relax with friends. But if someone smokes nearby, the air smells bad, and the food doesn’t taste good anymore. Once, I had to leave early because someone was smoking next to my table. That was a terrible experience! Also, smoking is very bad for health. Secondhand smoke can make people sick, even if they don’t smoke. Children, old people, and people with asthma may feel worse because of it. Everyone has the right to breathe clean air when eating out. Some people may say it’s not fair to smokers. But they can go outside and smoke. That way, they can enjoy their cigarette and others can enjoy their meal. It’s a small action but it helps many people.

In my opinion, restaurants should be smoke-free. No one wants their dinner ruined by smoke. If smoking is banned, people will be healthier and happier."
