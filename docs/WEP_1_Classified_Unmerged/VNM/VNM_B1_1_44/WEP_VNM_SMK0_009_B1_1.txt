"In my opinion, I agree with this statement. I am a student who study in medical university, so I know that if someone smokes, not only he/she have a disease but also anyone who near he/she. 
The result of the smoke is really big, especially for pregnancy woman. The smoke has a bad effect on the fetus. It can make the fetus look strange and weird. For adults, you can have lungs problems such as asthma, lung cancer, etc. In the worst situation, you can die. That is why many doctor give an advice that we should prevent smoking. That would be so bad if you try not to smoke and keep yourself healthy as much as you can, but then, you go to the restaurant to enjoy your meal and you have to smell the smoke from another one. So that I think smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. Although it can make smokers annoying but they can smoke outside the restaurants. This action will have a big benefit for social health and the percent of lung diseases will also decrease after this action.
In summarize, I think smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country to keep everyone healthy and preventing lungs problems.
