"I agree that smoking should be banned in every restaurant in the country. The first and clearest reason is health. When one guest lights a cigarette, everyone else has to breathe the same smoke. My little sister once started coughing in a café because a man at the next table was smoking. Doctors call this “second-hand smoke”, and they say it can cause lung and heart problems almost as bad as smoking the cigarette yourself. That danger is simply unfair.The second reason is taste. A restaurant should smell like hot soup, fresh bread or grilled meat, not burned leaves. When smoke drifts across the room, even cold drinks pick up the smell, and the meal feels ruined. Even many smokers admit that tobacco hides the real flavour of food. If all places were smoke-free, people could really enjoy what they paid for.Money is the third point. Families with small children, people with asthma and many tourists choose clean air. Right now they often stay home or look for the few cafés with a no-smoking sign. If every restaurant were safe, these customers would eat out more, so owners would earn extra income.Some people say a ban limits personal freedom. But freedom stops where it hurts someone else. Smokers can still step outside, finish their cigarette, and come back in.Healthy air, better taste and more customers—these are three plain benefits that everyone can see. For these reasons I believe a complete smoking ban in restaurants is the right move for our country.
