"Nowadays, many college students still wondered ‘Is it important to have a part-time jobs?’. In my viewpoint, I think it is a challenging for students to have a part-time job when they still attend any school or studying and ‘time management’ is one of the answer for this question.
At the first course of first years when I’ve just a freshman at CTU, I have a part-time jobs, because my home economic was not really good, so I find a part-time job to have enough money for my personal expend. There was a time I worked more than 2 jobs simultaneously. And from that the problem was appeared, since worked more than 7 hours in days, so I didn’t have enough time to review the lesson after school or do the homework. That’s a reason why I got a bad mark for more than 2 subject because I didn’t finish the homework. Moreover, after study from 7am to 5pm on class, I have to work up to 0am every days, from that I didn’t have enough time to take a rest or sleeping. So, I always sleep every morning on class and can’t focus on the lesson. After one course, I noticed that because I wasn’t planned the timetable for study on school and part-time jobs become complexed.
The advice for any student, who still wondered that question is, if your home economics is good, please just focus on studying."
