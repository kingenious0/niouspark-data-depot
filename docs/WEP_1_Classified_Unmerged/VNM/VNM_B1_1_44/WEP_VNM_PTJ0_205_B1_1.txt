I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are a lot of reasons for that. First, college students can make money by theirself to pay for everythings they want and not depend on their parents. They don’t need a permission for concert ticket, a new phone, you can name it. College students will improve a lot of soft skills that needed for the future. These skills are comunication skill, team work, active listening, small talk. I think this is a bright thing in their resume. Second, when they have a part-time job, they know the value of money and how hard to make it so they will respect and use preciously. Third, they learn about how to plan to balance between learning and doing their part-time job. This skill is very hard to learn especially in the chaotic world right now, so if they can master this, they will have more advantange than the others that don’t have a part-time job . They will have more responsibility for the job future. Last but not least, part-time job is a great oppoturnity to learn and know who they are. It can help them to realize that their major choosen in 20s is suitable or not. If they know they have a wrong decision, they have a lot of time to change and conquer their dreams. This a privilege of having a part-time job in 20s. Conclusion, having a part-time job when you are a college student is essential and necessary.
