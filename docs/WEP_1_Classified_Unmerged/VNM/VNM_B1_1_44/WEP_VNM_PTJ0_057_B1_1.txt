"In recent years, getting a part-time job to pay for the cost of living in university has become more common. Many people agreed that students should be encouraged to have an income besides their family support. In my perspective, I partly agree with this statement for several reasons. 
 
On the one hand, it is the fact that earnings will help them in any emergency circumstances or save money for future plans. In negative ways, a person who lives in a poor family tried to work in order to continue their studies. There is a loan for college students to help them. However, they still need to get a job to pay for this. In positive ways, these students will have the saving for some important situations. For example, money to pay for medicines or fees for medical examine. Moreover, savings can help undergraduates reach their goals or chase their dreams. 
 
On the other hand, I also believe that this could cause a few barriers to their education. Firstly, focusing too much on that job will make students neglect and spend less time studying. For example, if a student goes to school and works on the same day, they will be tired and cannot study as planned. Overtime, they are unable to come up with classes. Additionally, few people think that working early is not only not helping for work afterwards, but also a waste of time and effort. Those jobs are simply life experiences without any work experience. Instead, concentrating on learning and gaining new knowledge would help better than working.  
 
In conclusion, I suppose that choosing to do a job is based on condition and desire. If students can balance between job and study, it will improve their basis skills and study path.
