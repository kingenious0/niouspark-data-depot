"In my opinion, it isn't important for college students to have a part-time job if it is not a job related to your major or helps you improve some necessary skills which you need to find a good job in the future.

There are many friends of mine who have a part-time job as soon as the first month we come to Ho Chi Minh for our college study. So what is the problem? Those jobs take much times from them, makes them can't focus to their study and make new friends in college. "It had ruined my college life!", sister Nhi said with me when we had a conversation on Teams to share about our slice of life stories. She found a cashier job for a bookstore near her dorm and worked very hard for this job. At the same time, she had many midterm exams and projects that needed to be done. She was absolutely burned out because of this and her first year's GPA was very low despite the fact that she wanted to take the scholarship so much. You can see that if you can't balance between working and studying, having a part-time job could become a nightmare in real life. If you just want to have some money for your personal needs, just focus on your study and take the scholarship. That is better for you than become a cashier or waiter in a restaurant or something else.

In short, I also think that a part-time job isn't important but if you can find a job that can help you better and better, give you things that you can't find at school, it will be fine."
