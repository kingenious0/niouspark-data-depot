I agree with the ban on smoking at domestic restaurants for the following reasons. Firstly, in the restaurant is a public place, there will be many people such as children, elected people, elderly people, adolescents, ... Smoking where these people will be dangerous for their health, especially for children and pregnant people, I often read newspapers so many children have serious diseases due to excessive inhalation of cigarette smoke. Second, if you want to smoke, you should go to separate areas for smoking, to avoid polluting the air around the dining area. Thirdly, the restaurant has a place that will be an outdoor space, some places will be a space in a closed room, if it is a space in a closed room, the smoke is really uncomfortable, with a person with a cough like me sometimes want to change the atmosphere of eating and drinking but it is disturbed by such smoke really tired in people. And the last reason the cigarette decay is very polluted, especially the eating place needs to always be clean and hygienic, if you meet people who unconsciously throw the cigarette butts, it will really be very unhygienic. So I think it should be banned from smoking in the restaurant to ensure the common living environment of everyone is comfortable
