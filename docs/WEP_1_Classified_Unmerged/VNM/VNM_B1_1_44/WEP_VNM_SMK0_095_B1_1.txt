"In today's world, the numbers of smokers are increasing rapidly. People smoke everywhere, in the park, in the museum, in school and even in the restaurant. In my point of view, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Here are several reasons why this policy should be applied to all the restaurants in the country.

The most crucial reason is to protect public health. Doctors said that the person who smells the smoke has more risks to have lungs cancer than the smokers. Because secondhand smoke are harmful and can causes serious health issues. A smoking ban in restaurant ensures a cleaner, healthier environment for the customer and the staff.

The second reason is it improves air quality and comfort. Non-smoking customer usually find it uncomfortable to eat in a smoke-filled environment. So a smoke-free policy ensures fresh air, making dinner experiences more enjoyable. Also cigarettes are a common cause of accidental fires so prohibiting smoking in restaurants will minimizes the risk of fire-related accidents.

The last reason is encourages a healthier lifestyle. Banning smoking in restaurant or public places will definitely discourage people from smoking and promote a better lifestyle especially among young people.

In conclusion, completely banning smoking in restaurants would protect public health, air quality, and a better lifestyle, giving both customers and employees a healthier environment. "
