"When it comes to this topic, my answer always is that I totally agree with this statement.

Cigarette, as I acknowledge, is really bad for our health, it can cause some severe diseases related to our lungs, brain or teeth, so on. Moreover, when a person uses cigarette in places where there are many people, its smoke can have a bad impact on the other people's health. 

And as I know, the negative impacts it causes to the people who use it and the ones who is unluckily influenced are nearly the same. It is not just that, when the smokers have their own family in the future, the diseases from the father or the mother that are created by smoking can influence the health of their son or their daughter then. Not just all the restaurants, I think smoking should be banned all over the world, for better human's health. 

What is more, the left of a used cigarette can be not beneficial for the environment. When people eat in the restaurants, seeing the used cigarettes on the floor or their smoke can make the feeling of their enjoying the meal become worse. Then, smoke or the left of the cigarette can go into the food and make them toxic and not healthy anymore.

In conclusion, I agree that we should ban smokers at all the restaurants."
