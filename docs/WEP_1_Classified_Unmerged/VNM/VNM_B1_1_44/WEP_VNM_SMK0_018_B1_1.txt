These days, many people have said that smoking should be totally prohibited at all the restaurants in every countries. In my opinion, I strongly agree with this idea for many reasons. Firstly, smoking in restaurants can bring discomfort to other people. The service industry have the responsibility to bring the best experience to their costumers. Because of that, restaurants have to eliminate any thing that distracts their costumers from enjoy the meals. Imagine that you are excited go to the restaurants for a delicious meal and then the cigarette smoke appears, you must be really uncomfortable in this moment. Furthermore, cigarettes are also harmful for people’s health. Minimizing risk factors for health disease is what restaurants should do to protect their guests. In the culture of every nations, smoking in the public place is considered as impolite. As a result, cigarettes should be forbidden in every public restaurants. Lastly, smoking in restaurants affects the quality of the brunch. People tend to eat less appetizing when exposing to cigarette smoke. Therefore, the quality and reputation of these service house can be affected seriously. In the worst case, customers will leave the restaurant and do not return again. In conclusion, I totally agree that cigarette smoke must be completely eliminated from eating places in every nations around the world.
