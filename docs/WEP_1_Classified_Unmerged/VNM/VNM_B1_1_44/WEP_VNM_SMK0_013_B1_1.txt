"In my opinions, I agree with “Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.” There are some reasons:
Firstly, in the restaurants have a lot of customer. It’s about: children, woman, old people even people have bad health and so on. It’s really harmful for inhaling cigarette smoke especial smoking. Smoking for a long time, they can have pulmonary disease such as: COPD, cough and so on. That’s terrible!
Secondly, smoking can be addicted so the man who is main worker. They will pay all the money to buy cigarette in restaurant so that they don’t have enough money for their families. The children don’t have meals that they want to eat, the wife don’t have money to take care of families. The husband becomes a rude person. There are a lot of arguments in their life. The children grow in unhappy families, they will be shy, unconfident. It’s really a hard problem in social.
Thirdly, smoking in the restaurants is also dangerous for children who do lots of activities because they run, play together, they don’t carefully. Maybe, they touch cigarette lighter, throw it or did something that make cigarettes lighter explore. 
However, smoking can help people to relax when they have stressed. It’s also a special needed of people. If we ban smoking in all the restaurants in the country, the customers will be decrease. It is affected to sales in the restaurant.
Finally, I still agree with should not smoking in all the restaurants in the country."
