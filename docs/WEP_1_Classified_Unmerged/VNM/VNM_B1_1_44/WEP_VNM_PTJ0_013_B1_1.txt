"Now day, ""it is important for college students to have a part-time job "". In my opinion, I agree for some reasons.
Firstly, college students have a part- time job such as: service, PT in gym center, teacher and so on. I think they choose a part-time job because it is convenience for balance between studying and working. It’s don’t take too much time, it’s about 2-3 hours a day for job and then they can spend all time for hanging out with friends or studying in coffee.
Secondly, the money they have from working, it’s helped their family economic. For examples: they study in school which has high prices so that parents have to borrow from bank or relatives. So, college student should have a part time job to reduce hard in their family and their life.
Thirdly, having a part time job is also necessary cause they can get not only experiences from working environment but also relationships. That’s great!
However, having a part time job also have bad things such as if you want to find a lot of money, you have to spend a lot of time, so you don’t have time for studying. Your mark is falling even you can fail in tests at school. It’s really bad. Sometimes, in your working environment maybe you can work with toxic peoples. It’s really hard for keep going with job and you don’t feel happy anymore.
Finally, I agree with “It is important for college students to have a part-time job”, but college student have to balance studying with working because studying is most important mission."
