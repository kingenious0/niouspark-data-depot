"In my opinion, I disagree with this statement. I am a college student and my major is dentistry. I spend my time almost at school and study. In my major, I think spending time for study to improve your knowledge for future is better than have a part time job. 
If I have a part time job, that will be mattress, online seller or working at coffee; this job is not related to my major and career in the future. Because now I don’t have enough knowledge to be a dental. Therefore, if I have a part time job, the only benefit is having money. But the drawback is I don’t have time to study and if worst, I won’t have job in the future. I think have part time job or not depend on which major you are studying at. If you can have a job that related to your major, so part time job is suitable for you. But if not, you should prefer on your studying than making money. 
Don’t just see the little benefit right now, you should have a plan for a long time for your future. If you have part time job now, you can have money. But you spend time for studying now, in the future you can make a lot of money than that.
