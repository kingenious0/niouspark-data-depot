Personally, it is essential for students in university to get a part-time job but also focus on their study. Nowadays, the undergraduated students often get a part-time job as soon as freshmans. Because, it could help them not only pay money on their own daily but also get more experience. The amount of money they earn from their job could help them pay tuition and other expenses which they could live independently to their parents . Furthermore,  having a part-time job is a part of learning something news, getting out of your comfort zone and having more valuable experience from their job. Some students from last years often work at the company they want to work in the future to gain experience and also repair for their future work. However, there are some adverse effects of part-time job that can affect their mental and physical health. They may put lots of efforts on earning money rather than studying that can lead to bad marks and miss the class as they do not have enough energy and well-being for the class and also time to prepare for the lectures. And they may get out of university soon due to the large amount of money they get. Thus, students in college should balance between a part-time job and study as they could get more money after graduating.
