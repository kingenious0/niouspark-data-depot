"Some people suppose that it is significant for banning smoking at all the restaurants in the country. Personally, I totally agree with that opinion because of the following reasons.
First of all, I believe that smoking at the restaurants is not good for their own health as well as the others around there. For example, we can easily recognise that smoking is one of the primary reasons leading to lung cancer and many serious diseases via news as well as social media. Therefore, banning smoking at all the restaurants or even at other public places in the country is vital to ensure that people can get a more comfortable environment and healthier life.
Moreover, it is important to prevent people from smoking at all the restaurants in the country because the smell of it could make some people annoyed as well as uncomfortable. To illustrate, imagine we are enjoying the delicious dishes in a modern restaurant with our family. Suddenly, we recognise a terrible smell of smoking and it makes the air uncomfortable and difficult to breathe. What do you think at that time? 
To sum up, I strongly believe that banning smoking at all the restaurants in the country is necessary and should be encouraged because of the above-mentioned reasons.
