"I agree. Nowadays, it’s good for college students to have a part-time job, it helps them learn more about society and gain more knowledge and experience. They’ll earn lots of things, not only earn the money they did and also experience where they worked, maintain their skill and time management skills.
Firstly, Working Environment. They will interact with lots of people out there and they have to solve the problem and do their job base on where they are working, also they need put their attitude on their jobs, so they can approach more the chance to improve their skills and their relationship. 
Secondly, time management, they will make their own schedule for the week, to make sure the schooling time does not match the part-time job and they must focus when they study. It is ridiculously hard when you cannot manage your time correctly cause just one mistake in your plan yours studying could be ruined. 
Third, when we all manage the time, you can do any part-time job while studying, it helps you maintain your skills and your relationship, your study as well.
After all, we all need a part-time to earn some money and knowledge out there, it will help us someday."
