"I agree with the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, but not even at restaurant, smoking should be banned on bus and especially among pregnancy and children. 

Most of us know that smoking is not good for our health and people among us. Therefore, smoking in a restaurant can make a bad effect to other guests and their experiences in meal, the scene and flavor of the food could be change as well. Moreover, some people go to the restaurant with their families, their partners, their kids so smoking be banned is a good way to prevent bad effects to people's health. People who smoking can be more responsible about their acts in restaurant, among people which is includes child and maybe pregnancy women. Plus, the rules can make people decrease their smoking, at least in the restaurants and that somewhat can help to ease the risk of smoking to their and others' health.

Nowadays, some countries have not completely banned smoking in all the restaurants, for example is my country â€“ Vietnam. It has created a lot sickness for our people and has decreased the age of people in that country. I hope smoking should be banned in all countries, not just in the restaurants but in all places and should prevent smoking for the best."
