In this modern word, perspectives of smoking at the pubic places are become popular and understandable. The idea of Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in my country is still stricky. I am going to discuss these views according to position and my personal. First of all, smoking is accepted for a long time in Viet Nam. You can smoke when you become a 18-year-old person, depend on the background you are in. However, when you are in the restaurant, the place that people come here to enjoy their time. When you smoke, you can annoy the guest by the smell. Someone cannot stand the smell, they allergy and become worse health condition. Secondly, when pregnant women or children are in the restaurant, you should not smoke because it affects their health, food and their feeling while they enjoy the atmosphere. Finally, restaurants in Viet Nam are the place many foreigners visit and think about our country that why you should not smoke and demonstrate bad behaviour in front of them. The foreigner will assess us and then, they come back to their country and tell something shameless about Vietnamese people. In conclusion, I cannot complete agree or disagree about smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It depends on your country and the way other people are judging you.
