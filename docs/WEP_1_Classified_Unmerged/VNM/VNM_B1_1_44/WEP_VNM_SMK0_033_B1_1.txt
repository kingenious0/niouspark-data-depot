"Some people argue that there should be a ban on smoking at all restaurants in the country. From my point of view, I totally agree with this idea with this discussion as now will be discussed.
The first reason is that there will be a lot of health benefits for the public. To clarify, banning smoking in restaurants protects non-smokers from secondhand smoke, which is known to cause various health issues, including respiratory problems, heart disease, and cancer.
This helps to reduce the risk of having these issues. Additionally, many people avoid restaurants that allow smoking due to the unpleasant smell and health concerns. Therefore, a smoking ban can attract a larger customer base, including families with children and health-conscious individuals.

Another point is that it can increase public safety. The main reason for this is that eliminating smoking ensures that the indoor air quality in restaurants remains clean and healthy for both patrons and staff. Moreover, smoking poses a fire risk, especially in enclosed spaces filled with flammable materials. Banning smoking can reduce the likelihood of fire incidents in restaurants.

In conclusion, banning smoking can be beneficial to the country.  As such, I strongly agree with the idea that there should be a ban on smoking at all restaurants in the country.
