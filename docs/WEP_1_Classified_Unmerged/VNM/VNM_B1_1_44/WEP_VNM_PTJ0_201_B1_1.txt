"Many students choose to work for a part time job even thought they know it could be bad for their grade in their university. However, we can not refuse that part time job can help some students especially in their financial abilities. I strongly agree that it is important for college students to work in their free times.
First, students can earn money in their free time. In fact, they have a lot of free time after school instead of spending time on their phones, they can work in a coffee shop, online job or help their teacher in school,â€¦ That money can facilitate them to pay on their bills, books, foods which can reduce their parents pressure. Moreover, it build the responsibilities for the students to their money and feel more independent to decide to manage their time.
Secondly, part time job give students work experience. They can work directly with customers that they can face some problems need critical thinking. They can also learn how to communicate efficently with their team so they can collaborate and support each other. There are a lot of jobs that require teamwork, so they can share their idea, support their team and ask question to improve their working place.
In conclusion, working on  free time can aid students financially and learn more useful skill. It also helps them more responsible, independent and develop their future careers. Therefore, I strongly agree that part time job can bring back some beneficial for their student profile and professional growth.
