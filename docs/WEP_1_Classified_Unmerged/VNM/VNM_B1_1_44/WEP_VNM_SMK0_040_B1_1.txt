Smoking is killing ourselves it doesn’t bring any good effect for us meanwhile it is burning our lung down so bad, and contains addiction for who smoking for a long period, and research for smoking is up to 80% people got cancer by smoking because in the cigarettes contains nicotine harming our lung cause cancer. Smoking of cigarettes can make the others people feel so annoy and uncomfortable, moreover it could made cancer when people sniff it, and it is very bad for children when they interact with the smoke, they feel sick or struggle when they sniffed. And it unbelievably bad for the environment, they just continue to throw the leftover of the cigarettes everywhere on the street, park wherever they go, and the packet of cigarettes was not cheap, but people still spend on it while they know it doesn’t bring any good for themselves. In the restaurant, the food was cooked but the smoke of the cigarettes ruins the disk it brings bad experiences when you taste the food. Make the space more toxic and annoying.
So smoking should be completely banned everywhere not only the restaurants, the environment will become more fresh and nobody get cancer.
