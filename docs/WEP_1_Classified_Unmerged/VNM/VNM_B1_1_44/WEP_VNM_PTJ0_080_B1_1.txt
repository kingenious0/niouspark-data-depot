"In my point of view, global is more and more modern and the economy is increasing rapidly. Therefore, many students want to earn money when they are in college or university. But I think it is not crucial for college students or students who learn in university to have a part-time job because of these following reasons. 

Firstly, when they have a job, they cannot have enough time to do their assignment and homework, so their marks will be low. Moreover, they cannot review their lessons at school so that when they have a test or final test, they cannot have a good mark, or maybe they cannot finish their courses and have to attend that course again. And if they attend again, they have to pay money for those courses again. So you can see that it is time-consuming and does not have any benefits. 

Furthermore, when they have a job, maybe it will affect their health because they have to work and study together, they do not have enough health and maybe they will lack sleep. So that they always feel tired, stressed or do not have energy to do anything. Last but not least, when they do a part-time job, they will meet a lot of customers and maybe they will make them feel uncomfortable or stressed. 

In conclusion, I think students in college or university should not do a part-time job because it does not bring any benefits for them. I think we just have part-time jobs when we have a lot of spare time and make sure that it does not affect to your life."
