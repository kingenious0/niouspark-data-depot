"Some people believe that having a part-time job is good for students, but in my point of view, having a part-time job can give students some disadvantages.

Firstly, when they spend a part of their day in working, they cannot contribute well to their study work. Sometimes, spending too much time in their part-time job can make their marks at their university become worse. 

Secondly, they may not take care of their health well when they not only work but also study at the same time. Day by day, it is possible that they will not sleep for enough amount of time and eat properly. Then, both their health and their study work will gradually decrease. 

However, in the other hand, having a part-time job can help students make some money to pay for food, their tuition and so on. In the case that their family condition is bad, it can make their life somewhat more pleasure.

In short, in my opinion, students can have a part-time job, but it should be in the period when they are third or fourth year students. It is a good time to start working but they should invest their time in the jobs that are advantageous for their majors."
