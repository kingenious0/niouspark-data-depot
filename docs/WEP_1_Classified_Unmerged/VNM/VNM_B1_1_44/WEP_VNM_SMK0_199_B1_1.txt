From my perspective, I strongly believe that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because of the following reasons. First of all, smoking is not only a harmful activity for the person doing it, but also for the people around them. Some people smoke to satisfy themselves, but this can seriously affect the health of non-smokers. Breathing in smoke can make other people sick, especially children or people who have problems with their lungs. Everyone should be able to eat in a clean and safe place. Secondly, smoking makes the restaurant smell bad. When someone smokes, the smell stays in the air and on the furniture. This can make the food taste worse and make other people feel uncomfortable. If a restaurant smells like smoke, many people will not want to come back. For example, one time I went to a restaurant and the person next to me was smoking. I didnâ€™t enjoy my food because of the smoke, and I left early. I never went back to that restaurant again. Finally, banning smoking helps make restaurants better for everyone. It helps people live healthier lives and shows respect for other customers. In conclusion, smoking should not be allowed in restaurants because of its negative effects. A non-smoking place is better for everyone.
