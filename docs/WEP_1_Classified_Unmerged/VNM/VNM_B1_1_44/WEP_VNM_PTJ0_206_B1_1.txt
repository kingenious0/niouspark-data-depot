"Nowadays, many students form colleges and universities had part-time job. Personally, I agree that it is necessary for student to experience in working market in their school time.
Firstly, working can help undergraduates to be financially independent, which is especially important in todayâ€™s world where the cost of education continues to rise. It is true that many students now are facing challenges, such as paying tuition fees, buying textbooks or managing daily expenses like food and transportation. Therefore, earning money allows them to cover these cost and reduce the financial pressure on their family.
Secondly, part-time job gives students a big chances to experience and develop skills. Instead of only learning academic knowledge from college, they can put themselves in real labor market. As a result, they can learn how to communicate efficiently or to actually do teamwork, which facilitates them to apply for full-time job after graduation.
However, it is important for students to maintain a balance between work and study. Separating time appropriately can help them ensure neither their education nor their job performance suffers.
In conclusion, having a part-time job can be very beneficial for college students as long as they manage their time wisely. It prepares them for the future, both financially and professionally."
