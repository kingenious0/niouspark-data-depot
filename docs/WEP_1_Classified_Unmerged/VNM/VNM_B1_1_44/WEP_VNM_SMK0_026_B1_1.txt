"In my opinion, I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
At the restaurants, there are so many kind of customers and none of them want to smell the smokes, imagine that you come to the restaurants after a day of working hard or for a first date with someone you met online to enjoy the meals, then suddenly an old men next to your table start to smoking and all the smoke came to your face and haunted you like a ghost, that would destroy your day. People come to the restaurant to eat, not to smell the smoke around them. Smokes would affect the meals and people can’t eat, its also caused many problems so they should banned smoking or give them a smoking rooms.
Smoking is a bad habits and its caused lots of illness and problems, not only for the smoker but also for people around them. To be honestly, I do smoking for 4 or 5 years, I’m trying to cut off that habits but somehow I just can’t. I only smoke in the place that allowed and has no kids around, and specially I’ve never smoking at the restaurant because I don’t want to ruin anyone meals like I don’t want anyone to ruin mine."
