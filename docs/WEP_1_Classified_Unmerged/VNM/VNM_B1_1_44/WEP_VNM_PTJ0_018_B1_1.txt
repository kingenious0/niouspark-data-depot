These days, college students tend to have a part-time job for many reasons. In my opinion, I agree that it is essential for them to work out beside school time. First of all, working in a part-time job can help them charge for their need at university life. In some family with difficult economic condition, the job can also help their parents lower the burden for their study and lives. For instance, many universities in Vietnam require high tuition, so part-time job is the best way to help students and families to earn extra income to pay for the tuition. Furthermore, having part-time job is a great chance for college students to experience more soft skills. During their work, they must learn to be patient, learn how to communicate and treat well with others. They also have to solve any problem that happens in every situation, which brings them a lot of experience in their future work. Lastly, working part-time is a great opportunity to meet new people and have more relationship. When students join new work, they can have a chance to do the job with many kind of people in the society. Thanks to this, they can experience more ideas, and learn how to work with anyone they meet. In conclusion, I agree that having a part-time job is also a great choice of college students, if they can allocate time appropriately.
