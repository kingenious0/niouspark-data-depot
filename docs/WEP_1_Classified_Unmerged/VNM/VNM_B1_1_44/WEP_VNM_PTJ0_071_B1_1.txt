"I agree with the statement "It is important for college students to have a part-time job" because of these reasons.
 
Firstly, students can learn soft skills from the part-time job such as communication skill, teamwork skill, solving problem skill, … Students cannot learn these skills in the school because many schools in Viet Nam teach more about academic knowledge than about practice skills. Having a part-time job is a great way to learn and practice these skills.  

Besides that, students can have experiences for their major. For example, a student learns the major of Information Technology, this student can do the jobs like writing programs, designing game, … and when this student wants to apply a technology company, the jobs which he/she made will become the good points for him/her toward the interviewers. 

In addition, they can make new friends, have the relationship with the people who have experiences in the fields of students. Students can have some money from their part-time job, and they can use them to pay for the fee if they can not have the scholarship. Some jobs can help students earn much money, especially the jobs about technology. 

In short, college students should have part-time job to enhance their skills and experiences about the major."
