"As an medical student, we figured out many problems to health when smoking or inhaling in the poisonous atmosphere with smoking around. So that I strongly agree with the opinion that the local restaurants should publish some rules preventing the customer from smoking.
Smoking is always the big issue in the lengthy period time. The chemicals in smoking damage your respiratory system especially the lungs and alveoli. The nicotine in smoke can obstruct your airway could lead to lungs cancer, hard–breathing and moreover. It’s dangerous not for only the smoker but could attack your family, friends, and people around them. COPD – chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases is often appears on the people smoking very much. It take your energy down, and could make you need some hard treatments to cure. Unfortunately, the children and the elder have the weak body to manage if they faced with the problems. The restaurant’s environments are the place for families to choose for entertaining, gathering so smoke is one of the dangerous threats to them. But when they exhale and inhale in this polluted environment could endangered them. So that the restaurant should get some solution to handle this problem. They can use signs “No smoking” around the restaurant to enhance their thinking how smoking could be harmful for everyone. Moreover, the smoking place could be necessary for customer who want to take some. But smoking should be banned in the restaurants to protect people more efficiently. 
Smoking shouldn’t prevent us to take the qualified time with families and friends. Especially in the restaurant – a good choice to relax and gathering. The restaurant’s manager and their waiter might inform the customer about the smoking rules of restaurants before the clients enjoy the meal without making any annoying to other people because of their smoke."
