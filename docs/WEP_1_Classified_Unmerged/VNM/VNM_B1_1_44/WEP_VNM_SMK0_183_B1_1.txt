In my point of view, I strongly agree with the statement: smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. The reasons for this are varied, but can be explained in some main points. Firstly, in perspective of public, restaurant is a public place, not only man and women come, it also baby, pregnant women come. And as everyone know, smoking bring many harm for other people, but extremely harm for that group. If someone wants to smoke, they need to smoke in separate places. Secondly, as a owner of restaurant, i am not welcome client who smoke because their behavior have negative impact for other client and affect atmosphere, decoration of my restaurant. For this two main reasons, if the government can ban completely smoking in the restaurant, i will very appreciate this. It will be a foundation to expand the ban in broader, for example: in road, supermarket, public toilet,â€¦ give more clean and fresh atmosphere for every people. However, cigarettes is an inelastic goods, and the consumer of this is extremely large, if the government want to apply this policy it will be hard and take time.
