"In my opinion I totally disagree with this statement - students studying at colleges or universities do not have to have a part-time job. 

Firstly, it is because each university has different syllabus so that having a part-time job is optional. If the students in that university can manage their time well, they can find the part-time job to support their family. 

Secondly, being important about students must have a part-time job could be make them under pressure and make them receive bad result at school because they cannot pay attention perfectly on their studying. 

Moreover, the ability to manage time of each people is different so it is do not suitable when said that "It is important for college students to have a part-time job.". For example, the student who can manage their time well, and can solve their homework in a brief time can have more time to do other things and more than people. Working overtime also makes an adverse consequence on student physical health and mental health. 

So that, a part-time job is just an option for students who want to have money to support their life or family, if the student has enough money for their living standard they should focus on their study, physical health, and mental health."
