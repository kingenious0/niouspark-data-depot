" Whenever someone talks about college students and part-time jobs, tone of conflicts will start to appear about should or shouldn’t they have one, and from my point of view who already have searched for part time jobs since first year of college, I will say yes without dout and here are why.
Firstly, we discuss money, which is a key force that manipulates many aspects of modern human life. By working, you can use your own strength and energy to create values in the form of money, which you can use to pay for your daily expenses and occasionally to support your family. However, this is not always the case because, in contrast to full-time jobs, part-time jobs often require shift work and don't always pay well. Students who work for food and beverage establishments or lack experience will receive between 12,000 and 25,000 VND. If they wish to make more money, they must work almost full-time, which may not be realistic given their academic schedule. 
The next important component is getting real-world experience, as attending college only imparts academic knowledge; we also need to be able to deal with the whole range of scenarios that may arise in our future employment. Additionally, working for facilities connected to our major will be a terrific opportunity for our resumes. Last but not least, the individuals we meet and become friends with at work are likely to be able to assist us in the future or in other ways.
In conclusion, working part-time can be a terrific opportunity for all of us to build the experience, relationships, and money we will need for the future, despite it can limi time with our families or studying. In my opinion, college students who wish to remain in the campus environment should work part-time jobs.
