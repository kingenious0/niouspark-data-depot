"The student’s time is the great period for student can have more wide aspects about their jobs and future. They can intend some practical activities in or outside school including volunteering, have more internships in some local companies that links with their faculty. For some reasons, I find that working part-time jobs could be more helpful to find the interests and improve your skills before graduating but this isn’t obliged for all to get temporary jobs.
                                                                                                                                               First, working as a part-time employee can lead to more opportunities to meet the seniors, and the colleagues. We can acquire from them some experiences when they work full-time. Learning about the advices before having a decision what and where we are going to do so you can figure out the way to get your career better. Second, getting experience by yourself in this jobs would get you a closer look about your career, working environments, colleagues, the service at office. And what you are going to be had after the jobs. But in the opposite side for this discussion, this jobs could take you a slightly bit of time to handle. Especially, in majors has the large information, content and time having to learn, the difficulties in maintaining the workload and the studying are harder. The more time you spent on the part time jobs, the less time you spent on you college. So that you can choose another way being note need you to spent time such as working volunteering, doing some practical activities at school. 

Part time jobs is the good way for the students to get realistic in the job but you can choose more way if you want to have a more clear experience about what you are going to do in your future. "
