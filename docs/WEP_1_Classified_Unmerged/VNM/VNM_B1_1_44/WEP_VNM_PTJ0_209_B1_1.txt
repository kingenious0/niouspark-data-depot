     In my opinion, college students only do a part time job when they in the 1st year. Because at that time they have more free time before study a lot of major subject in the 2nd and 3rd year. College students can gain more experience in outside the school. Beside that, they also can make and earn money to help their parents. As a college student, I realize that I can work with almost types of people at the restaurant I worked. Not only with the colleague but also with the difficulty customers. That will help they learn more about communication skills, time management, and how to address with the situation they met. They also have more relationships and someone of them can be your coacher in the future. That are some positive side of getting a part time job. They must remember the important of studying because the money they earn and the time they work for that job can not pay for the subject at university and that will make their parents unhappy. In summary, I think there are more ways to gain these experience like join a club at university but have a part time job will help college students discover more side at the social life.
