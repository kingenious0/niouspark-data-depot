"Some people say that smoking should be entirely prohibited in all the restaurants across the nation. I agree with this opinion because the impact of smoking can be lead to some of health problem. For example, if a children stay in a place with crowded smoking-air, a long time after the respiratory disease will appear and threat to kid’s health. And if you don’t smoking, you also get many kind of sick relate to respiratory disease if you sniff the same atmosphere with person who smoker. Not only the person who sniff, but the person who smoker also get the problem with their health. And my story is an example, I live with my father-a smoker. After a long time, ling with him I have a respiratory infection, even though I wasn’t smoking. In my viewpoint, I think people should take the consequences for any things they do, don’t affect others. And you also feel uncomfortable when you hate the cigarette smoke, but you have to sniff it when you come to a restaurant to enjoy your meal. So banned smoking at all the restaurants in the country is the most effective way to protect our health and contributes to reducing respiratory diseases.
