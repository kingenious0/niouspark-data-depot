"It has become quite common for college students to have a part-time job to either another one concentrate completely in their major. This essay will discuss about the positive and negative aspects that arise with this trend. 
On the one hand, it is crucial for college students to have a part-time job because you can earn money by yourself, improve skills such as communication, learning new things byself and your ability of time management. For instance, when you are in the age of peer pressure, having a job helps you to espouse your values, it such as your first successful things of your life. It also brings many additional benefits such as you can take care of yourself, save money before you get an official job. Moreover, you should have a part-time job if you want to be a patient one, cause you have to solve many service’s problems.
However, from my viewpoint, if you want to be talented in your major. You should spend almost of your time to study, explore the knowledge of your major at school (by read new researchs, review lesson after you finish the recent class and discuss with your friend about the way how to become professional). Additionally, you should not have a part time job when you are still in the college, it wastes your time. You can spend time with your families, do your hobbies and travel around the world. 
To conclude, I believe that while this trend does bring some benefits, overall they are definitely outweighed by the drawbacks. You should think about it carefully before you decide to have a part-time job when you still at school."
