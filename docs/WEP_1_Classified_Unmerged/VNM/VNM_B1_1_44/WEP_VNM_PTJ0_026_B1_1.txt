"In my view, I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part time job.
Some college students had used to be take care to much from their parents and they don’t know how to depend on themselves, so take a part time job as soon as you can is a good way not only to earning bonus money but also to get yourself so many experiences from people.
On the other hands, getting a job can distracts your studying a lot if you don’t know how to balance your schedule. So many of my friends they were so into the job and the salary so they decided to quit their studying. After that, they realized that wasn’t the right choice, they don’t have chance to have any better job for their future without the degree, and I see it was the hard time for them choosing between studying and working.
Like I said, have a part time job is good to training yourself but you have to think carefully, I don’t say that you cannot have any good job without the degree but It would be harder and need so many of experiences. So whenever you feel that your job take so many times from you and you cannot study well, you might quit that job and pay attention to your study. "
