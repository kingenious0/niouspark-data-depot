"I think smoking should not be allowed in restaurants because of these reasons:

First, smoking is bad for your health. If people smoke in restaurants, other people also breathe the smoke. This is not fair for people who don't smoke because it can make them sick.

Also, smoking makes the restaurant not nice. The smell of cigarettes is not only very strong and it can make food taste but also contains many toxic components that cause many respiratory diseases, eventually cancer. If there is no smoking, the place is more clean and fresh, so people will enjoy food better. A smoke-free restaurant ensures a comfortable atmosphere where everyone can fully appreciate their meals.

Many countries already ban smoking in restaurants. This is good because it helps people to stay healthy. If our country also does this, it will be better for everyone. People who want to smoke can go outside, so they don't make other people uncomfortable.

So, I think smoking should be banned in all restaurants. It will help protect health, make restaurants better, and is good for all people. Making people stay a healthy lifestyle and our community will be cleaner and fresher. This policy would benefit both individuals and society as a whole."
