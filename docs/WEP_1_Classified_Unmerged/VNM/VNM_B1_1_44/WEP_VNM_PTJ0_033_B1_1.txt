"Some people argue that it is significant for college students to have a part-time job. From my point of view, I totally agree with this idea with this discussion as now will be discussed.
The first reason is that money from part-time jobs can be beneficial for students’s lives. To clarify, some families do not have a lot of money and they limit the money that they support their children. Students can use their salary from part-time jobs to pay for their bills. This helps to reduce the financial burden on their families. This can be seen in Vietnam, where a lot of students living far from their parents decide to have a part-time job to buy anything they want from their salaries. This makes their life happier and more energetic.
Another point is that they can learn a lot from their workplace. The main reason for this is that they have to meet a lot of people and they have to communicate with them. This allows them to get numerous valuable soft skills such as teamwork, and communication, being more active. Moreover, some part-time jobs can support their future career.
In conclusion, having a part-time job can address many issues in their life.  As such, I strongly agree with the idea that it is significant for college students to have a part-time job."
