"I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country.
First and foremost, secondhand smoke is harmful to others, especially children, the elderly, and people with respiratory issues. Allowing smoking in restaurants exposes non-smokers to dangerous chemicals, even if they choose not to smoke themselves. A ban would protect everyone's right to breathe clean air.
Secondly, smoking in restaurants creates an unpleasant atmosphere. The smell of smoke can ruin the taste of food and make the dining experience uncomfortable for many customers. A smoke-free environment is more welcoming and enjoyable for everyone.
In fact, smoking has become an essential habit for many people in modern life. For some, it helps reduce stress or is simply a part of their daily routine. Therefore, service industries like restaurants should take into account the comfort of their customers as well as their own profit margins. If restaurants can offer a separate smoking area, they can attract both smokers and non-smokers, increasing customer satisfaction and maintaining steady revenue. In my opinion, each restaurant should set up a “smoking area” so that people who want to smoke can pay a fee and smoke there.
Finally, banning smoking in public places such as restaurants may help reduce smoking rates overall. When people are not allowed to smoke freely in public, they may be encouraged to quit or at least reduce the habit, which benefits both individuals and society.
In conclusion, instead of a complete ban on smoking in restaurants, a more balanced approach should be considered. By setting up designated smoking areas, we can protect public health while still respecting the habits of certain customers and supporting the business interests of restaurant owners. This solution offers a win-win outcome for both society and the service industry."
