"I think I disagree with opinion having a part-time job is important.
First, I think we need to know clearly about a part-time job. Part-time job can bring for us too many things good and bad. It can help us make money, but it takes us a lot of time. In college, we spend all of time for discovery about faculty of us, do homework, prepare for lessons, … If we have a part-time job, we could not control our time easily. Experience is one of benefits we can deny. When we work in new office, meet new people, do something new we will feel happy and more interest with that. But we can have more experience in college by join apply to be volunteer for a campaign, organization, … And sometimes, we will forget the reason we go to the college and just notices about a part-time job. So, I think before you want to apply a random job part-time you need to think obviously about learning and working. 
But in my opinion, I don’t recommend you should have a part-time job. In Vietnam, we need to work at least 8 hours for a part-time job and spend time to learn by yourself. For me, it too difficult to manage time.  I disagree with having a part-time job is important."
