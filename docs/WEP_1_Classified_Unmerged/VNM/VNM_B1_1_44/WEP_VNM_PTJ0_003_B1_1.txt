Recently, there are more students who are studying in university choose to earn money form part-time career even though they have their own decision in future job. In my opinion, I totally disagree with this statement for the following two main reasons.
To begin with, having a part-time job during a college student could waste not only your time but also your mental health in university. Being a student, the more lesson to learn the more time to spend. For example, there are more tasks and presentations in class you have to do to improve your skills and your knowledge. According to BBC news, one medical student have to stayed in hospital for one week because her health problems when she did a part-time job in a restaurant.
Secondly, part-time job in university could change their future career. For more evidence, there are many college students who continue to keep working as their part-time job even they are graduated. I think having a job during a college student may change your thought about your faculty in university and your passionate of your own dream job.
In conclusion, there are many effects on your study in university if you have a part-time job in college.
