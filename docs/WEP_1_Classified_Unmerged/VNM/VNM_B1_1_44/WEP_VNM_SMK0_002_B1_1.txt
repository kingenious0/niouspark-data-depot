In my opinion, I completely approve that smoking should be prohibited at all the restaurants in the country. Firstly, smoking brings lots of complications and health damage to other people who do not smoke ( as know as inactive smoking), especially for the pregnant woman and the children. People should do not smoke in public area especially the restaurants with many subjects with variety of ages because they will get annoyed with the smoke. As the smoke can lead to severity symptoms to the one with asthma who they could get dyspnoea and bronchoconstrictions Smoking can affect the pregnant woman well-being, such as: fetal gene disorders and other abnormalities. Smoking is also not allowed if there are children inside as they could get severed respiratory distress. Furthermore, smoking can lead to burning due to the fire from the cigarettes which can damage the building and even even cause the mortality. This should be widely banned in all the restaurants as it also helps to improve quality of life for the smokers as they could stop smoking for a while and prevent the effect on the other well-being. In conclusion, smoking in the restaurants or public area should be banned to protect the well-being from harmful smoke.
