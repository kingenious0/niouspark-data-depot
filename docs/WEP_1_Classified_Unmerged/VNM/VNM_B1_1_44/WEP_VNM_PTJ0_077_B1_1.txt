"For this following statement I agree that because it is really important for student to have a part-time job. If they have a part-time job they can gain valuable of experience, have management skill to manage their finances and learn some important life skill when they do the job.

Firstly, students can develop their work experience by having a job that allows them to meet a lot of different people. With a part-time job, students can build their resumes and improve their chances of getting a good job after. I think a lot of employers prefer to hire employees who already have some experience in life.

Next, spending time to work part-time job helps students earn money to support themselves for life. When studying in college, students may have some difficulty about money, college life can be expensive right? So a part-time job helps them pay for food, for any daily expenses and for school too. I think this is the crucial reason for students should have a part-time job and it also helps them become more independent.

And the last one, when students work they study time management and responsibility is the best skills they need. They can learn how to balance between work and studies and with their personal life. These skills are very useful not only in college but also in their life and more than in their future.
