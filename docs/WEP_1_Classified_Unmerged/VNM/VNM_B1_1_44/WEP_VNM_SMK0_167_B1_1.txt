Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I partly agree with this idea. While smoking should definitely be limited in public places, I think a complete ban in all restaurants may not be necessary if proper regulations are in place. Smoking is harmful not only to smokers but also to people around them. Secondhand smoke can cause serious health problems, especially for children, pregnant women, and people with respiratory conditions. In this sense, banning smoking in indoor areas of restaurants is reasonable and helps protect public health. However, some people are regular smokers and may feel uncomfortable if there is no space for them to smoke. Instead of banning smoking completely, restaurants could provide separate smoking areas, such as outdoor spaces or designated smoking rooms with good ventilation. This way, both smokers and non-smokers can enjoy their meals without disturbing each other. In conclusion, smoking in restaurants should be strictly controlled, especially indoors. But a complete ban in all areas might not be fair to everyone. The better solution is to create clear, separate zones that respect both health and personal freedom.
