I disagree with this view. For me, a student only focuses on studying, I think that part -time job is not really important for students and part -time jobs. There are many reasons to say that part -time job is not really important for students. Firstly, the curriculum is increasingly shortened, I think we should focus on learning to achieve good results, for example, my school has started for students to study for 3.5 years, so one semester we have to study a lot of subjects, the allocation of time for each subject is a difficult problem. Secondly, not only studying at school, we also have to develop other skills such as foreign languages, informatics, ... So in addition to the time of studying in the school, I also need time to have time to learn these skills, if I still go to work, I find that learning will not be effective because we have been tired with many jobs to do. Thirdly, people often go to work to have experience, good at communication, but really necessary while communication skills I have gradually been improved while studying in school, and communicating with people around every day. The last reason is about money, I focus on studying in the school and can get a scholarship if I have high results, like the last period, I have a scholarship of about 14 million VND, so I can earn money and be able to grasp the knowledge, raise the score will definitely be better than going to work to earn more income. For the above reasons, I think the part -time job is not so important to students.
