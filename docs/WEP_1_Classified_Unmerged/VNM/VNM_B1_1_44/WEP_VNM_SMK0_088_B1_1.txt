"In my point of view, I strongly agree that "Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.", especially family restaurants, for some reasons below.

Firstly, the main ingredient of cigarette is nicotine, a very poisonous chemical, so smoking not only causes the problems to other people but also the smokers. It can cause some lung diseases such as cancer. 

Secondly, restaurant is the place that many types of people come a day, including children and older people. What will happen if they have to breath in the atmosphere filled by smoke? I don't want to think about that, but if they have any pulmonic, it will be very bad for their family. 

Finally, in the fact that if a restaurant gets fire, it is because someone smokes and throws the cigarette to the floor. You see? Too dangerous. And I don't think that there is any owner ready to face with that situation and have enough money to solve it. So, banning smoking is a good idea, isn't it?

In conclusion, I just want to say that smoking should be banned at all public places in the country not just at the restaurants cause its disadvantages. When the banned rule is approved, it will be good news for people around the country for sure."
