"Smoking is harmful for your health and smoking in public I don’t think that is good. I agree about banned smoking in the restaurant because I don’t see any good benefit about smoking.
Almost woman and children can’t smell or enjoy when the cigarette burnt. It so uncomfortable when we have a meal in the restaurant with a person smoking. We just want a delicious food, tasty drink without cooks at home. Smoking just brings for one person who smoke fun and bring for somebody else nothing. But sometimes people smoke when they feel stress, we can’t prohibit them to relax or enjoy it. However, now in somewhere we can see area for people smoking in public. We can use it for the restaurant when somebody want to smoke but don’t make annoy for everyone else. It hardly to banned completely smoking so the government had some rule for reduce smoking people. For example, rising tax of cigarette, … If we banned completely smoking, people who smoke can feel so angry or uncomfortable. So, I think we shouldn’t ban completely smoking because it hard and for many reasons else. 
So difficult to banned completely smoking special in the restaurant because they just want to enjoy their life and don’t think too much about annoying. I disagree about smoking should be banned completely at all the restaurant in the country.   "
