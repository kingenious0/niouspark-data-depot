"In my opinion, I totally agree with this statement that the governments of every country should introduce the law to ban smoking at all the restaurants in their countries. 

This is because, restaurants are the public places so it will have a lot of people, including children and people have aged. So, smoking at restaurant can lead to not only bad consequences to children health but also the experiences of every people. For example, just one person smokes in restaurant but the people near them can breathe together with that person. As a result, people and children might be affected to health of lung. 

Secondly, the taste of people who come to restaurant to eat and be affected by the smell of cigarettes because of this reason, banning people who use cigarettes at restaurant is very important for government of each country to protect the public security. And smoking at restaurants might cause the people to come to this restaurant might have a bad experience when trying food at this place. 

So that I think smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country to ensure the experience of visitors, health of everyone and the time of each person when they visit these restaurants with their family."
