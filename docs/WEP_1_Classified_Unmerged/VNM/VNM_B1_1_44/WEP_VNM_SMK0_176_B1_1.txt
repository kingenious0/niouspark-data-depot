"Many people know smoking is bad for health, not only for the person who smoke but also for people near them. Because of that, some people think smoking should not happen in public places. I agree with this because I think it will help many people.
Some people think smoking ban is not good. They say that people can choose if they want go to place with smoke or not. If they don’t like smoke, they don’t need to go there. Also, they say if smoking not allowed, many coffee shops will have less people and maybe close.
But I think ban is better. Smoking is really bad for health. People can get cancer, not only smokers but people who just stand near too. It’s not nice if I don’t smoke but still have to smell it. Shops can still work if they have special area for smokers outside.
To conclude, I think smoking in public is not good and should not be allowed. It will help people don’t get sick, and that is better for everyone."
