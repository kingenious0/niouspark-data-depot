"So far, nearly all restaurants have already prohibited smoking as a positive step to protect the public health. In my opinion, I strongly agree that smoking should be completely disallowed in public places, especially dining areas.
Firstly, smoking in restaurants harms the health of customers and also the staff working their. For instance, it is proved that secondhand smoke can actually lead to serious health issues, such as lung cancer or heart diseases. Non-smoker, including children, pregnant women and the elderly, should not have suffered the smoke.
Secondly, not everyone smokes, so it must be tired for non-smoker to smell the smoke during eating time. For example, the taste would be awfully changed. Banning smoking creates a more human-friendly environment, where people from different ages can comfortably enjoy their meals. Nowadays, many smoke free restaurants attract a significant number of customers, which also brings them profits and reputation. 
In conclusion, smoking in public space should be banned in all restaurants to protect the public health and create a better exprience for customers in restaurants. Allowing smoking in such places not only affects the health of non-smokers but also creates an unpleasant atmosphere for everyone.
