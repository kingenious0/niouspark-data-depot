"For this following statement, I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking in restaurants harms people's health very much, it may create an unpleasant environment for all people.

First, smoking is extremely harmful to all both smokers and non-smokers. Why? Because they can breath this smoke in their body. Smoke contains dangerous chemicals that cause serious health problem such as: cancer, heart disease, and so on. When people smoke in restaurants, others around them are forced to breath in harmful air like I write on. Specially, children and pregnant women are vulnerable to effects of smoking. I think restaurant should be a place where people can eat their meal delicious.

Secondly, the smell of smoke is very uncomfortable. The smell can ruin the taste of food and create a bad experience for customers. A lot of people hate the smell of cigarettes like me and if the restaurants have smoking, it does not have me and most of people at here. So restaurants should ban smoking it can make more enjoyable for everyone.

Finally, everyone has the right to breathe clean air so banning smoking in restaurants protects the rights of non-smokers. I am sure that non-smokers dislike negatively affect from smokers, it effects their choice of restaurants. So restaurants should prioritize the health and comfort of all customers. If people want to smoke, they can find the private spaces where it is not banned.

To sum up, in all restaurants, smoking should be completely banned. It can protect people's health and also improve the dining experience to help them have a good time. It's also the respect attitude for the rights of non-smokers. "
