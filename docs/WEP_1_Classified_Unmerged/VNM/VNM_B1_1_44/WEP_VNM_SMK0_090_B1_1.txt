"Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in my country because it affects people's health, creates an unpleasant environment, and can harm a business.

First, smoking in restaurants affects the smokers and the non-smokers, especially the children and the mothers who are getting pregnant. Smoking seriously causes many diseases to the smokers and the people around them, such as lung cancer, heart disease, throat and mouth cancer, etc. So, quitting smoking can significantly improve health and reduce the risk of disease. Especially, when you are in a restaurant and get ready to taste the meal, the smell of cigarettes can ruin the taste of food and make the atmosphere uncomfortable. Many people prefer clean and fresh air while eating. 

Secondly, smoking can drive customers away. For example, many people choose non-smoking restaurants over those allowed smoking because they always set their health for the best. In addition, banning smoking in restaurants can lead to a healthier life, and help the customers enjoy their whole meal. Besides, it reduces cigarette consumption and helps smokers avoid diseases. 
 
Overall, smoking should not be allowed at all the restaurants in my country. A smoke-free environment protects people's health, makes dining more enjoyable, and benefits business owners. Therefore, banning smoking in restaurants is a good decision. "
