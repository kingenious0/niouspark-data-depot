"I don’t think it is very important for college students to have a part-time job. Of course, earning money is helpful, but studying should be the main goal during college years.

When students work part-time, they often feel tired. Sometimes, they don’t have enough time or energy to focus on school. I think it’s better to use that time to study more, do assignments, or review lessons. Grades are important, and a part-time job can make it harder to do well in class. Also, many part-time jobs are not useful for the future. For example, if I want to be a teacher or office worker, working in a coffee shop or delivering food may not help much. It’s better to spend time on things like internships or school projects that are related to our major. 

I know some students have to work because of money problems. In that case, part-time jobs are okay. But if students can live without working, I think they should focus on learning and growing.

In short, I believe that studying comes first. A part-time job can be good for some, but it is not the most important thing for college students."
