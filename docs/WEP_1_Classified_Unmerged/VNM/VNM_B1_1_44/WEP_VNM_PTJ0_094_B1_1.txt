"Nowadays, college students have a part-time job is more popular. I think having a part-time job is important. But it has advantage and disadvantage with college students. 

Firstly, having a part-time job has a lot of advantage because it helps college students pay fees at college more easily that it also helps their parents feel less nervous about fees. College students can have more experience such as social skill, sort skill, and so on. On top of things, some college students have free time after college so they can get part-time job instead of they are lazy at home. But having part-time job will be good with college students if they can balance between studying at college and job.  

Secondly, if college students just focus having part-time job, they may have a big problem. It is also disadvantaging. For example, they miss a lot of lessons from teacher because they don't go to college and then they can't do exam well.  On top of things, having part-time job is bad if college students meet bad things such as bad master, bad work and so on. They waste time a lot.  

In conclusion, having part-time is important if college students can balance between at college and job. It is important with many poor students but they really want to study at college. "
