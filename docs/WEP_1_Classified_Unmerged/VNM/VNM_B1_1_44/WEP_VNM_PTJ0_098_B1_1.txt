"Recently, many university students are joining the workplace, eventually this wave of trend is increasing day by day. In my opinion, attending the workplace early, or having a part-time job, is not true or false, it depends on many factors such as their background of family, their interests and their freetime also. 

First of all, I will talk about the benefits of attending the workplace early. Attending the workplace supports the financial demand of students such as personal fees or the rent. Moreover, that also helps people accommodate with a new environment and accumulate the workplace experience that make them more confident and trust themself.

Although with many benefits, having a part-time job also causes negative effects. Students not only have a huge deadline in their school, but also have to participate in extracurricular activities like club, hang out with their friends. Having lost control of the balance between study life and real life, they not only don't have free time to reflect themself, but also have risks to burn out.

In conclusion, having a part-time job while studying in university has many benefits but still has a negative effect. In the competing society right now, we deeply need to study how to control our time to make our life more efficient.
