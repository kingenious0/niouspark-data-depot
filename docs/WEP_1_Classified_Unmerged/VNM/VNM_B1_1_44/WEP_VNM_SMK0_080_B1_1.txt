"Nowadays, there are many services appear to meet people's demand. And one of famous services that everyone prefers to choose is restaurants. But in some restaurants, many people still smoke, and it affects a lot of people around them. So in my point of view, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because of these following reasons:

Firstly, all of you know that cigarette is very harmful to people's health. It has a lot of poison and leads to many things about health and affects our body like lung, stomach, therefore when we smoke in public especially in the restaurants, many people will be effects like children and the elderly. 

Moreover, it will make people around you uncomfortable because it smells very disgusting and it make them cannot eat their dishes. You can imagine that if there are a lot of people smoke in your restaurants, I think in the future no one want to go to this restaurants again. Cigarette not only affects your health but also affects your feeling about the food. Therefore I think we have to ban smoking at all the restaurant to improve our health and feeling.

In conclusion, this is an efficient solution to improve our health, it also prevents us from many diseases. Therefore, smoking should be completely banned not only at restaurants but also at public places in our country."
