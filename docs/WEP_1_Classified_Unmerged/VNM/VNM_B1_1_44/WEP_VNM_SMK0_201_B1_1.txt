"Smoking in public is a big problem we are facing these days, especially people face more competition and pressure so many of them smoke to reduce stress. Some people think it is normal but I strongly believe smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants.
Firstly, smoking affect health, money, and the people around . In fact, cigarettes are very harmful because they contain toxic chemicals so that they smoke in places like restaurants where people sit nearby can breath in these smoke, which cause a serious condition for health. Banning smoking in restaurants help create a cleaner and more comfortable space for everyone. Especially, families with children, pregnant women and old people can enjoy their meals without feeling annoyed or worried since the air is fresher.
Secondly, banning smoking in restaurants can improve the image of the country. Tourists and visitors will feel that the country is clean, modern and care about their public health. It also build a polite and respectful culture where people think about others not only themselves. This can make them want to come back again or recommend the place to others. 
In conclusion, smoking should not be allowed in any restaurants. It is bad for health and makes others uncomfortable. Moreover, it enhaces the country image and shows that we care about building a modern and respectful society.
