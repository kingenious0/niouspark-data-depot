"Working part-time is important for students but sometimes has some disadvantages so I also agree and disagree with the statement"" It's important for college students to have a part-time job.""

 First of all, I will talk about the advantages of the part-time job. The part-time job is an opportunity for students to have little allowances to earn a living and help their parents with a little money. With disadvantaged students, a part-time job will help them very much. As you know, when you go to university, your parents have to prepare a large sum of money for you to pay fees, rent the accommodation, eat and drink, etc. 

Besides, when you get a part-time job, you will learn many new things from the people around you, they will teach you and show your weakness, sometimes they will hurt you. Certainly, you feel sad and disappointed but it helps your future, you not only learn more skills but also give you more opportunities. There are some facts that the college students will become clever and hard-working and specially they will be a planner to arrange everything well. Therefore it's quite important for the college to have a part-time job. It will open a lot of interesting things to you. 

About the disadvantage of it, we are also students, our main mission is learning. So learning is fundamental to give you a brighter future. Accept that when you know the way to arrange the schedule to control. But it's hard to balance between learning and working. I remember my teacher said: "If you get the part-time job, and the job proper with your major, just do it". 

In conclusion, I think working a part-time job will gain experiences and skills but sometimes it has some disadvantages, so you should be considerate."
