"Even though we all know about the terrible effects of smoking, some people still use that method as their daily stress reliever. It cannot be denied that nowadays most men, some have family smoke every day, it is hard to give up on it. 
It is said that smoking should be totally prohibited at all restaurants in the country. I find it right because in restaurants we only eat and talk to each other and that is also a precious moment for everyone gathering to enjoy their meal. So, what if you smell the smoke while having delicious food? It will be annoying. Banning tobacco in restaurants is a good thing to do to limit the discomfort, the smell that affects the feeling of food and most of all, the toxicity it brings to people around. The ban on smoking will cause inconvenience and discomfort to those who are using drugs, but for a clean and healthy society as well as improving air quality, we should have another solution for them. A ban is still a ban for me.
In brief, a complete restriction on scorching in a city can bring many benefits to public health and the living environment. However, to effectively implement this policy, consensus, and cooperation from the public along with appropriate support and propaganda measures are needed.
