I strongly agree that smoking should be  completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are a lot of reason for my opinion. First, restaurant is a public place for everyone, so this is not a good place for smoking. I think smoking should be done in private. Second, a lot of people can breathe and inhale these smoking. With my knowdelge, the person who actively smoke doesnâ€™t affect their health than the person unactively being smoked. If someone smokes in a  restaurant, every customer there has to be affected by this moke without control. Children, the old and who is allergic to smoke easily become victims for this. Third, smoking in a public place like restaurant is an impolite action. A person with a cigarette in the mouth will destroy all the delicious and yummy dishes, the smells, anything. Last but not least, ban is a great way to warn and prevent people doing it. If we just limit and warn about smoking in the restaurent, they easily make a blind and continute smoking. I think we should have a strong ban like a lot of money or anything stronger to make sure all the people will do it. In summary, smoking should completely banned at all the restaurants in the country is a great idea for me.
