     I agree with this opinion because nowadays cancer is more popular in young people. Restaurant should also completely banned electric smoking. In some studies, people who absorb the smoke will get cancer more easily than the smoker. At the restaurant usually have children, old man, their resistance very weak. Beside that, the smoke also super uncomfortable. In the restaurant they should make a sign write on it “Do not smoking” and the government really courage that. Some restaurant that have a place for smoking and it really helpful. But some people they saw the sign but still ignore it so the restaurant must punish them. When some throw the cigarette with the fire still on it is very dangerous. But people will realize that they must not smoking when they come in the restaurant where has air condiner is turning on. In summary, smoking affect your health, make you feel depend on it and also wasting money. So all restaurant should banned smoking because it will affect the food they serve, affect the customers who uncomfortable with the smoke, they should have a place for only smoking. Smoking is not bad but smoking in the wrong area is very bad.
