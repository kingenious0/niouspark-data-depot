"I totally agree with the statement "Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants int the country." 

In my opinion, smoking is an activity that harm our health seriously. And in a public place like restaurant, that activity can not accept because the smoke from smoking can harm for everybody in the restaurant. The smoke makes people unpleasant and do not want to continue eating. Restaurants are not the open space so the smoke may be in here. 
When many people smoke, smoke can increase through the time and make all things in the restaurant have terrible smell. After a period of time, customers will not come to this restaurant once more time. That can decrease the income of the restaurant and can close forever. If many restaurants close, the economy of the country can be affected. 

In addition, smoking in the public place, especially the restaurants, can make foreigners who travel to the country have bad impression about the how the local people act in the public place and they do not want to back this country again. This activity can affect the tourism of the country
 
In short, smoking is not a good activity for the health of community and the economy of the country."
