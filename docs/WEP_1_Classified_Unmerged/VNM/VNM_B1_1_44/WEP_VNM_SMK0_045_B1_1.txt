"In my perspective, smoking should be completely prohibited at all the restaurants in the country. This essay will point out the drawbacks of smoking at the restaurant.
Restaurant is not a suitable place to smoke because it is a public area which means many people may suffer its consequences, especially pregnant woman and children who are vulnerable. Some people may suffer the odor of smoking but there are people who cannot suffer that. The person who smokes is received bad results but the one who inhale that smoke is received more dangerous health problems. Smoking can cause several health problems such as lung cancer, mouth and teeth problems. As a result, it can affect the overall health problems. As a result, it can reduce quality of life. If it is hard to completely prohibited smoking, I think building a room for smoking only is significant, especially in public area. People smoke because it may seem to be a way to stress relief, but it is not the only way. There are numerous ways to recharge such as playing sports, painting, listening which are not only help them stress relief but also gain mental and physical health. 
In conclusion, smoking should be completely prohibited at all the restaurants in the country because of its drawbacks such as causing health problems and affecting everyone around."
