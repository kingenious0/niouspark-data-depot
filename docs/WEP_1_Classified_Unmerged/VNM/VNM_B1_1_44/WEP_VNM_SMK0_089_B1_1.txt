"Smoking is very common in our earth or country, from home, street to restaurant and many other public places. Smoking causes serious effects on health, so it should be banned everywhere. Therefore, I totally agree with the point that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.

First, the reason why I agree is that it is worrying for a passive smoker. It is not only uncomfortable due to the smell but also dangerous because of  the disease it will bring. Some diseases include lung cancer, asthma, and many others serious health problems. Not only passive smokers but only active smokers themselves will suffer from these diseases. For example, when I came to a restaurant in district 1, a man was smoking a cigarette during my meal, which made me angry and I could not breathe easily. This shows that smoking in restaurants negatively affects non smokers, making dining experiences unpleasant and unhealthy.

The second reason why I think smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country is it impacts cleanliness and safety. Smoking will linger on furniture and curtains, make customers feel uncomfortable or worried about quality and service, so it affects customer experience and the restaurant. For example, I once visited a small restaurant where the cigarette smell was so strong that I lost my appetite. Some customers even left without ordering. This harms the restaurant's business.So allowing smoking can drive customers away, leading to financial loss for the restaurant.

To conclude, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. For more, smokers should be aware about the negative effect they bring to themselves and other people.
