"Nowadays, some restaurants have people who smoke in public, smoking is a profound problem in our lives because it affects people's health and causes air pollution in life. So, someone said that it should be completely banned  at all restaurants in the country. I agree with this opinion.

Firstly, smoking is dangerous for both smokers and non-smokers. It negatively impacts their health like difficulty breathing or serious diseases like cancer, especially, elderly people, pregnant women and children. So when someone smokes in the restaurant, they put other's health at risk. 

Secondly, the smell of cigarettes causes the bad air environment in the restaurant, it makes food less enjoyable and people can not eat in that atmosphere. Moreover, smokers can throw their cigarettes in the restaurant which makes the restaurant dirty. It causes a pollution environment so the customers will never return to that restaurant. 

In conclusion, smoking causes many negative effects on our lives from harming people's health and an unpleasant atmosphere. In the future, people should ban smokers at all restaurants in the country to protect people's health and comfort environment. A smoke free place not only improves customers satisfaction but also enhances the overall quality of the restaurant.
