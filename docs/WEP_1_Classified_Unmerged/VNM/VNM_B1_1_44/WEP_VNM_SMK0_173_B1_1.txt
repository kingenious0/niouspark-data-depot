I do not agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. One reason is that it can reduce the restaurant’s revenue. Many customers who smoke may not want to return if they can not smoke at all. This can make the restaurant lose money, especially small restaurants or coffee shops where people often enjoy smoking while talking. If many customers stop coming, the restaurant might have to cut staff or even closing. This will affect not only the businesses but also workers. Another reason is that there can be a better solution. Restaurants should make two separate areas — one for smokers and one for non-smokers. In this way, both groups of customers can feel comfortable. Smokers can still enjoy their time, and non-smokers will not be bothered by smoke. This idea is more fair and can help avoid problems. In conclusion, banning smoking completely is not the best way. It can cause restaurants to lose money and make smokers feel angry. A better way is to divide smoking and non-smoking zones so that everyone can enjoy their meal.
