"Owing to the advancement in living standard, the daily expenses of the populations have significantly increased regarding the medical, educational section,…Hence, to relieve the parents’ financial burden, several tertiary learners spend their time engaging in part-time jobs. While there are numerous advocates support that notion, some critics oppose that it would detrimentally affect the students. From my perspective, I strongly agree with the former idea, and the following essay will state some reasons to support my viewpoint.
Regarding the financial aspects, doing part-time jobs not only positively affect the parents but also themselves. In fact, some students can not afford to their tuition fee and eventually drop out of school due to the escalating costs. In some cases, parents simultaneously do several occupations to earn more money, expecting their children will have a better access to a qualified education. Therefore, students may have much more income by working part time as to pay for the pricey tuition fee and also purchasing their interested things by themselves.
In contrast, some people criticize that part-time jobs engagement lead to the poor academic performance of students, possibly hampering students from concentrating on their studies and encountering severe health problems under long-working hours. Although it may sound true to some certain extent, I still concur that it offers various advantages for college students. Another merit of partaking in part-time job is that students can enhance their soft skills such as problem-solving, time management skill, … which can not be taught in class. Those skills play a crucial role which help students to be well-prepared prior to embarking in their careers. 
In conclusion, doing part time jobs provide several advantages for college students due to various reasons. However, students should make a timetable to strike a work-study balance and mitigate the potential demerits."
