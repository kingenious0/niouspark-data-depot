Smoking is considered one of the most dangerous factors that cause millions of deaths in the world annually. There is a lot of research that finds smoking extremely harmful to humanâ€™s health. Hence, I agree that all the restaurants should have a regulation that bans smoking completely. In this essay, I will prove my point of view clearly.

Restaurants are places where people spend time together. The space of each table is quite small, and these areas are close, too. So, if someone smokes, people around can easily smell that. It significantly affects individuals who are enjoying their meals, especially in a small restaurant. This can make other customers feel frustrated and uncomfortable.

When it comes to health, we cannot deny the negative effects smoking brings. It causes diseases related to lungs. It not only harms to person who uses it directly but also affects the one who smells the smoke accidentally. As a result, there are a lot of people who pass away due to smoking directly and indirectly.

In conclusion, because of the huge profit of cigarettes for the economy, it is hard to stop businesses. However, we can declare rules or regulations for banning smoking in public, particularly in restaurants.
