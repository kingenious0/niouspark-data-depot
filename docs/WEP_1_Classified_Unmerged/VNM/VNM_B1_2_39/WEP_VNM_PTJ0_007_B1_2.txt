"It is undeniable that having a job during leisure times would be a great experience for students in college. However, I would argue that there are some drawbacks of having a part-time job during college time.
On the one hand, having a job can bring about many benefits for college students. First, it is totally a great opportunity for those who want to gain some new skills. For example, by working as a waiter in a restaurant, one can not only learn how to do things in a careful way, but can also have a chance to communicate with people from all walks of life, which definitely enhances their communication skills. In addition, the act of having a part-time job can be beneficial in terms of problem-solving skills, making one more skillful in solving real life situations. Lastly, having a job is absolutely a good way to make more income, especially for those who have some economic difficulties. 
On the other hand, given many benefits listed above, having a job in accompany with school works is not the best idea. In fact, by doing two works at a time could make one’s life imbalanced. This is because it is somewhat lacking of time for ones to focusing on their homework after hours of hardworking, in addition to their large study schedules. Additionally, it is sometime hard for ones who have just entered the college to adapt with the real life environments, as they have been nourished and helped by their parents for a very long period of time. 
In conclusion, I think that although having a part-time job can be beneficial for college students, but it can give rise to some significant drawbacks. The final decision to whether work or not would solely depend on their preferences and main problems.
