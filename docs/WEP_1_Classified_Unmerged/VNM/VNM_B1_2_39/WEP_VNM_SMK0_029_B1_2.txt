"At the present, smoking is becoming a main problem happening all around the world. The majority of the store sell the tobacco. Whether smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants is a topic that generates significant debate. Here’s some opinion of the arguments on both sides:
On the first hand, exposure to secondhand smoke can cause serious health issues, including respiratory problems, heart disease, and cancer. Banning smoking in restaurants protects non-smokers, including children, pregnant women, and employees, from these risks.
On the second hand, restaurant staff are particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of secondhand smoke due to their prolonged exposure in the workplace. 
However, it consisted many personal freedom. Adults should have the right to choose whether to smoke or not. Some argue that as long as there are designated smoking areas that do not affect non-smokers, smoking should be allowed.
In conclusion, I personally agree that smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants. While it is important to consider personal freedom and business rights, these can be addressed through designated smoking areas outside of restaurants, ensuring that the indoor dining experience remains safe and enjoyable for everyone. The health and welfare of the general public should take consideration in order to protect the space green, properly and beautiful. "
