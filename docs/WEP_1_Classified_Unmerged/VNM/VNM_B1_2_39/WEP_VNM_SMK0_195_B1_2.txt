"nowadays, smoking is becoming more and more popular in word day,including in Vietnam.it is widely debated whether smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.Personally ,I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Smoking in public places like restaurants not only affects the health of smokers, but it also harms non-smokers through secondhand smoke. This essay will provide some reasons and relevant example to support my arguments
Fist and foremost, it should be recognized  secondhand smoke is dangerous. Many scientific studies have shown that even brief exposure can cause serious health problems, such as asthma, heart disease, and cancer. When people smoke in restaurants, everyone around them—including children, the elderly, and staff—are forced to inhale toxic chemicals.This clearly demonstrates that smoking has a negative impact on healthy. A ban would protect public health and save lives.Banning smoking would improve the overall dining experience. Most customers do not enjoy the smell of smoke while eating. Smoke can ruin the taste of food and make the atmosphere unpleasant. A smoke-free environment is more welcoming, especially for families and people with health conditions.
Furthermore,  restaurant workers deserve a safe workplace. They spend long hours inside and cannot avoid the harmful effects of smoke if it is allowed. Banning smoking protects their rights and promotes fairness.
In conclusion, I believe smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. It protects health, improves the environment, and ensures that everyone can enjoy their meals without discomfort. Such a ban would benefit both customers and workers, and it is a necessary step toward a healthier society.
