"Smoking in restaurants is a pressing topic that has sparked much debate across the world. Some people are strongly against it, while others advocate for individual freedom and designated-smoking areas. In my opinion, both sides possess valid arguments.
On one hand, strong criticism of smoking at public places like restaurants originates from health risks, even with passive smoking. Scientific studies have justified the fact that exposure to smoking can lead to excruciating illness, namely lung diseases, respiratory problems and even cancer. Furthermore, some restaurants are constructed with close space, resulting in limited air circulation and making others susceptible to harmful smoke. Additionally, the implementation of a smoking ban in the public promotes a healthier lifestyle within the community. Being restricted with tobacco consumption will foster incentives of giving up smoking.
However, some argue that a blanket ban infringes on the rights of smokers. They might assert that adults should have the freedom to make personal choices, including smoking, as long as they do not directly harm others. Business owners instead should designate smoking areas to cater for the needs of smokers. Besides, another concern is that banning smoking may negatively affect restaurant businesses, especially a loss of customers and revenue. If smoking is entirely prohibited in these restaurants, smokers will choose other frequent establishments where smoking is still permitted.
In conclusion, while the implementation of prohibiting smoking at all the restaurants plays a vital role in safeguarding public health, a blanket ban seems not to be justified for some people. Thus, the separation of smoke and free-smoke environments is imperative to minimize damages.
