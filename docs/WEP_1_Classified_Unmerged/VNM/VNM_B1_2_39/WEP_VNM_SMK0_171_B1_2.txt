"I agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country. Smoking is bad for peopleâ€™s health, and it also makes the environment uncomfortable for others.
First, smoking is harmful not only to the smoker but also to people around them. In restaurants, many people sit close to each other. If someone smokes, the smoke can go to other tables. This is called secondhand smoke, and it can make people sick. Children, old people, and people with health problems can feel very bad if they breathe in the smoke.
Second, the smell of cigarettes can make the food taste worse. Many people go to restaurants to enjoy food and relax. If someone is smoking nearby, it is hard to enjoy the meal. Some people may even choose not to come back to the restaurant again. If all restaurants ban smoking, customers will feel more comfortable.
Also, a smoke-free restaurant looks cleaner and more modern. It gives a good image to customers. Workers in the restaurant also do not have to work in a place full of smoke, which is better for their health and safety.
In conclusion, smoking in restaurants should not be allowed. It is bad for health, makes the environment worse, and can cause problems for both customers and workers. A full ban will help everyone enjoy their meals in a clean and safe place."
