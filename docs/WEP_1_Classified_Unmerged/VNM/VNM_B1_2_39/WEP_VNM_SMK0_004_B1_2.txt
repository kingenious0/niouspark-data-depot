I will express my opinion on whether smoking should be banned in restaurants in different countries.I completely agree with the above viewpoint .Banning smoking in restaurants is a crucial measure to protect public health and create a healthy dining environment. When people smoke, cigarette smoke containing harmful substances like nicotine, carbon monoxide, and other carcinogenic chemicals spreads in the air, harming both smokers and those around them. Non-smokers who inhale secondhand smoke are at higher risk of respiratory diseases, cardiovascular issues, and cancer. Children and the elderly are particularly vulnerable to the effects of cigarette smoke. Prohibiting smoking in restaurants not only protects the health of customers but also the employees working there.A smoke-free environment will be cleaner and more comfortable, allowing diners to enjoy their meals without worrying about cigarette smoke. By creating smoke-free environments, countries can significantly reduce healthcare costs associated with smoking-related illnesses and improve overall air quality . Additionally, this policy encourages people to quit smoking, thereby reducing the smoking rate in the community. Banning smoking in restaurants is a necessary policy that should be enforced worldwide to protect human health and improve the quality of life.Smoking is very harmful to your health, so quit smoking to avoid affecting the good health of yourself and your family.Appreciate your health before cigarette smoke affects you.
