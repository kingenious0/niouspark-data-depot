I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Smoking in public places, especially where food is served, causes health problems and discomfort for many people. First, smoking affects everyone, not just the smoker. Second-hand smoke is dangerous and can cause serious health issues such as lung cancer, asthma, and heart disease. When people smoke in restaurants, other customers — including children and the elderly — are forced to breathe harmful chemicals. This is unfair and unsafe. Second, smoking ruins the dining experience. Most people go to restaurants to enjoy good food and spend quality time with friends or family. The smell of smoke can ruin the taste of food and make the environment unpleasant. In a smoke-free restaurant, the air is cleaner, and the atmosphere is more welcoming for all customers. Moreover, banning smoking protects restaurant staff. Waiters, chefs, and other workers spend many hours in the restaurant. If people are allowed to smoke inside, workers are exposed to smoke for a long time, which puts their health at risk. A smoke-free environment ensures a safer and healthier workplace. Some people argue that smokers have the right to smoke. However, that right should not harm others. They can smoke in private places without affecting public health. In conclusion, smoking should be banned in all restaurants to protect public health, improve the dining experience, and create a healthier environment for both customers and workers.
