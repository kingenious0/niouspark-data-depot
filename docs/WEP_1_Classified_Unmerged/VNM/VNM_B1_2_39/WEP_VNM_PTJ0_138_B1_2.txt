"Some people believe that having a part-time job during college is essential for students. However, I disagree with this opinion. In my view, studying should be the top priority for college students, especially in demanding fields like accounting and auditing.
As a senior student majoring in accounting and auditing, I understand how challenging and knowledge-intensive this field is. To truly grasp the lessons taught in class, students must dedicate sufficient time and effort to their studies. In my opinion, a part-time job can distract students from fully focusing on academic goals. For example, important subjects such as financial reporting, auditing standards, and taxation require not only classroom learning but also additional self-study and practice.
Moreover, students in this field often aim to achieve international certifications such as CPA or ACCA. These certifications are highly respected and valuable for future careers, but they require a deep understanding of technical content and significant preparation time. Although I have always wanted to pursue these certifications, I must admit that I have not yet been able to do so, even as a fourth-year student. One of the reasons is that balancing too many commitments would make it harder for me to perform well academically.
In conclusion, while part-time jobs may provide some benefits, I believe that for students in specialized fields like accounting and auditing, focusing on academic excellence and professional certifications is more important. This foundation will offer greater long-term value than temporary work experience."
