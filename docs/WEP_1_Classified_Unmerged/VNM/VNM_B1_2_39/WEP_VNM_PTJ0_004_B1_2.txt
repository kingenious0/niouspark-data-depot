I will express my thoughts on whether part-time work is really important for students or not. Of course I completely agree with this opinion. Because working part-time after school can help you earn enough money for daily living, catering or entertainment needs, in addition, this can also help you. Some students with difficult family circumstances can help their families with part of their tuition fees. Working overtime can also help you accumulate more valuable knowledge in society, while also developing soft skills such as communication, time management, and teamwork. Helps students build a network of relationships and expand future career opportunities.However, working part-time also has certain challenges. .It is important for students to choose jobs that suit their study schedule and health, as well as develop effective time management skills. This way, they can take advantage of the benefits of part-time work without compromising their main study goals. If students do not know how to balance work and study, they are susceptible to stress, fatigue, and academic performance. Finally, being independent while working part-time also trains a sense of responsibility and confidence, better preparing for life after graduation. So I think that part-time work will be very important for students, it will help you a lot, and choose a job that suits you and know how to stay healthy to be able to work. work and study well.
