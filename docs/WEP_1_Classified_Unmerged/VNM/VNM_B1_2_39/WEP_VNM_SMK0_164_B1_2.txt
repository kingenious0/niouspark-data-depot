"From my perspective, smoking in public places, especially restaurants and food stores in my country should be prohibited. 
Firstly, smoking causes a number of diseases. This is because cigarettes contain a lot of toxic emissions. When someone is smoking, not only them but also the people around them could easily absorb that in the air and especially in a place that doesn't have open space like a restaurant. As a result, people in there at that time may affect when they breathe, which could bring the risk to their immune system. Moreover, the smell of cigarettes is heavy, which could make people at the food store feel frustrated, thereby bringing an annoying experience for them. As a result, the restaurant allowing smoking inside could lose their customers, and decrease the profit.
On the other hand, some people would agree that we should allow smoking inside the restaurant. This is related to human rights, that people have the right to do what they want legally, and smoking is not illegal. Moreover, a lot of open restaurants currently have a smoking area, which is convenient for those who can not bear not smoking for a couple of hours.
In conclusion, I still believe that banning smoking at all restaurants is the right way to enable people to maintain good health and not bother others.
