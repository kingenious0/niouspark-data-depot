"Some people express their opinion that smoking is harmful, and it is important that smoking be banned at all restaurants in the country. I would argue that smoking should be banned, but such changes would be too radical.
Smoking is harmful not only to the smoker but also for the people around them.  For example, smoking in public releases smoke that affects the health of the smokers and causes other people who inhale the smoke to be sick. Other people who are of no business would be affected by the smoke. In many developed countries (e.g. Japan, the US), dining places either ban smoking altogether or establish separate spaces for smokers, as many people argue that it is unfair that non-smokers are indirectly harmed by the acts of smokers. It is imperative that smoking be banned in restaurants around the country. But, at the same time, those changes should take place in a step-by-step manner. The first thing that we should do is to actively campaign against smoking and raise awareness. Secondly, governments should introduce legislation that requires smoking to be banned in public places and set up smoking areas in public places. When public awareness of smoking is of an appropriate level, only then can governments ban smoking in public places, restaurants altogether. By employing a constructive approach to banning smoking, governments can ensure that the banning is well received and successfully implemented.
In conclusion, I am of the argument that smoking be banned in eateries and restaurants, for its detrimental effect to the smokers and the public, but the banning per se should be implemented constructively. While smokers are allowed to smoke, it is unfair that the act of smoking affects non-smokers. Thus, it is important to ban smoking constructively to protect the public from smoking."
