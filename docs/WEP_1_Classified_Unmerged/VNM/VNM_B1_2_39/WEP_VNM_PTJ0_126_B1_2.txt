"There are many people who believe that the undergraduate should spend their time working a part-time job. I strongly agree with this point of view because a lot of part- time work only requires minimum skill sets, experience, and a flexible schedule which is suitable for college students.

First of all, it is generally agreed that students can get more practical experience for both their future careers. In fact, formal training under college or university institutions only provides students with a basic background of knowledge. Therefore, working part-time seems to be more advantageous as it helps students to learn more about responsibilities as well as business hurdles they might encounter, which reinforces what they are learning in school. For example, some studies proved that students working part-time jobs have more confidence than the others when they get into the work field after graduation. 

Furthermore, with part-time work, students can earn more money to spend on their daily expenses. College students often spend 4-5 years to finish their studies, which costs a lot of money and puts a burden on their family's financial resources. As a result, it is important for students to work a part time job to reduce their debt.  In fact, there has been an increase in the number of students leaving college or university because they donâ€™t have enough money to pay for training fees in recent years. In addition, it is evident that it is hard to earn money in most situations, so earning money during school years also teaches students to understand the true values of money.

In Conclusion, it is clearly evident that students can gain several benefits from working part-time. Apart from getting more practical experiences and earning money to spend on their tuition as well as daily expenses, they can properly develop their time management skills, which, hopefully, prepare them for a good future.
