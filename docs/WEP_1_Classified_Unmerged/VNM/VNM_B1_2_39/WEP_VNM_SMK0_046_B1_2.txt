"It is proposed that smoking should be prohibited from all the restaurants nationally. Personally, I am an advocate of this proposal for a number of reasons.

First of all, it is no doubt that the smoke of any kind of cigarettes is harmful to human. At the restaurants, there are many people of various ages including toddlers and young children. If smoking was allowed, it would be extremely harmful for the kids’ health. Not only that, many people including adults are allergic to the smoke of cigarettes. This can make them feel ill and sometimes even vomit inside the restaurants.

Second, the smoke of cigarettes can interfere the taste of the dishes in the restaurants. People go to the restaurants in order to enjoy the taste of delicious and nutritious dishes. If there is someone starting to smoke, the smoke can affect the taste of other guests’ dishes and even the atmosphere of the restaurants. 

Finally, smoking in a restaurant could sometimes cause fire. This is a rare situation; however, it still can happen. Therefore, it would cause a lot of damage for humans and possessions.

In conclusion, considering the all the above mentioned reasons, I believe that smoking of any kind should be completed prohibited at all the restaurants in the country. "
