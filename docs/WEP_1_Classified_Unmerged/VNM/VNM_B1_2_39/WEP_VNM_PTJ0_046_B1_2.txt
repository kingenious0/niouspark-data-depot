"Many people believe that it is essential for university students to have a part-time job. Personally, I agree with this sentiment for a number of reasons.

First of all, going to college is not just about studying and gaining knowledge; it is also about developing skills. When a student have a part-time job, they can develop many soft skills as well as hard skills such as time management skills, teamwork skills, communication skills and computer skills. These skills are all very crucial for their future career. Therefore, if a student have a part-time job while going to college, they have the opportunity to develop many valuable skills, which are beneficial for both their study and future work.

Second, college students can earn some money to help with their tuition fees and living expenses. When a student goes to college, their parents have to pay for them many kinds of fees. It can be a burden to them. If a student have a part-time job, they can earn some money to pay their own fees although the salary may not be too high.

Finally, students should be encouraged to have a part-time job because it helps them to be more active and responsible. When a student have a part-time job, they will find a way to balance their study and their work. They have to ensure that their work will not interfere their study, which makes them more responsible. Having a part-time job also helps college students more active because they have to work and study at the same time.

In conclusion, I believe that university students should have a part-time job because it will bring about a great number of benefits for them."
