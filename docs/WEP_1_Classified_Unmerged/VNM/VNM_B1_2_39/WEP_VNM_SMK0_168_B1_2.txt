"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are many reasons why this ban is necessary.
Firstly, smoking is harmful not only to smokers but also to people around them. Many people go to restaurants to enjoy food and relax after a hard working day. If someone smokes, it can make others uncomfortable, annoyed or even sick. Beside that, smoke can lead to health problems especially for children, the elderly, and people with breathing issues.
Secondly, the smell of smoke can have a bad effect on  the dining experience. Most people do not want to eat in a place that smells like cigarettes. Smoke can also stay on clothes and furniture, making the restaurant less clean and making the environment more uncomfortable. 
Thirdly, banning smoking in restaurants can help encourage smokers to quit, it will reduce the amount of smokers and cigarettes because if people cannot smoke in public places, they may smoke less or stop completely. This will improve public health in the long term.
In conclusion, I do believe that smoking should be banned in all restaurants and public places. This rule will protect peopleâ€™s health, improve the environment, and create a cleaner and safer place for everyone.
