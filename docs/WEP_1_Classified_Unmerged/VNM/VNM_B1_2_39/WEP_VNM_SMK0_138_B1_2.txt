"I strongly agree that smoking, including both traditional and electronic cigarettes, should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Smoking is not only harmful to the smokers themselves but also poses serious health risks to the people around them.
Second-hand smoke is extremely dangerous. Even when someone does not smoke, they can still suffer from the harmful effects of breathing in smoke in public spaces like restaurants. This is especially concerning for children, pregnant women, and people with respiratory conditions. I believe that restaurants should be places where everyone feels safe and comfortable—not places where people are forced to breathe in toxic air while trying to enjoy a meal.
I once witnessed a heartbreaking situation near my house. A man smoked constantly at home, even when his wife was pregnant. After she gave birth, the baby was diagnosed with health problems caused by constant exposure to cigarette smoke during pregnancy. Hearing about this made me deeply upset and more aware of how harmful smoking can be—not only to the smoker but to innocent people around them.
In conclusion, allowing smoking in restaurants threatens public health. To protect everyone—especially the most vulnerable—smoking should be fully banned in all restaurants. It is a necessary step towards a healthier and more responsible society."
