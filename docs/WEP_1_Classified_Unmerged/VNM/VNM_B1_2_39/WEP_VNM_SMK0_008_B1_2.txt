"In today’s society, there is a social prejudice about the smoking in public areas such as restaurant, hotel…. Although some people suppose that it should be fully restricted to smoke in restaurant, the other still allow this activity. From my perspective, I agree that it should be limited but to a certain extent, and the following essay will state some reasons to support my viewpoint.
Regarding the health aspect of populations, smoking in the restaurants may detrimentally affect mental and physical well being. According to other research, our respiratory system can be damaged with the smoke from cigar, potentially people are more at risk of several illness, such as sore throat, asthma,....Particularly, restaurants may serve a range of customers from all ages, including the elderly, adults, and even babies in which some of they are allergic to the smoke. 
However, I’m more opposed to the opinion that it should completely eliminate smoking activities in those formal places. In some cases, restaurant may have a specific room for the smokers since it helps them to relieve their stress after a day of hard work. Besides, several eating places have been constructed in the opening atmosphere which not obviously affect surrounded customers. 
In conclusion, I concur that smoking in restaurant should be limited but not completely eradicated due to several reasons. Therefore, the restaurant should spend little spaces as smoking area to mitigate the effect of smoking on other customers. "
