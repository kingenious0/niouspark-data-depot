"I totally agree with the idea of banning smoking at all the restaurants in the country. 
First of all, the action of smoking itself is a risk for many chronic cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases such as: hypertension, dyslipidemia, aortic coarctation, Chronic obstruction pneumonia disease that is known as COPD, pulmonary cancer, and some researches recently prove that children inactively smoke by living with a smoking person will have more risk of having wheezes, women can have a more dangerous gestation by actively smoking. Understanding of the disadvantages of smoking, it is everyone’s duty to prevent this action.
Secondly, restaurants are considered as public places, so if one smoke, everyone in the same room with him or her will be actively smoked, including children, women with the possibility of having a gestation, or people having pulmonary diseases. Inactive smoking is a real thing, the risk of developing chronic diseases from smoking is the same for the actively smoking and inactively smoking person. If all the restaurants in the country ban smoking, the restaurant will obviously have fresher and healthier air for everyone. 
Finally, it is a social’s duty to prevent smoking. The restriction of smoking in all restaurants will be a strong message for everyone to have more concern thoughts about the disadvantages of smoking, and inspire people to have more actions on preventing smoking in the future.  "
