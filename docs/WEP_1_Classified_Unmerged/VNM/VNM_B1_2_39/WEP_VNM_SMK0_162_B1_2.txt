"I completely agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants across the country. It’s not only harmful to smokers themselves, but also to people around them, especially in public indoor places like restaurants.

Firstly, smoking affects non-smokers through secondhand smoke. When someone smokes in a restaurant, other customers have to breathe in the smoke too, which is very uncomfortable and dangerous. People go to restaurants to enjoy food and relax, not to inhale smoke. For example, I once went to a restaurant where a man was smoking nearby, and the smell ruined the whole meal for me. I even had to leave early.

Secondly, banning smoking can create a cleaner and more healthy environment. It also helps protect children, pregnant women, and people with breathing problems who may visit restaurants. I think a restaurant should be a safe place for everyone, not just for smokers.

However, some people argue that smokers have the right to smoke. But I think personal freedom should not affect other people’s health. They can smoke outside if they want, but not in public eating places.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that smoking should not be allowed in restaurants. It is dangerous, annoying, and unhealthy for other people. Making a ban is the best way to protect public health and create a better eating experience for everyone."
