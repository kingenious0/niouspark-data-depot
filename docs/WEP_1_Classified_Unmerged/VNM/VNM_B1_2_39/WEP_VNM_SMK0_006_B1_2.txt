"I strongly agree that smoking should be not allowed at all restaurants in the country. First and foremost, smoking poses significant health risks to both smokers and non-smokers. Secondhand smoke exposure can cause serious health issues, such as respiratory problems, heart disease, and even cancer. For instance, employees working in a smoking-permitted restaurant are at a higher risk of developing these health problems due to constant exposure. 

Moreover, banning smoking in restaurants creates a more pleasant dining environment for all customers. The smell of smoke can be unappetizing and bothersome, detracting from the overall dining experience. A family with children may avoid dining out if they know the restaurant allows smoking, thereby impacting the business negatively. By implementing a smoking ban, restaurants can attract a wider range of customers who appreciate a smoke-free environment.

Additionally, a smoking ban in restaurants promotes a healthier lifestyle and encourages smokers to reduce or quit smoking. Public policies that restrict smoking in certain areas have been shown to decrease smoking rates. Based on a large number of scientific research results, countries that have implemented smoking bans in public places have observed a decline in smoking prevalence among their populations.

In conclusion, completely banning smoking in all restaurants in the country is essential for protecting public health, enhancing the dining experience, and encouraging healthier habits. It is a necessary step towards creating a healthier and more enjoyable environment for everyone."
