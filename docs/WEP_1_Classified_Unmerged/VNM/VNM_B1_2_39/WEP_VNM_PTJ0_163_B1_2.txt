"I agree that It is important for college students to have a part-time job
As a second year college student in university, I think having a partime-job is very important, especially in a higher year. Because inside another income to support parents, It's a chance to push my skills when it is suitable for my major. However, the issue of how to balance working and studying still is a problem. If the student can not solve it, they burn-out easier than others.
I have a friend, she had an internship job at the first year in the university, after 3-month, she approved and became an employee of an agency where related to our marketing major besides being an excellent student in class.. I really admire her and I've also started sending my CV to recruiters until now, I still do not find my job that suitable. 

But I believe that having a partime job prepares us for our careers after graduate. If I have advice for a first year student after me, I will say that they can use the first year to be familiar with the university environment and letâ€™s start sending your CV to have a partime job related to your major and can help you have money.
