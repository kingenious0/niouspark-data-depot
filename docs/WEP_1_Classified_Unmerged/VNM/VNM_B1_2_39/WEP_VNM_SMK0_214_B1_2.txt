I agree with the statement. Nobody wants to inhale someone else’s cigarette smoke while enjoying meals. Not only at restaurants, but smoking should also be banned in all public areas. It maybe is an essential part of someone’s life since it helps release stress, but not for everyone. For example, I personally hate cigarette smoke, not just on the emotional level, it also makes me feel dizzy and hard to breathe. Since many restaurants are enclosed space, cigarette smoke will be strapped inside and therefore cause more harm than outside. If there are air conditioners, it’s even worse, the smell won’t go away for a long time. Even if the restaurants have open space, the smoke will linger long enough for everyone in the area to inhale it unwillingly. And I haven't even mentioned cigarette smoke effects on health. Long-term smoking will harm a person inside-out. It affects the look, leads to cancer, heart disease, addiction, etc... To sum it up, smoking in restaurants will cause trouble for the staff and make others uncomfortable. It also harms not only the one who smokes but also everyone around. Therefore, smoking should be banned in public areas like restaurants. If somebody needs to smoke, do it in private.
