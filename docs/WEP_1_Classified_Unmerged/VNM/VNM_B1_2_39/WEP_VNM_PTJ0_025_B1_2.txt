"People of different ages need money and college students are not the exception. A majority of people claim that college students should have a part-time job to address the issues related to finance. However, others think that college students should exclusively concentrate on their learning. In this essay, I will state a neutral point of view towards the following topic.
On the one hand, possessing a part-time job could foster the inner growth of students and help them to be more mature. To demonstrate, getting involved in the working environment is deemed to be complex as students could confront predicaments that they have not experienced before and be forced to adapt to uncomfortable circumstances. If they can overcome such difficulties, it is believed that they could develop a more stable mentality as well as confidence. 
On the other hand, spending too much time on part-time jobs could induce a decrease in academic performance among students. Particularly, higher education is an academically competitive environment. Without extra time spent on exercises outside the class, it could be a huge disadvantage for students since they could not further elaborate or expand their pool of knowledge. As a result, they would hardly achieve any prominent awards to benefit their after-college path.
In conclusion, having a part-time job could be an intriguing experience as it provides students with thoughtful insights. However, their learning at the university should also be taken into consideration. Indeed, gaining positive results at college could also create opportunities for their future career. "
