"We cannot deny that earning a living is one of the most important goals for a lot of people. However, each period of life has a specific aim. As a result, I believe that it is not too crucial for college students to get a temporary job. In this essay, I will prove my viewpoint clearly.

As students, studying is always a preference because this is the stage that they can absorb knowledge associated with the career they pursue without fear of being timeless. They should spend more time on classes so that they can get the highest mark on tests. Moreover, getting a good score is a plus in CV when they apply for a position after graduating from college.

On the other hand, college students should take part in curriculum activities, instead of working, to improve and enhance their soft skills such as communication skill, problem-solving skill, etc. Additionally, they should take time to enroll in courses involved in their major or join several contests. 

In conclusion, college students can get part-time jobs, but they should have a balance between working and studying. They should make use of student life to experience everything and prepare themselves perfectly before getting into society.
