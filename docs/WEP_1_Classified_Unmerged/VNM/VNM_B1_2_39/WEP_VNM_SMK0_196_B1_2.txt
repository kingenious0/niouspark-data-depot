"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Smoking is very bad for health. Not only the person who smoke gets sick, but also the people around them. If someone smokes in a restaurant, other people have to smell the smoke, and it can make them feel bad or even sick.
Restaurants are public places where people go to enjoy food and relax. If someone is smoking nearby, it can ruin the meal and make others feel uncomfortable. The smell of smoke can also stay on clothes and in the air for a long time, which is unpleasant for many people. Some people may even leave the restaurant early if there is too much smoke.
Also, no smoking makes restaurants more clean. No cigarette butts on the floor, and no bad smell in the air. It’s better for workers too, because they don’t have to stay in smoke all day. This helps them stay healthy and work better.
In conclusion, I believe smoking should not be allowed in any restaurant. It protects people’s health, makes the environment cleaner, and creates a better experience for all customers"
