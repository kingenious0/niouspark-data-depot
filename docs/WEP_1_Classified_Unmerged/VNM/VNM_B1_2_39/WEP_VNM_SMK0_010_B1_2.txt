"Health-conscious is one of the most significant concerns nowadays when everything has been operated in a rapid pace of digital era. Some people opine that cigarettes industry should be eliminated to bring back a healthy world. However, I do not have the same idea for 3 main reasons.
To commence with, it is factual that a phenomenon just becomes detrimental it has been over-abused over a long period of time, not apart from the existence of addictants. The pristine purpose of producing cigarettes is as a stress reduction substance and that value of it has still continued till recent days. In fact, there is no survey saying that life expectancy of a person will be affected if they just take 2 or 3 cigarettes a month. What’s more, the right amount of usage will stimulate working efficiency and maintain stable emotion. Secondly, the action of banning a product is not as easy as saying, it is actually relevant to a whole industry and rate of employment. If this decision is made internationally valid, millions of citizens will lose their job, leading to the degradation of economy and the strike in protests on a large scale. Finally, it is psychologically true that putting restriction is incline to resulting in opposite consequences. For example, going along the street of Viet Nam, you can easily catch some banning signs of throwing rubbish at the corner of somewhere, but instead of the maintance of a clean and fresh area, they have a full of trash piling up like a mountain. 
To conclude, I totally on the other side of this argument. However, I do think that the government should issue some restrictions on the amount of using or legal places to smoke for a civilized and controlled community. "
