"In my opinion, I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.

The first reason is that college students when they have a time -to -time job, they will gain practical experiences such as working skills, time management, and communication with people. These will help students have more soft skills, confident skills, learn how to handle situations and build relationships that may help their future work. In addition, to develop themselves, students can help cover living expenses, reduce the burden on the family by receiving salary from those part-time jobs. 

However, part-time jobs also affect students as some jobs are not related to the students' field. It may not be networked for long-term benefits, pressure and fatigue when working can be photos. Students should enjoy their rest because if there is no balance between learning, part-time and reasonable rest, that will make them prone to stress and stress. If students can arrange a reasonable time and choose a job that is suitable for the field of study, the part-time job will be very beneficial for students.

In conclusion, having a part-time job is necessary for students to have more skills and relationships, but they should balance between working and learning. "
