"Some people think that college students, who have a lot of spare time, having a part-time job is an essential activity after school. From my perspective, I partly agree with this statement on account of some reasons below. 

On the one hand, college students would spend much of money for university so that they should have a part-time job to cover personal expenses and reduce dependence on parents. Work experience is one of some benefits to have a part-time job because it builds some practical skills which enhance your resume for the future jobs. Moreover, students of university could build relationships through outside activities, so having a part-time job is such a great experience that they take networking opportunities for their future careers. 

On the other hand, having a half-time work could have some downsides by some reasons. College students may involve many tasks and homework after joining classes, it requires them to spend many hours to meet the deadline but part-time jobs would limit their time for doing homework and some social activities. Furthermore, they might face with academic pressure because they have to maintain the balance between work and studies, which can be stressful and affect academic performances.  

College students should get part-time jobs depending on their ability to manage their time and maintain the balance well. They can take advantage of half-time work to improve many requirements and help in their careers but students should ensure that part-time job doesn't negatively influence on their studies. "
