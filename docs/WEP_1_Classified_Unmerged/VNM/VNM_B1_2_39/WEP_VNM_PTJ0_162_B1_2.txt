"I personally agree that having a part-time job is important for college students. Even though it may be hard to balance studying and working, I think it brings more good than harm.

Firstly, doing part-time jobs helps students earn extra money. Many university students have to pay for daily things like food, clothes, or even tuition. With a part-time job, they can reduce the pressure on their parents and feel more independent. For example, I have a friend who teaches English to kids in the evening. He can pay for his rent and phone bill by himself, which is quite impressive.

Secondly, part-time work can give students useful skills. They can learn how to talk with people, manage time, and solve problems. These are real-life skills that are really helpful for the future. When they apply for a full-time job after graduation, they already have some experience, which makes them more confident and stand out from other candidates.

Of course, some students may spend too much time working and forget to study. But I believe that if they plan their schedule well, they can do both.

In conclusion, part-time jobs are helpful for college students. They bring money and experience, and also prepare them better for life after university."
