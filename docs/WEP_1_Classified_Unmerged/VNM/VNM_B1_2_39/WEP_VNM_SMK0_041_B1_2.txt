"It is said that completely banning smoking in all restaurants in the country is necessary for many reasons. Such a ban would significantly enhance public health, make dining out more enjoyable, and keep up with modern health standards. So, I strongly agree with the above statement. 

Firstly, a no smoking environment is much better for health. Smoke from cigarette is harmful and can cause serious health problem like lung disease and heart issues. When smoking is allowed in restaurants, both customers and staff are faced with these dangers. By banning smoking, we would protect everyone from the harmful effects of smoke, leading to better public health.
Secondly, banning smoke would make dining out more pleasant. Restaurants should be enjoyable places to eat, but smoke can make it uncomfortable. It can affect the state of food, make the air unpleasant, and annoy customers. A no smoking restaurant would ensure a more enjoyable experience for everyone. For example, when I go to the restaurant, I want to have time with my friends, my family, but everyone can be disturbed by smoke. We have to choose a separate area, so we are not really enjoy this moment together. 
Finally, a nationwide smoking ban in restaurants would show that we are keeping up with how other places handle health. Many countries have already made this change to improve health standards. 
In summary, banning smoke in all restaurants would protect health, enhance the dining experience, and keep up with modern health standards."
