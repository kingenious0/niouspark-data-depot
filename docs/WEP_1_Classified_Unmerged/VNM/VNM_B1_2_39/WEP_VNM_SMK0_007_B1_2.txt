"In recent years, there are some concerns about the act of allowing people to smoke in restaurants, leading some ideas that it should be completely banned. In my opinion, there are some other ways to avoid the harmfulness of smoking to people in restaurants but do no need to ban it completely. 
On the one side, smoking is definitely harmful to human’s health, which can make it being considered not good for restaurant environments. For example, it can cause people suffering from many lung diseases, especially lung cancer, one of the most leading causes of deaths worldwide. Additionally, some people might have some types of immune disorders, making them sensitive to smoke and trigger many serious reactions in a smoking environment. Lastly, smoking in restaurants could put some significant risks of causing fires there, which is definitely not a good news for anyone.
On the other side, there are several ways to avoid the effects of smoking in restaurants, without banning it completely. For instance, the restaurants’ owners can change the way they design rooms for their restaurants, by making specific areas for people to come there and smoke. Additionally, there should be some fire alarming systems to control and reduce the impacts of fires that might possibly occur while someone smoke. 
In conclusion, in spite of the harmfulness of smoking to human health, there are still several ways to prevent it from affecting people in the restaurants. Therefore, I think there should be some policies and changes to the ways of managing restaurants and control smoking without even banning it completely.
