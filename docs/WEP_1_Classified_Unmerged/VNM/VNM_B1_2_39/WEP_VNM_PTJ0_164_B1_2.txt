"In my opinion, it is crucial that a part-time job should be included in a university student’s plan. 
First of all, the initial reason for this is that attending the university requires a large amount of resources, including fees such as tuition fee, commuting, food and the most vital one for those living far from home is living cost. These sorts of costs are extremely extortionate for ones who are not having a fully financial condition. Therefore, securing a job would enable them to make ends meet. Moreover, doing a full-time job could deprive students from spending less time for their studying, thereby leading them to terrible grades at school and even failing the exam and paying twice to take the course they failed again. 
However, not everyone should take a part-time job, especially those who don’t have a good health condition. For example, they could easily get sick or can not carry heavy objects. These not only create drawbacks on their academic achievements but also the company they work for, as they have to take risk of these students not fulfilling their task but they still have to pay salary for them.
Lastly, I strongly agree with the point that students in university should have a job to make a living."
