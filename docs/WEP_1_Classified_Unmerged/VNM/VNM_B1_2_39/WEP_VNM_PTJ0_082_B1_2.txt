"In recent years, the university student working part-time is one of the extremely popular situations, it not only wastes time but also has a negative impact on classroom results. So I disagree.

In my opinion, every part-time student will cause a sense of lethargy, drowsiness whenever she finishes working, negatively affecting class hours in class. This causes extremely dangerous consequences, maybe a case that makes you get some money, but until the results are not good, you have to spend 3 to 4 times the money to pay for the educational money. From a person who wants to make money to help the family to become more costly, this is bad. 

But it must also be said that the part-time job also has its good aspects if you can take advantage of time, or if a student manages a good time or arranges a reasonable time, this is great, you can just have income for yourself and also study well in the lecture hall. 

In short, this depends on each individual, each person has his own way of thinking, and we cannot change their thoughts. So although I did not agree, I did not condemn this issue, because everyone had a private life."
