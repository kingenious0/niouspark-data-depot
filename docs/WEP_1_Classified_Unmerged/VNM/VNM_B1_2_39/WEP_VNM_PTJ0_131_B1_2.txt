"Is it reasonable to think that undergraduates should have part-time jobs. From my perspective, I agree with this idea because part-time jobs can help students earn money and improve their skills.

First of all, having a part-time job helps students earn money for their daily needs such as food, books, or transportation. This is very useful, especially for students from poor families. They do not need to ask their parents for money all the time. Besides, students can learn to manage their money better when they work and earn by themselves.

Moreover, working part-time allows students to learn important skills such as teamwork, time management, and communication. These skills will help them a lot when they graduate and look for a full-time job. For example, a student who works in a coffee shop will learn how to talk to customers and solve problems quickly.

In conclusion, I believe having a part-time job is good for college students if they know how to manage their time well. It helps them earn money and learn useful skills for their future."
