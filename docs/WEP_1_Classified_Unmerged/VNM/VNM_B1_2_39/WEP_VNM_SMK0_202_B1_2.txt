"I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. First of all, smoking creates a very uncomfortable environment for non-smokers. Many people go to restaurants to relax and enjoy their food but the smell of cigarette smoke can ruin their experience. It’s not fair for others to breathe in harmful smoke just because someone nearby is smoking.
Second of all, smoking is dangerous to health not just for smokers but also for those around them. Passive smoke can cause serious health problems such as lung cancer, asthma, and heart disease. Restaurants are public places where families and children also go so it is important to keep the air clean for everyone. Government should issue some resolution to prevent cigarette as levy high rate taxes on special goods, launch campaign in order to raise citizen’s awareness of smoking hazardous. 
Finally, banning smoking in restaurants can help reduce the number of smokers in general. If people cannot smoke in public, they may smoke less or even give up. This could lead to a healthier society. I believe smoking should not be allowed in any restaurant. Everyone deserves to enjoy their meal in a clean and smoke-free environment."
