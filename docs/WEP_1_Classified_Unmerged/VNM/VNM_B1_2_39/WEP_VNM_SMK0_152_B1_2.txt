"Smoking problem is a hard problem to solve. In my opinion, i totally agree that smoking should be banned at all the restaurant in the country.
Firstly, smoking cause a very unpleasure place. When almost customers come to the restaurant to spend their time with people their love, having a people who smoke can make other customers feel uncomfortable with its smell. 
Secondly, if there are people who smoke, it is not only have effect on smoker but also people around them. The smoke's smell have badly effect on health such as lung cancer, so it is better to be banned smoking.
Finally, when the restaurant banned smoking, air quality is improved. And if the air is clean, customers can use their meal with the better mood, that cause good effect for restaurant. 
In conclusion, smoking should be banned at all the restaurant in the country. That would create a better health for another one, and also helps the restaurant have a plus point for customer, because most of people want to have a good place to enjoy their meal after a working day.
