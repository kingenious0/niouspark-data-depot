"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. I think restaurants are places where people come to enjoy food and relax, so they should have a clean and comfortable environment for everyone.
First, smoking is not good for health, not only for smokers but also for people around them. Many people don’t like the smell of smoke when they are eating. Sometimes it even makes the food taste worse. Breathing in secondhand smoke can also be dangerous for children, old people, or anyone who has health problems.
Second, banning smoking helps create a nicer atmosphere. Imagine going to a restaurant to have a fun meal with friends, but the whole place smells bad because of cigarettes. If restaurants are clean and fresh, people will enjoy their time there more.
Of course, I understand that smokers may feel uncomfortable if they can’t smoke. But they can always go outside the restaurant to smoke if they want. That way, both smokers and non-smokers can feel okay, and nobody’s meal will be ruined by smoke.
In short, I think banning smoking at restaurants is a good idea. It makes the space better for everyone and helps protect people’s health at the same time."
