"In Vietnam, it is a common fact that smoking is harmful to people’s health. Thus, a mass majority of people reject the use of cigarettes in public places, for example, restaurants. In this essay, I will demonstrate an endorsement of the policy of total smoking restriction at all restaurants nationwide. 
Regarding health, smoking is the major reason for severe diseases, most typically lung cancer. Cigarettes consist of numerous components, including nicotine, a detrimental chemical that causes cancer. There have been reports on the increase in cases related to lung cancer throughout the world. This could result from the early use of cigarettes among youngsters. Therefore, the use of cigarettes should be moderated.
Cigarettes are not only harmful for smokers but also for individuals who accidentally inhale. Public places, such as restaurants, have a huge number of people gathering around. With only a sufficient amount of smoke escaping from the cigarettes could induce negative impacts to the crowd nearby. So, the act of completely banning smoking is highly necessary for the safety and the consolidation of public health. 
In short, I agree that smoking should be eliminated for the reasons mentioned above. By doing so, the world could witness a decrease in lung cancer, and community health would be ensured and protected."
