"Nowadays, skills play an important role for college students. For me, it's important for them to have a part-time job.
First of all, as i have mentioned, having a part-time job help them improve their soft skills, such as communication, problem-solving. While doing their job, their have chance to meet more people to communicate, more circumstantial in real-life and know how to solve them. Moreover, they also can try to teamwork with their colleague, especially when working in customer service role. These skills are not taught in school, so it is important in workspace. Secondly, it help college students earn money for their daily need of their life. They can be no longer depend on their parents, which is good for them. 
Finally, having a part-time job can also help their gain more experience. That means while they doing their job, it helps them gain experience for real, not just on theory.
