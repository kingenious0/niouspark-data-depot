"I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Smoking in public places, especially where people eat, is not only unpleasant but also harmful to others.
First, smoking is a serious health hazard. Secondhand smoke contains toxic chemicals that can harm non-smokers, including children and the elderly. When people smoke in restaurants, everyone nearby breathes in dangerous fumes. This puts the health of customers and restaurant staff at risk, even if they donâ€™t smoke themselves.
Second, smoking ruins the dining experience. The smell of cigarette smoke can make food taste and smell worse. People go to restaurants to enjoy their meals in a clean and comfortable environment. Smoke in the air is not only unhealthy, but also disrespectful to those who do not smoke.
Furthermore, banning smoking can improve the image of restaurants. More families, young people, and health-conscious customers will feel welcome. In fact, many countries that have banned smoking in public places have seen positive results, including cleaner air, better public health, and happier customers.
Some might argue that smokers have a right to smoke, but personal freedom should not harm others. People can still smoke in private places, but public spaces like restaurants should be smoke-free zones.
In conclusion, banning smoking in all restaurants is the right thing to do. It protects health, improves the dining environment, and supports a cleaner, safer society."
