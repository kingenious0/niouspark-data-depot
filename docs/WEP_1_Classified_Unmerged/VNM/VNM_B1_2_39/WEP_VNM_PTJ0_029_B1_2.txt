"Nowadays, students studying at the university make end meet to help their family. It can be given by many reasons.
On the one hand we can get is supplemental income. Many college students face significant financial burdens, including tuition fees, textbooks. A part-time job can provide much-needed income to help cover these costs. Besides, earning and managing money can teach students important financial skills, such as budgeting, saving, and understanding the value of money.
On the second hand, part-time positions may be less stable, with fewer guarantees of long-term employment. Employers might prioritize full-time employees during restructuring.
However, it takes some disadvantages, it wastes much time instead of doing other things or you can study better your specialties with flying colors. Furthermore, it also has lower status and recognition. Part-time employees might not be perceived as integral members of the team and may receive less recognition for their contributions. Finally Limited Skill Development: Some part-time jobs may offer fewer opportunities to learn new skills or gain valuable experience compared to full-time positions.
In conclusion, I think although part time job play some crucial role but it also has some significative inconvenient when you discuss this problem. The best solution is that we need to balance between two thing so that we can find the method effectively."
