"i agree with that idea because when a college students have part time job they can have more money to using also they know is rely hard to earn money. from that they have more respect with money that parent spent for them to the university and have better life. When we go out and have a part time job it also can practice english when we have to talk with our customer or just talk to partner , for who got the trend introverted get a part time job can improve the social skill to get better in communication. Get new job that mean we know more friend and more experiment for future. have a part time job that got a lot of adventage 
if we do a great job like from waiter to manager in five guys or any restaurent or the convenient we can have alot in come and good at finance can open we realationship. It may can pay for college bill. for me am a college student i have work in the sushi shop and can bring some free food to home and eat like dinner it save a lot money."
