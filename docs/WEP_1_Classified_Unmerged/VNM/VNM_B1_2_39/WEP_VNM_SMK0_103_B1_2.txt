"Smoking is known as a harmful habit of many people in society. Banning smoking in restaurant has been a hot topic of discussion for many years. In my opinion, I agree with the reasons why smoking should be completely prohibited. 

To begin with, smoking should be banned due to its negative impact on health and environment, over dining experiences for restaurant's customers. Smoke contains many harmful chemicals that can cause serious diseases such as heart problems and lung cancer for human. Non-smokers, children and pregnant women, even restaurant staff that are exposed to these dangers when smoking is allowed in public place. In addition, the smell of cigarette smoke can be unpleasant for the dining experience for non-smokers. By banning smoking, restaurants would be fresher, more enjoyable environment leading to increased business and customer satisfaction.

Moreover, cigarette smoke not only affects human health but also contributes to the environmental pollution. Smoke lingers in the air, making it difficult to breathe and reduce the quality of atmosphere. Banning smoking sets a good example for younger generations by promoting clean air and healthy habits. Over time, such measures can lead to a decline in smoking-related diseases and pollution environment. 

The benefits of banning smoking in restaurant outweigh the drawbacks. Public health should be prioritized so people should be more aware of the harmful effects of smoking for individuals and society.   "
