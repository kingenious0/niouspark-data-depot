"Undergraduates nowadays are expected to not only be academically capable but also have the experience to get a job.

The aim of this essay is to shed light on how a part-time job contributes to the overall success of college students, as well as underscoring aspects of which students should be aware to fully utilize part-time job.
A part-time job is a work position where people devote a certain amount of their day to work in exchange for financial gain. It is notable that part-time jobs only require employees to work for 4 to 5 hours, whereas a typical nine-to-five job would take 8 to 10 hours daily, and part-time jobs are highly flexible. With the nature of a part-time job, college students can earn money while attending undergraduate programs. Hence, a part-time job can help students develop their soft skills and gain confidence. In addition, students who work part-time can learn how to manage their time, as they are required to juggle between work and study at their educational institutions. Nevertheless, a part-time job can be the cause that affects students’ academic achievement. Most students are not equipped with knowledge on how to manage their time effectively, hence causing students to multi-task between their work and study assignments at their institutions. 
In conclusion, while a part-time job might help students to gain experience and develop their skills at work, students who are unable to manage their time can suffer as a result. Therefore, it is essential that undergraduates equip themselves with time-management skills in addition to the support from their institutions, parents, and experts."
