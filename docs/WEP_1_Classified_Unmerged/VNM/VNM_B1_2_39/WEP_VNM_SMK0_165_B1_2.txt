I agree with the essay that "Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country". Smoking is bad for health, not just for the smoker but also for others around. Secondhand smoke can cause problems like cough, heart issues, and even cancer. By banning smoking in restaurants, we can keep people safe, especially kids, older people, and those with health issues who are more sensitive to smoke. Also, restaurants are places for people to enjoy food and talk with friends. When there is smoke, it can make people feel uncomfortable and ruin the meal. The smoke smell stays on clothes, food, and in the air, which makes customers not want to stay. Banning smoking will make the restaurant a better place to eat and keep everyone healthy. A smoking ban can also help smokers to stop or smoke less. Many places already ban smoking, so adding this rule to restaurants would show that smoking is not allowed in indoor public spaces. This will help lower smoking rates and create a healthier society. Therefore, I strongly agree with the idea of completely banning smoking in restaurants across the country.
