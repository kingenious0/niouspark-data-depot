"I agree that smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants.

First, smoking is very bad for people’s health. It not only affects the person who smokes, but also the people around them. This is called secondhand smoke. When someone smokes in a restaurant, other people, including children and old people, breathe the smoke. This can make them sick. Everyone should have the right to eat in a clean and healthy place. Second, smoking in restaurants makes the air smell bad. People go to restaurants to enjoy their meals. If someone is smoking, it is hard to enjoy the food. The smell of smoke can stay on clothes, furniture, and food. Many people feel uncomfortable when someone smokes near them. Also, banning smoking in restaurants can help more people stop smoking. When smoking is not allowed in public places, smokers may smoke less or try to quit. This is good for their health and for society.

In conclusion, I think smoking should not be allowed in any restaurant. It will protect people’s health, make restaurants cleaner, and help smokers change their habits. A smoke-free place is better for everyone."
