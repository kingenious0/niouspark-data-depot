"Some people argue that it is not necessary to prohibit smoking in all the restaurants, while others believe that smoking should not be allowed in restaurants in their country. I am better convinced of the latter idea for the following reasons.

First of all, smoking is very dangerous for both smokers and non-smokers. When someone smokes in a restaurant, other people around them can breathe in the smoke, which is called secondhand smoke. This can cause many health problems like lung disease or heart problems. People go to restaurants to enjoy their meals, not to get sick.

Secondly, smoking makes the restaurant air smell bad. The smell of cigarettes can mix with the food and make it taste and smell worse. This can be very uncomfortable for non-smokers, especially children and old people. For example, if a family goes to a restaurant and someone smokes nearby, they may want to leave and never come back.

In conclusion, I believe smoking should be banned in all restaurants. This will protect peopleâ€™s health and make restaurants cleaner and more enjoyable places for everyone."
