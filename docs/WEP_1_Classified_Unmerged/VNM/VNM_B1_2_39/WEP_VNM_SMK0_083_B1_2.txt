"Some people believe that smoking at restaurants is not a problem, others think that is not good, but in my point of view, I totally agree with the above view. In this day and age, smoking is an alarming issue, because it not only affects the health of smokers, but smoke also has a significant impact on people around them. Therefore, smoking in the restaurant should be completely banned.

The restaurant is home to many people, smoking in the restaurant will affect many people, not only makes customers uncomfortable by smoke, but it also affects children and pregnant women when They come to the restaurant. Besides, it also seriously affects the experience of eating, other customers will feel unhappy when they are eating with the smell of toxic smoke. Completely banning smoking in the restaurant will protect the health of both customers and store staff, creating a clean and safe environment for everyone to experience eating here. That not only increases the economy of the restaurant but also creates a good reputation when there is protection to customer health.

I think the restaurant should have actions to protect the health of people, improve the message of non-smoking and create a clean and safe environment to the health of customers."
