"I firmly think that smoking ought to be prohibited in all dining establishments. This is because it makes eating uncomfortable and endangers the health of others.

Health is the first explanation. Many people, including elderly people and children, visit restaurants with their families. Some clients might suffer from heart problems, allergies, or asthma. Smoke from nearby smokers may exacerbate these conditions. Secondhand smoke can have an impact on healthy individuals as well. Everyone is entitled to clean air, particularly in public settings like dining establishments.

The other big problem with smoking in restaurants is the awful smell and the overall atmosphere. As soon as one person lights up, the stale smoke drifts around and clings to everything. That odor drowns the aroma of freshly cooked meals and leaves patrons feeling uneasy. Diners come to unwind, savor good food, and shouldnt have to inhale unwanted fumes. An entirely smoke-free space simply smells cleaner, feels brighter, and welcomes everyone. Sure, some people argue that smokers should be free to light up wherever they please. Yet individual freedom cant come at the cost of public health for guests and staff alike. A sensible compromise is to set up comfortable smoking zones well away from doors and windows. That way smokers still have a place to indulge while most diners stay breathing easy. Banning cigarettes inside restaurants remains the best call for everyones wellbeing.

In short, the rule protects customers health, creates a nicer atmosphere, and keeps restaurants full and thriving."
