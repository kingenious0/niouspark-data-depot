"As the constant development of today society, everything seems to be priceyer than in the past. The majority of students who follow advanced learning need to take a part time job to meet the bills of high level programs and basic living condition. To me, I think it is just a natural tendency and apparent result of digital era for a few reasons. 
To start with, not only does part-time job bring forth monetary value but also a great deal of social experience. Youngsters will have great chances to interact with different kinds of people outside their school, hence, they will improve soft skill, problem-solving skill, team-working skill in a long term. Secondly, some students would love to join in corporations relating to their major, which will give them a few achievements and valuable experience to fulfil their cv after graduation. It is obvious that companies and organizations prefer an attendant with a lot of experience and sufficient mettle from reality to the one just giving out academic qualifications at school without a single real-life knowledge confirmation. Last but not least, the main reason why the rate of students joining part-time industry has rocketed so far is financial burden. Entering university means opening the world of maturity for that reason they have more stuffs to worry about than just focusing on studying like it used to be in the past such as the school fee, electricity bill, water bill, food and drink.
In summary, it is true that students should spend time for educational purpose but the benefits of having a part-time job is undeniable and adolescents who has the ability to balance working and studying will cultivate fruitful achievements in the future."
