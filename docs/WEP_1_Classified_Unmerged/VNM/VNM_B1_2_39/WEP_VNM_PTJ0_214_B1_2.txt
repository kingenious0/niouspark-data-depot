I agree with the statement. When I went to college, my parents told me that I had to focus on studying not making money. Therefore, I didn’t have any part-time job until my 4th year. But I didn’t graduate on time, so I worked part-time to distract myself. I’m an introvert and haven’t changed at all in my 4-year long period at college – gloomy and never interact with others. When I worked part-time in a coffee shop, the environment changed, I must communicate with my colleges. They inspired me a lot. I realized that it’s not that scary to talk with a stranger or ask someone for help. My family also commented that I smiled more. Although my part-time job has nothing to do with my major, it helped me develop my soft skills and gain some confidence. But everything has its own pros and cons, due to my weak personality, I couldn’t refuse others’ requests though some of them are inconvenient for me and therefore neglected my study. It made me stressed and became insecure. I had to learn how to say no and set my boundaries the hard way. So even though there are some down sides, I still think having a part-time job is important for college students.
