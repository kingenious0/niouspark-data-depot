"Nowadays, most people have a habit of smoking, and it is gradually rejuvenating to young people, not as middle-aged as before, most of them are dragged into these evils. I have also encountered cases where people casually smoke in public places and in restaurants and bars. This is not good at all, so I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.

Smoking in restaurants is not normal as people think, because the restaurant has all classes, everyone is at risk of infection with unnecessary problems with smoke, in addition to smoke. The drug affects more people inhaled more to the sucker, affecting the elderly, young children and pregnant women more than that. 

Smoking in restaurants causes loss of traditions and affects the reputation of that restaurant, so each restaurant needs its own measures to prevent this continued, can be banned or built. So a separate smoking room, but for me to build a separate smoking room is not optimal because they may not go there to breathe each other's smoke? So for me, it should be completely banned from smoking in restaurants, a luxurious, romantic space with candles and flowers that cannot let smoke destroy all. So each person has a unique point of view and no one is like anyone, maybe I think so, but some people think differently.

In short, everything has two opposing thoughts and it depends on how you think. But with this topic, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
