"I strongly agree with the opinion that emphasizes the importance of a part-time job for college students as long as students can balance between studying at school and having part-time job because of the benefits a part-time job can give them. 
First of all, they’ll have extra money, that can help with living expenses to have less burden on their family, or they can use it as savings for their important goals in the future. 
Secondly, having a part-time job for college students is a helpful way for them to explore the working field and having social networks that will benefit them in the future. Nowadays, students can easily find a part-time job that is related to their major in college. It’s easy for students in logistic, computer science or travel field to find related part-time job. Even in some major that is hard to think about having a part-time job such as the medical field, students can find a part-time job related to clinics, and clinical researches at school. That job can help medical students approach to the patients, have a brief understanding of what they will do with their job and build social network with seniors to mentor them.
Thirdly, students can develop plenty of soft skills when having a part-time job. For example, time management skills and planning skills will obviously developed well when they can balance between having a job and studying at school. Other remarkable skills such as social communication skills, money management skills that are raised when having a part-time job is helpful in the future. 
Finally, having a part-time job is a great way for students to explore themselves, knowing what fits them better, to have a more focus studying and training for the job they chose. "
