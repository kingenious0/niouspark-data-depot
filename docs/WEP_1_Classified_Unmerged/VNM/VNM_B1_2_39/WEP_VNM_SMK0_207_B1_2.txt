"Nowadays, smoking is a serious health problem in many countries. Some people believe that smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants. I agree with this idea because smoking in public places, especially restaurants, can harm others and create an unhealthy environment.
On the one hand, smoking could do harm to the other’s health. Firstly, smoking in restaurants is dangerous for non-smokers. To be specific, many people who go to restaurants do not smoke and they can be affected by second-hand smoke. Since smoke can cause health problems such as lung disease, especially for children, elderly people, and pregnant women. Secondly, smoking in restaurants can make the place smell bad and reduce the quality of the dining experience. The smell of smoke can mix with the smell of food and make it unpleasant for customers.
In addition, smoking offer some adverse image that cause impact to the restaurant. First of all, smoking in restaurants can hurt the restaurant’s reputation. For example, if a restaurant allows smoking, it may lose customers, especially families and people who are sensitive to smoke. The smell of smoke also makes the dining experience worse and can leave a bad impression. As a result, the restaurant may lose some customers. Secondly, smoking indoors is a fire risk. If someone smokes carelessly or throws away a cigarette that is still burning, it could cause a fire. Therefore, this is dangerous for both staff and guests, and it could destroy the restaurant and preventing this risk is very important for safety.
In conclusion, I believe that the government and some restaurants should implement the strict rules that completely banned the smoking in all restaurants. Furthermore, it also helps protect people’s health and creates a better space for everyone. "
