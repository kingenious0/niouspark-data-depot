"I disagree that Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.

I know that smoking is very harmful to us and people around us. But as I saw my father, he has smoked for many years and a day without smoking is not for him, he can feel uncomfortable, tired and the heart drops faster.
So if we go to a restaurant where smoking is completely banned, My father and me will not have a good experience. This will lead to the decrease of revenue of restaurants.
Not only him, the rate of smoking people is higher and higher day by day, and the rate of smoking people going to any restaurant in the country is very high. This can be terrible for any restaurant and for the economy of a country.

But smoking in the restaurant can be harmful to other people like I said below, so I think the restaurant can have a aera available for smoking and do not affect people in the restaurant. Or the country can decrease the quantity of cigarettes sold in the market so we can drop out the rate of people who start smoking. The design around the cigarettes has no affected to awareness of customer, be drop out the quantity of cigarettes is a good idea for me.
