"Part-time employment is reportedly common among college students, and depending on the circumstances, this could be an issue or just be a typical occurrence. Regarding this circumstance, there are differing opinions; some argue in favor of and against college students doing a part-time job. I believe there are a lot of elements that go into deciding whether or not undergraduate students have a part-time employment.

One the one hand, there are a number of reasons why college students work part-time jobs. Some students come from low-income homes, and since they are unable to pay for all of their education, they are forced to take part-time jobs in order to support their family. International students typically take part-time jobs, live far from home, and their parents have to work very hard to support them financially so they can pursue their education abroad. In addition, a lot of students wish to receive experience in the workplace since they believe it would help them advance their careers and open up more options.

However, there are other viewpoints that oppose the notion of part-time employment for college students. Students are likely to become sidetracked from their academic work when they take on a job. There are instances where college students are excessively preoccupied with making ends meet, work long hours, and struggle to strike a balance between employment and school. Their inability to efficiently manage their time leads to them making mistakes, which is the issue.

In conclusion, I think undergraduate students who are able to manage their time well between employment and studies can work a part-time job.
