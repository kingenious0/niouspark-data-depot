"Over the past few years, there has been a debate of whether or not the public should ban completely at all the restaurants in the country.  Some may disagree with that idea because they believe that it is the invasion of privacy. From my point of view, I agree that it is urgent to have a strict rule to ban smoking at all restaurants in the country.

First and foremost, smoking not only does harm to the individual but also to the people around him or her. Many scientific research has pointed out that the chemical in tobacco has an adverse influence on the respiratory system as well as cardiovascular system. If an individual has this bad habit for a long time, he or she has a potential to catch up with some dangerous disease like cancer or tuberculosis. Specifically, it has a bad influence on pregnant women and her babies. Moreover, restaurant is a public space, so its emission can spread rapidly to many people in the short term.

Secondly, another basis to completely ban smoking in restaurants is to preserve the quality of dining experience. The smell of cigarette smoke can ruin the taste of food and drink quickly, which makes it unpleasant for other diners. Taking my experience last week as an example, when I went to a Korean restaurant to take part in my friendâ€™s birthday, a man smoking beside my table made us feel extremely annoyed and we had to change our place immediately. As a result, in a smoke-free environment, customers can fully enjoy the flavors of their food. 

 Taking all of the aforementioned ideas into consideration, launching a campaign to set a rule to abandon smoking at restaurants is very urgent nowadays."
