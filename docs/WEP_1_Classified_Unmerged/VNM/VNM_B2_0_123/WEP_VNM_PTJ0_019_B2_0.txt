"There is a saying that students having part-time jobs during their time in college is essential.  In my opinion, working part-time is beneficial for students in terms of improving their soft skills. However, it would be best if they could balance the time spent studying in school and working as well as find a job that is related to their future fields.
In Vietnam, undergraduate courses generally take about 4 years, and longer for some specific ones to finish. In my opinion, graduating from university in Vietnam is not that hard since most schools report a high to nearly-complete graduation rate. However, in my point of view, for students to gain the most amount of knowledge possible about their always-changing career while preparing themselves with different skills, are not easy tasks, let alone having to divide some of their time for part-time jobs.
Though, we can’t deny the fact that joining the workforce early does come with gaining experiences that are going to benefit them greatly later in life. Students could get a chance to interact more with customers and employees, learning how they should communicate and what they might have to do to be qualified for the job market after their graduation. Moreover, earnings from the job could help students cover their tuition fees or simply spend on their personal interests.
