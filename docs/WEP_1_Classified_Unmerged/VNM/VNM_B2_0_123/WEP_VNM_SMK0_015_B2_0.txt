"It is true that smoking in public is the illegal thing, especially in restaurant. People who complete this thing should be banned, I totally agree with this idea.
Firstly, the wastes from the cigarette will affect people respiratory system negatively. When these wastes come to the pulmonary, it will damage the lungs. Moreover it will cause some chronic diseases related to respiratory system. People cannot breath naturally that’s why they have no opportunities to join some sport activities or to enjoy the longevity life. Secondly, these wastes will destroy peoples’ meals. Most restaurants own variety air conditional that’s why these waste will cover these restaurants so  people cannot own a comfortable space to eat and talk with their partner or their families. Thirdly, these behavior will put an significant impact on teenagers. Adolescence can easily imitate some behavior they think they can do and society will be cover with various wastes from cigarette. This will show that the peoples’ health will not be ensure in the future. Therefore, authority should give some punishments to those who smoke in public and they should educate people the effect of smoking in order to decline the proportion of this behaviors or they can increase the price of cigarette or put some taxes in it
In conclusion, smoking is legal, but people should have an awareness to avoid some public spaces such as restaurant or bus."
