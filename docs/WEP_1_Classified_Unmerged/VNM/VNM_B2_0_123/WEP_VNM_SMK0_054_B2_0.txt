"Modern society has normalized smoking as something that individuals do on a regular basis, making it popular everywhere. Because smoking has such detrimental effects, some individuals believe that it should not be permitted in restaurants. For a few reasons, in my opinion, I concur with the earlier viewpoint.
Given the negative effects smoking has on people's health, it is one thing to say that smoking should be outlawed in all restaurants. Everyone in the vicinity of a smoker will be able to smell the smoke. Human health can suffer from passive cigarette smoke. For example, pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of smoking because it can harm the developing fetus as well as affect their own health. Additionally, smoking in restaurants can negatively impact the dining experience of other patrons by impairing their ability to concentrate on their food and spoiling their enjoyment of it.
Additionally, smoking has some negative effects that put patrons' safety in jeopardy. Smoking close to a fire is dangerous, especially in restaurants where fire is constantly used for cooking. In addition, other items like carpets, furniture, and curtains can easily catch fire. All restaurants can reduce the risk of unintentional fires and give their patrons a safe environment by outlawing smoking.

In conclusion, I think smoking ought to be outlawed because the negative effects outweigh the positive ones.
