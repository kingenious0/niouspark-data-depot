"Many people said that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. In my point of views, I strongly agree with this opinion.
 When students graduated from high school, they have enough knowledge and soft skills to do a part-time job such as cashier in the convenient stores, server in the restaurants. In addition, if they have a good teaching skill, they can be a tutor of children. Having a part time job, students can practice and learn more skills to be more confident and have experience. For example, to be a cashier they have to be careful and have a good calculate skill. Besides, fees in the college nowadays is very expensive so doing some part time jobs can help them pay for the fees and let them know how to earn and save money. 
However, some part-time job environments are not safe. Students can be scammed by many things such as lost money, … Therefore, having a part-time job is important to develop skills and earn money but sometimes, students cannot balance their time to study and they are distracted by money and jobs. 
To conclusion, students should choose a suitable part-time job which can help develop them skills and earn money but not bring a bad effect on the study in college."
