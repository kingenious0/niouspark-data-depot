"In the modern world with more advanced technology, it becomes harder for students to have a dream job as the labor market demands a variety of skills from employees. Therefore, I agree with the statement that it is crucial for college students to have a part-time job. 

One important reason is enhancing some soft skills for students. When they have a chance to get a part-time job, they will know how to manage their time, balance their study and their job. It will boost their time management skills which many companies need from their employees. It is quite hard to do both things in the best way, so if they can do that, they might be a potential person for some company.  

Another reason is that it will also improve students' knowledge. If they apply for a job that is relative to their future job, they will have more opportunities to use their knowledge which they learned at college in real life. They may be aware of their mistakes through working, so they have experience might fix it in the future. For example, one student studied hotel management and he used to be a waiter at a restaurant. So he probably applied his experience in hotel management and it is his own strength in this field.

In conclusion, going to have a part-time job gives more benefits for college students in the future. It improves them from the soft skill to the hard one."
