"      It is argued that students should have a part-time job while studying at the colleges or universities. I completely agree with this opinion because this would contribute to the development of the students themselves and help them overcome some economic difficulties if they have. 

      It should be noted that doing a part-time job would develop some important skills for students. In other words, via communications and cooperation with people outside their university, they would have more practical experience which is beneficial for their future work. For example, when they work in a restaurant, they have to know how to be polite and friendly in order to bring the best service to customers. Every job has its own lessons and students can learn it while exposing themselves to these environments. Moreover, students can enhance their time management skills and social skills which are considered as one of the most important skills for future employers. 

      Especially for students who have difficulties in the economy, part-time jobs are the lifesaver for them. It is because they can earn their own money, affording the basics of their life. Almost all students these days choose to go to the big cities for education so economic pressures are considerably great for them including renting, food, tuition fee, etc. 

      In conclusion, I believe that college students should participate in working part-time to support their life and develop some important skills. "
