"Nowadays, there is a trend showing that college or university students look for a part-time job to earn money themselves. And I support them to have a part-time job. This essay will show the reasons why.

On the one hand, doing a part-time job after school can have some drawbacks. Firstly, it distracts students from studying. To be more specific, when students are addicted to work, they might not spend enough time on their academic study such as self-learning, self-researching, etc. Consequently, their results might not be good, which affects their emotions so well and somehow makes them disappointed. Besides, having a part-time job might have bad result in a long-term. For example, if students work part-time, there are few jobs that are related to their major, so they might forget a lot of knowledge about their major.

On the other hand, it seems to me that a part-time job has some advantages. Firstly, it helps students satisfy with their life. For example, college students can have more money to do what they love without asking their parents, sometimes they are no longer finance burden for their family. In addition, part-time job makes their lives more exciting! To be clearer, when they have free time, instead of playing computer games, they can go outside and work, which brings them a profusion of soft-skills that are important to their future.

In conclusion, although there are some disadvantages of doing part-time job, I extremely believe that the advantages discussed above outweigh the disadvantages, so I support the idea "It is important for college students to have a part-time job."
