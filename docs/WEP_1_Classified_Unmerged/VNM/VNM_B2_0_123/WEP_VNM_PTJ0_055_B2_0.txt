"Some people said that college students should do the jobs beside studying, some said differently. Personally, I partly agree with this point of view, and in the following essay, I will prove my idea with evidence.

Regarding the former view point, part-time jobs help students in many fields. Firstly, there is no denial that part time jobs help students to release the major financial burden. They can help parents to pay for bills such as food, study materials as well as more freedom in spending money. Secondly, some students do the part time jobs in order to improve their skill. As we can see there are a lot of companies that hire college students as they are very dynamic and willing to study new things. As they work, they can improve their communication skills, or solve the problems more professionally.

However, there are some drawbacks that we cannot avoid. Firstly, some students are immersed in doing part time jobs because they want to make more money, so that they cannot concentrate on studying while study is their major thing to do. Additionally, some students are not mature enough to avoid some basic mistakes at work as well as get cheated.

Overall, part time jobs have their disadvantages and advantages. Personally, I agree with the point that college students should do part time jobs because you can make mistakes to learn more and be more mature.
