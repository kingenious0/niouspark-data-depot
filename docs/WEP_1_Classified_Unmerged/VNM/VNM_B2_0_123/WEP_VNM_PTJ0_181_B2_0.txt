Now, I am a student at university in Vietnam, and I have joined 3 part-time jobs. In my case, the main reason why I am looking for a job is just because of money, not about experience. Being a student, I still need more money to pay for my learning fees, rent and other fees. Living in a city - which is not my countryside, no parents take care. I have to take good care for myself and my sister, and that was not easy. So I very much agree with this topic "It  is important for college students to have a part-time job." One more thing that Topic must agree on is ‘try’. If I don't try, I will never discover my strength. My part-time job is just manual work, and knowledge I get more is about social knowledge. Thanks for that, I can save lots of time in defining myself and keep moving in the future. But, for people who have a strong financial base, and want to use 100% energy in learning. In that case, they don't need to have a part-time job. Because their parents work so hard to hope they can live and learn without thinking about it. It is about their thinking and part-time job not like a ‘must have item’ that every student tries to have. They can use their time in another work still bring values for them.
