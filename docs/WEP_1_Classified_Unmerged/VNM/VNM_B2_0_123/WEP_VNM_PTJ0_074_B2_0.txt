"It is said that college students should not have a part-time job because it may distract them from learning. From my perspective, I strongly disagree with that opinion because it is necessary for the students to earn money from the part-time job during college time. This essay will discuss two reasons relating to this.

Firstly, while the parents must take responsibility to pay the tuition fee, which means that the college students do not need to be nervous about money, there still are numerous households whose financial condition is not enough to raise a child up to college. Although many governments had promulgated many policies in order to help the lower-class people continue to learn in the colleges. The students coming from the lower class are also nervous about their financial condition. It is because they must not only take care of tuition fees, but they also have to worry about their use of money in daily life, such as transportation, food, etc. Therefore, it is necessary for them to have a part-time job in order to continue maintaining their lives.

Secondly, by earning money during college time, students can gain more experience before joining the markets. Even though the part-time jobs that they do are not related to their major, these jobs can help them get familiar with the working environment. For instance, if the students work for F&B business, they can learn how to communicate with customers. This will create confidence whenever they meet people, it is one of the important skills that every student should have before graduating from college.

In conclusion, I strongly agree that the students can earn money from a part-time job because not only does it help students with money, but it also provides them with necessary experiences which are helpful for their future career."
