"A school of thought holds that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. In my point of view, smoking causes many bad effects and it should be limited especially in public areas like restaurants which is why I agree with this statement. To start with, It is known that cigarettes contain many kinds of toxin material. It causes severe health problems such as heart disease and various cancers - lung, throat, mouth cancer… Moreover, not only smokers who have to suffer through illness but also people who consume smoke from cigarettes. This is the main reason why smoking should be banned in public, especially restaurants where eating can lead to more smoke consumption from customers. Secondly, smoke in restaurants creates an unpleasant place with bad air quality and an annoying view. Restaurants that allow smoking are likely to have fewer children, elderly and pregnant women as customers. Last but not least, it is each person's responsibility to care for other people as we all live in a large community. Smokers should be aware of their smoking actions to not harm other people’s health which means they have to reduce smoking in public areas. The law of banning smoking in restaurants not only creates more positive impacts on public health but also fosters a more responsible community. In conclusion, a nationwide ban on smoking in all restaurants is a victory for public health. Fresh air should be ensured in every meal out for everyone.
