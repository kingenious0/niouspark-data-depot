"In this rapidly changing world, seeking a part-time job is stated to be crucial for university students. While I agree that this can strengthen their curriculum vitae in terms of skills and work experience, I believe that other extracurricular activities can give them the same benefits.

On one hand, a part-time job is considered to be the preparation for a full-time occupation. This is because when working in a professional environment, students would have opportunities to get hands-on experience in their expertise as well as improve their soft skills if their part-time jobs are related to their major. As a result, such work experience would impress employers when students apply for an internship in their senior years. However, a part-time job is only advantageous if it is relevant to the student's major, otherwise it only partially relieves their financial burden. 

On the other hand, there are other extracurricular activities that may be equally advantageous. For example, if students take part in a club, they can expand their networking which would give them a chance to meet professionals in their expertise. This would not only give them opportunities to have a mentor that can aid them in their work path but also provide them with valuable insights.

In conclusion, while a part-time is important in terms of improving students' skills and experience, I suggest they should also take part in other extracurricular activities."
