"I strongly believe that taking on a part-time job while at college is a smart move for most students. First of all, a small paycheck helps cover rent, groceries or even that ever-climbing tuition bill. When money is tight at home, doing a few shifts eases the pressure on Mum and Dad and on the student.

Second, real work teaches stuff you never see in a lecture. Serving customers at the campus cafe, shelving books at the library or typing invoices in a small office shows how to talk to strangers, juggle deadlines and fix sudden glitches. Those everyday skills shine on a resume and matter far more than some employers will admit.

That said, students need to keep an eye on the clock. If too many shifts pile up grades can slip, sleep can vanish and that hard-earned paycheck suddenly buys stress. Picking a gig that bends around classes, not the other way around, is by far the best plan.

So yes, I stand by the idea that part-time work is a good thing, provided students guard their study time as carefully as their paystub."
