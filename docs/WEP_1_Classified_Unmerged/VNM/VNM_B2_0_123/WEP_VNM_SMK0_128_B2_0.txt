I completely agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking not only harms the health of the smoker but also affects the people nearby through secondhand smoke. In public places like restaurants, everyone should have the right to breathe clean air.

Many people, including children, the elderly, and those with health problems, go to restaurants to enjoy meals in a comfortable environment. If smoking is allowed, it can ruin their experience and even pose health risks. Secondhand smoke is known to cause serious health problems such as lung cancer, heart disease, and asthma, especially in non-smokers who are exposed to it regularly.

In addition, a smoke-free environment improves the overall atmosphere of a restaurant. The air smells fresher, the furniture stays cleaner, and the place becomes more welcoming to all types of customers. Many studies show that banning smoking in restaurants does not harm business; in fact, it can attract more customers who prefer healthy and clean surroundings.

Some people argue that smokers have the right to smoke, but personal freedom should not come at the cost of othersâ€™ health. Smokers can smoke in designated areas outside, where it does not affect non-smokers.

In conclusion, banning smoking in all restaurants is necessary to protect public health and create a better dining environment for everyone.
