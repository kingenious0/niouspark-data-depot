In my opinion, I  partly disagree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Firstly, it is very hard to ban smoking at all the restaurants because smoking  is individual freedom. Besides that, in Viet Nam, banning smoking will decrease the number of customers because numerous  people get used to smoking. It leads to decrease the revenue and profit for the restaurants. On the other hand, banning smoking will affect  negatively the customer experiences because it breaks the joy of people. Many people use smoking to relieve stress after working hard . Therefore, the restaurants should have a smoking area to serve people who want to smoke. However in many luxurious restaurants, smoking should be banned because it negatively affects to the restaurant's atmosphere. This smoke will stay on person clothes and break luxurious atmosphere. For example, when people enjoy fine dining at the luxurious restaurants, people will spray their perfurme on their clothes to enjoy the ambience. Therefore, the smoke will leave on their clothes and make people feel annoyed. To sum up, banning smoking should not apply for all the restaurants due to individual freedom and decrease revenue. The restaurants should create a smoking area to serve who wants to smoke.
