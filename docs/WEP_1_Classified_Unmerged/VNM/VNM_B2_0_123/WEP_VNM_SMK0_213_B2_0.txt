In my opinion, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Firstly, restaurants are closed-room, which affects the mood of the other people who do not smoke but have to endure the smoke while eating and enjoying the food. Secondly, smoking in close distance affects the non-smoker’s health who are “indirect smoking” as well, especially with women and children. Thirdly, if needed to smoke, the customer can smoke outside the restaurant instead of inside. There should be no reason for the need to smoke or smoke constantly in the eating time like lunch or dinner, especially in public places like restaurants. Also, as the smoke affects the non-smoker in the restaurants, if smoking is allowed, the restaurants will somehow lose a certain number of customers who dislike the smell of smoke or worry about its downturn effect, which affects the revenue and the restaurant’s brand name. On the contrary, allowing smoking does not acquire any benefit for the restaurant. Last but not least, smoking is not hygiene in an eating place like restaurants and should not be encouraged. In conclusion, as smoking only benefits the smoker's relaxation, which can be done in other places like home but not public places with many people who come to eat and enjoy meeting each other like restaurants, it should be banned completely for the health of all the customers and also the restaurant business.
