"It is often argued that allowing smoking in restaurants infringes upon the health and comfort of non‐smokers. I strongly agree that smoking should be prohibited in all eateries nationwide.

First, making restaurants entirely smoke-free protects both patrons and staff. Secondhand smoke carries numerous toxins that can cause lung and heart disease. No one is forced to inhale these harmful substances. Therefore, employees who spend long hours inside avoid chronic health issues, which means fewer sick days and lower medical costs.

Secondly, creating smoke‐free venues can encourage smokers to rethink their habits.  When people must step outside to smoke, they become more conscious of how frequently they light up. Research indicates that such inconvenience can motivate individuals to cut down or even quit, yielding long‐term public health benefits. Thus, this policy not only protects non‐smokers but also serves as a subtle deterrent against tobacco dependence.

In addition, making venues entirely smoke-free can lead smokers to reassess their habits. When they have to go outside for a cigarette, they become more aware of how often they light up. Studies show that this small inconvenience can prompt people to cut back or even quit, delivering lasting public health benefits. In this way, the ban not only protects non-smokers but also quietly discourages tobacco dependence.

In conclusion, implementing a nationwide ban on smoking in restaurants is essential. It preserves the health of the public and workers, enhances the dining experience, and supports smokers in reducing their tobacco consumption. Although smokers may feel inconvenienced, the advantages to society as a whole far outweigh any minor discomfort."
