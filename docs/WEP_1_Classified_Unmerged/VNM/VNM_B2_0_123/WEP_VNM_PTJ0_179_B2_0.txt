I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Firstly, it can be relevant to students’ financial status. Some students don’t have enough money to live in expensive urban life, so they must do many jobs to exist. Secondly, doing part-time jobs not only solves financial problems but also provides students with many practical skills such as communication skills, critical thinking, and team-work skills. This knowledge can be the luggage for students on future careers because these are all important criteria that employers need. However, students can abuse part-time jobs and from there they will be distracted from studying in university. That makes part-time work during college become the reason why students forget their main purpose. Finally, students should be careful in choosing a job that suits them and complies with the law. If not, they may do illegal work to get large amounts of money. It’s also a danger to social order and security. In conclusion, working part-time jobs by students can provide a large of human source for job markets but it can be a place that creates many lawbreakers due to lack of finances and immature thinking. Students need to be more careful and mature.
