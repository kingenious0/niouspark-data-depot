"As societal progress is undergoing, many people think that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country and I totally agree with that point of view regarding human health in the long term.

Firstly, smoking is an addicted product that should not be used for any reason, because it not only affects people surrounding them but also affects themselves. Especially in public places, where there are many children and the older, who have sensitive health, the government should be banned it at all costs. For instance, in restaurants, food can be harmed by their smoke and affect the customer's physical health such as stomach and headache.

Importantly, when the authority does not allow them to use cigarettes, users will accept their rules and establish a habit of forgetting smoking. However, banning smoking in restaurants is still not enough, government should public more strict law, especially in parks, playing area of children, and school. This can enhance the citizens' well-being and improve the air quality in the public places, for instance, if there are no one use cigarettes, children are more ready to play outdoors with friends and explore new things.

In summary, I strongly agree with the law of banning smoking in restaurants both in terms of well-being and the convenience of consumers, while the government can take more actions to deal with this problem."
