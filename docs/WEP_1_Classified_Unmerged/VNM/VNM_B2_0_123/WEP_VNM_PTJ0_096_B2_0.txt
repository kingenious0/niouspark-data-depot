"Opinions are divided on whether college students should acquire a part-time job. Some argue that this creates opportunities for students to be financially independent and gain experience, while others think that this can distract time from their studies. However, I firmly believe that having a part-time job is essential for college students.

Admittedly, working part-time can be challenging. For instance, students have to balance between working and maintaining good performance at school. With the heavy workload of tertiary education, it can be overstimulating to most students, leading to negative impacts on physical and mental health. In some cases, students drop out of universities because they value their work more. This can be harmful to the futures of students if they don't receive proper guidance and advice.

However, I think that the benefits can outweigh the disadvantages. Firstly, working part-time can help students gain valuable experiences, as they are shaped into working under stress and building knowledge off the field they are working. There are a vast variety of positions that they can choose as a part-timer and this can later on give them more insights about work life that schools do not teach. Moreover, being under constant productivity can also be beneficial. Although a large body of students experience stress from trying battling between constant working and studying, over time they can overcome their struggles and build their endurance. Both of the aforementioned benefits can give them a headstart compared to others, making them a powerful competitor in job-finding after graduation.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that taking on part-time employment is a worthwhile endeavor for college students. By learning to navigate workplace demands and developing essential skills, students can prepare for their future careers and become more competitive in the job market.
