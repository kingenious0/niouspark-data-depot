"Part-time jobs have been in increasingly high demand among both college students and employers alike. This may be because more and more people are finding extracurricular jobs crucial in career and personal development. Amidst opposing opinions on this issue, this essay will argue that it is not necessary for university students to spend time working besides their studies.
There are several possible reasons for a student to not have a part-time position. Firstly, some vocations require a high, if not sole, focus on curricular training for students to get jobs after graduation such as medical doctor, nurse, priest or nun. Some of these vocations including medical doctor and accountants even place emphasis on the grades of specific academic courses and certificates for students to secure a place in the job market. Secondly, doing a part-time job may pose certain threats to academic performance of students such as lowered mental health and distractions from studies. These consequences may therefore have a negative influence on the pursuit of a university degree, thus leading to waste of time of effort.
Meanwhile, some people may argue that a part-time job can help students with tuition fee and living expenses during university time. In fact, some students are able to pay their college costs while doing a side job outside their school. However, this cannot be the case for every student since each person has different life purpose, career aspiration, and resources. For example, a middle-class student with adequate finance for tuition fee while coming from a socially disadvantaged area might not have the need for doing a part-time job.
In conclusion, while part-time jobs can be beneficial for some, they are not a competitive edge for every student. It is recommended that this issue be under careful consideration in career development services."
