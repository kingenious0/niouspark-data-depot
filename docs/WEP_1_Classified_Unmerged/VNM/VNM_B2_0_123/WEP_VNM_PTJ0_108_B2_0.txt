"In my opinion, students do not necessarily have a part-time job. The following essay sheds light to the reasons for this statement.

Initially, a part-time job may affect their study at college. Not many people can multitask, which also means they hardly do well both their schoolwork and their part-time job. This can lead to a consequence where they feel so guilty and depressed for not having high scores at school that they start to neglect their part-time job, or vice versa. Moreover, joining the workforce too soon may leave a bad impact on them, because not all working environments are healthy enough for college students to participate in.

On the other hand, the benefits of a part-time job to college students are undeniable. They could make an income to support their family's financial situation. They could also gain more experience, knowledge and skills while working. Additionally, part-time jobs provide them the potential for after-college employment so that they will know sooner where they aim their life to.

In conclusion, college students should be encouraged to get a part-time job if they have a need to develop themselves or to earn some extra money. However, there is no issue if they want to concentrate on their study first."
