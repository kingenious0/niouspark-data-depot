"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. There are strong reasons to support this idea, especially for the health and comfort of other people.

First of all, smoking in restaurants can affect other customers, including children and elderly people. Even if someone is not smoking directly, they can still breathe in the smoke, which is very harmful. Many studies show that secondhand smoke can cause serious health problems like lung cancer or heart disease. Therefore, banning smoking in restaurants can protect public health.

Second, the smell of smoke can make other customers uncomfortable. When people go to restaurants, they want to enjoy their food in a clean and pleasant environment. The smell of cigarette smoke can ruin the taste of food and the overall experience. Non-smokers especially may choose not to return to a restaurant if smoking is allowed.

However, some people may argue that smokers should have the freedom to smoke. I believe they can still do so outside the restaurant or in special smoking areas that do not affect others.

In conclusion, banning smoking in all restaurants is a good decision. It protects peopleâ€™s health and creates a more comfortable space for everyone. Restaurants should be places for relaxing and enjoying food, not for breathing harmful smoke."
