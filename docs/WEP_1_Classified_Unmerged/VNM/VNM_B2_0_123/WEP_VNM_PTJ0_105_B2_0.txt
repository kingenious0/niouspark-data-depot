"Nowadays, some think that college students should have a part-time job to make ends meet. I totally agree with this viewpoint, and I believe that it is important and beneficial for them to have an income.

In terms of doing for living, college students can do many part-time jobs such as teaching tutor, waiter, selling handmade products. It not only helps them to accumulate experiences but also enhance their living standards. For example, a freshman tries to sell a mechandise, they can gain more knowledge about how to negotiate with clients, deal prices with vendors, and learn how to manage and distribute their budgets when needed.

Moreover, through doing part-time jobs, university students can have money for paying their school fees and living cost, which is a big problem when they live in an energetic city.  Therefore, they will not be depressed, worried by not having enough money, in the long run, this can enhance their emotional health. Importantly, doing part-time jobs will save them a lot of money, so when college students in an emergency they still have savings to face their problems.

In conclusion, having a part-time job is very essential for college students that can affect the way they live and their personal perspective in many aspects.
