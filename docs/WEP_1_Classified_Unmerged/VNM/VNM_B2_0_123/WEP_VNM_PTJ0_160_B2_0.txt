From my perspective, I partly agree with this statement. Firstly, getting a job when being a college students is like a trial version of applying for a job when you graduate. You will know how to prepare your CV, how to write cover letter and how to express what you want and show your ability towards recruiters. Secondly, having a job helps students gain more experiences in social communication and broaden their relationship circle. Thirdly, you can be more independent and understand the value of money. When you start to work to make money, you are more responsible to your spending and maybe if you are lucky enough to find a good job that help you make a lot of money, you don’t have to ask family for financial support at all. But on another side, if you have strong financial support and want to follow academic career, you don’t have to get a job, instead, utilize that time to broaden your circle and find opportunity from them. Some students may work so hard that they can’t concentrate on classes at school and worsen their study performance. In this case, i don’t think it’s a good idea for them to get a job.
