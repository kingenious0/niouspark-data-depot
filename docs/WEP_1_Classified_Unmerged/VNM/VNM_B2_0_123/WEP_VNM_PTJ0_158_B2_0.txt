"Nowadays, having a part-time job while still learning in university is no more unfamiliar to young people. Some people suppose that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. In my perspective, I disagree with this statement for some reasons.
First, having a part-time job or not will depend on the purpose of each student. Some would like to experience some working skills or knowledge that could be useful in their future, therefore, they choose to work and study simultaneously. In contrast, some students aim to focus on studying at school and try their best to have good scores in every subjects. Second, the decision to have a part-time job will also depend on the ability of time management. Students usually need to consider whether they can balance the time for doing their homework and the time spent on doing part-time job. Third, from my best knowledge, even when students pass the internship application, they still need to be trained for several months, then having a part-time job is not really important because we still learn and learn when we receive an offer from enterprises.
In conclusion, I suppose that having a part-time job might be important to some students, but not all. As we have different aims and abilities.
