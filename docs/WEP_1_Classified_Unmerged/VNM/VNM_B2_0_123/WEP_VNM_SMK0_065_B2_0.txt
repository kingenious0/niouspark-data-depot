"Many people state that governments should completely ban smoking at all restaurants across the nation because it affects people who do not smoke. I completely agree with this statement and the following essay will give details of my reasons.

First of all, imposing a ban on smoking can protect public health. Given the reasons that secondhand smoke is harmful, especially in enclosed spaces like restaurants. This means that non-smokers, including children, older people, and staff, should not be exposed to it. Otherwise, it will give them chronic health issues related to their heart or lungs.

Secondly, banning smoking would give comfort to everyone in the restaurant. This is because the smell of smoke can leave on the customer's clothes, which would negatively affect their experience, especially families and health-conscious individuals. As a consequence, such experience may lead to bad reviews on the places, damaging the business. 

Last but not least, in restaurants, especially those with materials that easily catch fire, like tablecloths or alcohol, smoking can increase fire risks. Thus, banning smoking can improve the safety of restaurants overall.

In conclusion, I wholeheartedly agree that every restaurant should be smoke-free, and authorities should impose a ban in the nation for a better customer experience."
