"Yes, yes, and YES. I absolutely think that college students should get a part-time job. There are plenty of reasons as to why college students should have a part-time job, regardless if they are well-off or need to make ends meet. First of all, a part-time job gives students an opportunity to earn some money on the side while they invest their time onto their studies or hobbies. For example, if you have lectures at Monday, Wednesday and Friday evening, you will have plenty of time to spare on the rest of weekdays, which could be used on other activities or getting a part-time job that you can work and earn money. Secondly, part-time jobs allow students to expand their social circles and facilitate networking by working with different managers, fellow colleagues, and people from all walks of life, opening up new opportunities or experiences to learn. Next, part-time jobs open up a wide variety of difficulties, ranging from job hunting to dealing with potentially obnoxious customers, helping students to mentally prepare for future jobs. Last and most importantly, part-time jobs allow students to accumulate work experiences, giving them a leverage in future job-hunts where students can use their work experiences like work ethics and achievements to prove to employers that they’re a reliable employee.
College students who come from far away counties will consider part-time jobs a must-have if they want to pay rent, food, utilities and tuition fees, while living in major cities, and well-off students might need not to worry much if their parents had already paid for their tuition fees and giving them allowances, but it is still important that college students get a part-time jobs, for all of the reason above, and because staying at home all day long can get boring fast."
