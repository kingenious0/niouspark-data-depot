"I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. This rule protects public health and improves the dining experience.

First of all, second-hand smoke is very harmful. Non-smokers, including children and elderly people, may suffer from breathing problems, allergies, or other health issues when exposed to smoke. Restaurants are public places where people come to eat and relax, so everyone should feel safe and comfortable. Second, banning smoking helps keep the environment clean. Smoke leaves a bad smell on furniture and clothes. It also creates ash and cigarette butts that staff have to clean. A smoke-free restaurant is fresher, more pleasant, and more attractive to customers.

Some people may think that smoking is a personal choice. However, personal choices should not affect the health of others. Smokers can smoke in areas outside the restaurant without disturbing anyone. In addition, many countries around the world have already banned smoking in restaurants, and it has shown positive results. More people enjoy going out to eat, and the number of smoking-related health problems has gone down.

In conclusion, banning smoking in restaurants is a good policy. It protects non-smokers, keeps the environment clean, and makes restaurants more enjoyable for everyone."
