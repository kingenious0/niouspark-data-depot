"I strongly disagree with the idea that smoking is completely prohibited at all restaurant in one nation. The main reasons will be outlined in the following paragraph. 

Everything has two sides, and smoking is no exception. While smoking is proved to have more disadvantages for people's health than benefits, entirely ban it from restaurants seems to be inappropriate since it was still a customer experience. Smoking can be anyone's favorite experience or a way for them to relieve their stress. Restaurants provide foods and customer experiences, so prohibiting one of them can clearly affect their service outputs. In reality, not all restaurants cater to the same type of customers. Some restaurants or bars are specifically designed for adults and they already have separate smoking areas or outdoor spaces. A nationwide ban would have strong effect to both restaurant owners and customers, as it remove the freedom of owners to decide how they operate their business and customers to choose a place that fits their preferences. Instead of a strict ban, a more balanced solution can be promoted such as requiring restaurants to have clearly marked smoking and non-smoking areas, or proper ventilation systems. This allows both smokers and non-smokers to coexist without significantly affecting each other's experiences.

Overall, although smoking does have negative impacts on health, completely banning it in all restaurants across a country could be seen as an extreme measure. A more flexible approach would better suitable for the rights and preferences of all individuals involved. "
