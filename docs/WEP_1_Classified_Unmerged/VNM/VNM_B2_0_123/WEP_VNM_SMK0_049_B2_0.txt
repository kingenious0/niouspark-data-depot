"There are some opinions that smoking should be restricted in all restaurants in the country. From my perspective, I partially agree with this idea because of the following reasons.
Undoubtedly, smoking restrictions in all restaurants can bring long-term benefits. It is noticeable that smoking is not only detrimental to the smoker, but it also does harm to the surrounding people. Restaurants are public places where a number of people breathe the same air, and the spread of smoke in such places will certainly cause annoyance and health problems. Therefore, the disappearance of toxic smoke may protect the well-being of customers at the restaurant, improving the mood of people eating out. Moreover, a smoking ban in this area can contribute to a clean atmosphere, enhancing the beauty of the restaurant.
However, a ban on smoking can cause negative impacts on the profit of the restaurants or tobacco industry. If all restaurants restricted the appearance of cigarettes, the number of customers who are smokers will decrease. The reduction in customers may result in profit losses, leading to financial difficulty in the long run. On the contrary, in case customers limits their use of cigarette to follow the rule, this will represent a threat to the tobacco industry. With the number of consumers declining, tobacco manufacturers may struggle to market and sell their products, which can lead to bankruptcy of the whole industry in the future.
All in all, smoking restrictions in restaurants have both benefits and limitations. It is important that smoking should be banned, but not in a strict way. This can bring advantages for both customers and restaurant owners."
