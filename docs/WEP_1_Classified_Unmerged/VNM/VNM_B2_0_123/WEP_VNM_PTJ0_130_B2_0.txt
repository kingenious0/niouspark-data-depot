"I think college student should have a part-time job. It is good for them in many way. First, part-time job help them earn money. Many student donâ€™t have enogh money for daily life, like food, rent, or books. When they work, they can help themself and not need ask parents all the time.
Also, part-time job can help student learn new skill. For example, they can learn how to talk with customer, how to work in group, or how to be on time. These thing are very useful in future. Student can become more responssible when they have job. Some job also help student with their study. If someone study English, they can work as tutor or in language center. If they study IT, maybe they work in computer shop. This give them good experience before they finish school. But also, working too much is not good. If student work many hours, they feel tired and no time for study. So they must find balance between school and job.
In conclution, I agree that college student should do part-time job. It help them with money, skill, and experience. But they must be careful with time and not let it hurt their study."
