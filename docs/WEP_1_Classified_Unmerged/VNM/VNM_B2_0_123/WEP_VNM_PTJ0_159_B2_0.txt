"I agree with this statement for some reasons. Firstly,  having a part- time job helps students earn extra money, which helps students reduce financial pressure. I am now a part-time tutor for primary school student, which helps me cover things like food, transportation, some personal needs and reduce the financial burden on my family. 
Additionally, working while studying gives students valuable life experience, improves their time management skills, and prepares them for the future job market. In my case, tutoring has helped me improve my communication skills, learn to be more patient, and manage my time better so that my studies don’t suffer. These are real-life skills that I know will be useful no matter what job I do in the future. Most employers appreciate students who have work experience because it shows responsibility,  and an understanding of how the working world operates—even if it’s just a small job. 
In conclusion, I believe that having a part-time job during college is a smart choice. It helps you grow as a person, become more responsible, and prepare for the future"
