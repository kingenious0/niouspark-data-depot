"It has always been controversial whether college students should have a part-time job besides their study. I will discuss the pros and cons and give my own perspective below. 

On the one hand. When students graduate from high school and go to college, it changes not only from their living expenses but also the environment. There has a rise from the college tuition due to the facilities and teaching methods. 

Furthermore, college students have to live on their own,  they have to balance their living expenses such as: transportation fees, learning material fees. In some cases, it is normal for students with a good financial background but if they're not, they have to get part-time jobs to support them when they receive short budgets from their parents. Having part-time jobs when they are studying college will give them the opportunity to gain new experiences.

On the other hand, college students should focus on their study in the college program due to the fact that the college program is complex and more difficult when compared to the high school educational program. It requires them to have lots of time for self-learning and researching. Secondly, getting part-time jobs when they study may get them overloaded and burned out. In addition, it is such a waste of time when they work in a different field which is irrelevant to their major in school. 

From my perspective, I believe that college students should dedicate most of their time to studying in school and later on, they can get a part-time job or internship related to their career. It allows them to turn knowledge into practice and opens up their circle of relationships in their jobs. "
