"Nowadays, there are many arguments between the advantages and disadvantages of part-time jobs. I agree that there are many risks for students if they spend half of the day working instead of studying. However, in my opinion, I strongly agree with that part-time jobs are still important for college students. 

Firstly, part-time jobs are opportunities for students to understand deeply the real experiences after the college path. They went to school because they wanted to get useful knowledge and skills for working. It would lead to the phenomenon that many students care about learning only. Therefore, they don't have social skills such as communication, negotiation, finding job, etc.

Secondly, I believe that students can earn a little money for their college path. Many students have a difficult condition, so it's pretty good to share the burden of the tuition fee with their families.

Lastly, a part-time job environment is a good place to make more quality relationships. These days, many companies don't want to pay a large amount of money for hiring; instead, they can ask their employees whether they know someone who is suitable for that position. If students know correctly how to make friends with older people, they will have chances to be introduced by those ones. 

In conclusion, it's important for college students to have part-time jobs because if you choose carefully, you will receive more benefits than you can think. "
