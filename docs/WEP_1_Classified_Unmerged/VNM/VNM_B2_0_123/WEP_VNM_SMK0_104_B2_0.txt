"Many argue that smoking should be banned entirely in restaurants across the country. While I acknowledge that smoking can be harmful to both smokers and non-smokers, I believe that a complete ban is unnecessary.

On the one hand, prohibiting smoking would significantly improving public health. Non-smokers, including children and those with respiratory conditions, should not be exposed to secondhand smoke, which has been proven to cause serious health issues such as lung diseases and heart problems. Additionally, banning smoking would create a more pleasant dining environment as cigarette smoke can be offensive for many customers. This policy may also encourage to reduce their tobacco consumption, leading to long-term health benefits for society.

However, I believe that a total ban on smoking in restaurants is too extreme. Instead of completely prohibiting it, restaurants can establish separate smoking areas to accommodate both smokers and non-smokers. This approach ensures that customers who wish to smoke can do so without disturbing others. Furthermore, modern ventilation systems can be installed to minimize the impact of smoke in enclosed spaces. Many countries, such as Japan, have successfully implemented this system, allowing restaurants to cater to all customers while ensuring public safety. Furthermore, banning smoking entirely could negatively affect businesses as some customers may choose to dine elsewhere where smoking is allowed.

In conclusion, while restricting smoking in restaurants is important for public health, I believe that an absolute ban is not the best solution. Instead, creating designated smoking areas with proper ventilation can help protect non-smokers while respect the rights of smokers, which balance public health concerns with individual rights. Restaurant owners and policymakers should work together to find an approach that ensures a comfortable dining experience for all customers."
