"In these day and age, it is argued that having a part-time job is cruel for university students. In my opinion, although it brings lots of benefits to them, i agree with this point of view for several reasons.
On the one hand,  student should focus on their study instead of having a part-time job. Having a part-time job can suffer their academic perfomances. Since they spend most of their free time on working, they do not have time for studying. As a result, their grades could be affected.
On the other hand, it is undeniable that college learners should have a part-time job. Firstly, it helps them to improve their soft skills which are not taught in school. For example, when a college student is a waiter, they can improve their interpersonal skill and learn a lot of soft skills which can be helpful for them when they do a full-time job after graduating. Secondly, they can have a bonus earning that can help them cover some daily expenses such as food and transportation. Without it, college students may have financial difficulties since the allowance that their parents give them every month can just adapt their basis expenses. 
In conclusion, i believe that college students should have a part-time job. However, they should balance their schedule so that it does not affect their study."
