"Most people think that college students should do a part-time job. In my opinion, working part time will offer them many advantages. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.
First of all, a part-time job can bring many social experiences for students. Eighteen years old when students start college is a landmark of full growth. They need to prepare practical knowledge for a future job. So a part-time job is exactly what they need. For instance, my younger brother used to be quiet and clumsy. When he was a first-year university student, he worked at a small bookstore. Since then, my brother had better communication skills and became more calm. This part-time job has played an important role in gaining his social skills. It is a special factor in a college student's life. 
Secondly, they can have more money to improve their life’s qualifications from that job. A part time job helps them not only get more income but also have enough time to study. Moreover, they can not depend on their parents. For example, I can cover almost all my tuition without my parents' help since I started my first part time job as a tutor. My parents had to work hard for their three children's study expenses. So my job salary helps decrease my family’s financial burden. This also maintains the advantage of working part time for university students.
In conclusion, a part time job not only offers them social experiences like communication skills but also the independence of financial affordability. What they get from that job can make them more successful in the future. "
