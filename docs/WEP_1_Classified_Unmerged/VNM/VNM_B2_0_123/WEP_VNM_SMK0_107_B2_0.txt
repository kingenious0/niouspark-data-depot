"Nowadays, it is supposed that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. In my opinion, I totally agree with the above statement for some following reasons.

First, it is necessary to give a ban on smoking at public places such as restaurants in the country due to the community's health. Nicotine in cigarettes' ingredients is extremely harmful to both active and passive smokers' respiratory systems. Even worse, some people are detected to suffer from cancer after a long time of smoking and smelling the smoking fumes. When cigarettes are smoked in restaurants, there is a large amount of poisonous smoking fumes that have a bad effect on people who accidentally stay close to the smokers. 

Additionally, there are a lot of children, pregnant women and the elderly in public places like restaurants. These are the types of sensitive groups that suffer from toxic smoking fumes the most. 

Besides, it is also not suitable to allow smoking in the restaurant due to its' hygiene problem. Some smokers will throw their cigarettes in the wrong places, making the space of the restaurant become dirty.  The fumes or dust which are sometimes difficult to observe can be on the dish served to customers. 

In conclusion, I completely agree that smoking should not be allowed at all the restaurants in the country for some disadvantages such as bad effects on community's health and hygiene problems."
