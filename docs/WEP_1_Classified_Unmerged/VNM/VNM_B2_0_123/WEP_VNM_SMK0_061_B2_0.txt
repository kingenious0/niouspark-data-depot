"As cigarettes started being sold around the world for decades, smoking have slowly become the habit of many people. We see people smoke in many places, in the park, at their homeâ€¦ or the restaurants. But the problem is, smoking in a closed space like restaurants is regarded by many as impolite and harmful for everybody in the restaurant, especially children, so some have suggested banning smoking at restaurants completely. I agree with this statement. 

Obviously, smoking does bring pleasure to the smokers, in some cases, it can be used as a treat for mentally ill patients but under the watch of doctors. However, the disadvantages of it are numerous. 

Firstly, cigarettes contain nicotine, a chemical that can corrupt some functions of the brain, although many people are aware of this, they still continue smoking because nicotine can make a person addicted to it. 
Moreover, the smoke that is released every time they use cigarettes can lead to lungs cancer for anyone inhaling that smoke, so what is unethical here is that even a person does not smoke, they still get diseases because of other people. 

Additionally, the smell of the smoke is not even pleasant at all, which means it can create such an uncomfortable atmosphere for guests at the restaurants. Combine all of the above, smoking should be banned at the restaurants, for the health of the smokers as well as others guests. 

Despite the advantages of smoking itself that are stated in this essay, the bad side of it shows how good it is to ban smoking at all restaurants in the country. "
