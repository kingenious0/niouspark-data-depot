"Nowadays, many people suppose that college students should get part- time jobs so as to gain experience and money to cover a part of their living expenses. Meanwhile, others think that it is better for students to focus on their studies so that they can get stable jobs in the future. In my own opinion, I think it depends on the alignment of the part-time job and their current studying majors.
           On the one hand, if these part-time jobs have some similarities with students' studying major, then this will be a good way for students to sharpen their skills and experience before landing stable jobs. These part-time jobs will help them increase social interaction, expand their networking, and working experience which will give them more opportunities in the future. Furthermore, in the current hyper-competitive market, these jobs can be put in their curriculum vitae making employers be more impressive, compared to other candidates.  
          On the other hand, if these part-time jobs are completely different from their studying majors or passion then they are not beneficial to college students. As these part-time jobs can not help them sharpen any working skills, experience and academic jobs. As a result, they can suffer from many difficulties in finding well-paid jobs in their fields. Therefore, I believe students should focus on their study, enhance their knowledge and get jobs relating to their majors.
           To sum up, I believe that having part time jobs is beneficial for students as long as they have some similarities to their current studying majors. Therefore, these jobs can help students by allowing them to enhance their major knowledge, experience  as well as sharpen their working skills. "
