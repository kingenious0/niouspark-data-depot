"I totally agree that students in college should have a part-time job. It provides students with financial support and teaches them valuable skills that will be of great benefit to their future employers when they finally join the social workforce.

First of all, part-time employment aids students in managing their finances. College expenses cover tuition, textbooks, and necessities. Through part-time employment, students can support their families and learn how to manage their finances. In my case, while I was working as an English teacher in college, I could afford my monthly rent and have some left for emergencies. Such financial independence promotes confidence in students and makes them more responsible.

Furthermore, part-time work provides students with experience and skills. Working on actual tasks in actual settings allows students to learn time management, teamwork, and communication. That is to say, these are things students cannot easily acquire in a classroom setting. A student who works in a shop, for instance, learns how to handle an unpleasant customer, which prepares them for future work difficulties.

In short, part-time jobs are greatly beneficial to students in universities. They enable students to earn their own money and acquire valuable skills for the future. While it is arguable that it is difficult to balance work and study, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages."
