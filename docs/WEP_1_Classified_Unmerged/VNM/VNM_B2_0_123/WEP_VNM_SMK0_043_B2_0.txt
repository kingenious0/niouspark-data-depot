"Some individuals think that using the cigarette in the restaurant ought to be completed restricted in the nations. Personally, I wholeheartedly agree with this statement and I will explain the reason this following essay.
Smoking in the public place such as the restaurant might make a badly impact on people’s experience and the operation of the restaurant. First, it can effect on the restaurant quality and the customers in the restaurant. For example, the smoke from the cigarette may affect other customer’s taste on food and some of them cannot be satisfy with their experience in the restaurant and rate low quality for the restaurant. Secondly, smoking in the restaurant cause some unintentional trouble for the restaurant. For instance, if someone smoke in the restaurant, the dust from the unfinished cigarette can lead to the fire and damage the facilities of the restaurant. 
To limit the consequences, in the macro, the authorities need to have some strict regulation in completely banning smoking in the restaurant, especially public spaces. The government can run the campaign about the worst effects that smoking can make in the public places to raise the awareness in society. In the micro, the restaurant operator and staff can have their own smoking area, where allow the smoker to finish their cigarette and not to disturb other customers. Furthermore, they can watch and remind if the any of them have an intention to smoke to limit the smoking action in the restaurant.
To sum up, smoking in the restaurant can lead a handful of consequences for not only the customer but also the reputation of the restaurant. That the reason why the authority  and the restaurant director need to take action smoking need to be have a stringent ban the restaurant in the near future."
