"              One of the causes of lung cancer now is caused by smoking so the ban on smoking in public places as restaurants is essential. While some argue that smoking is on individual freedom, I strongly believe that prohibiting smoking in restaurants is indispensable because smoking can bring public health concerns and fire hazards.

              Firstly, it is scientifically proven to be very dangerous and non-smokers are unwittingly suffering the serious consequences caused by those who smoke freely. Especially in environments such as restaurants, there are many diners affected when smoking is not prohibited. For example, many studies have shown that people exposed to secondhand smoke can have a higher risk of lung cancer.

              Another reason why smoking in restaurants should be banned is fire hazard. It can be said that restaurants are extremely flammable places, so if someone smokes and throws cigarette butts around in the restaurant area, it can cause a fire that affects many innocent people. Therefore, families with children who are concerned about fire safety will avoid restaurants that do not have smoking regulations.

              In short, banning smoking in restaurants is very necessary and should be implemented in all restaurants today, not only because of public health concerns but also because of the danger of fire, and smoking needs to be clearly regulated to avoid affecting unrelated people."
