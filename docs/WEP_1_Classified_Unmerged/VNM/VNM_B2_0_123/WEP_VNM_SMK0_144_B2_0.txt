"In my opinion, smoking should be totaly banned in all the restaurants in the country. There are many reasons for this, and I believe it will make everyone better if this happen.
First of all, smoking is very bad for health. Not only the person who smokes but also the people around them are effected. When people eat in restaurants, they want to enjoy the food, not to breath in dirty smoke. I think it is not fair for nonsmokers to suffer.
Secondly, smoking makes the place smell bad. The smell of cigarette can stay in the air, on the chair, and even on the food. That is very gross, and I don’t want to eat food that smell like smoke. Many people will agree with me about this.
Some people said that smokers have right too, and we should allow them to smoke in some parts of the restaurant. But I think that is not good idea because the smoke still goes every where. It is very hard to control that. So it is better to just ban it all together.
In conclusion, I strongly agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants. It is for the good of everyone’s health and comfort. If we do that, restaurants will be more clean and friendly to everyone"
