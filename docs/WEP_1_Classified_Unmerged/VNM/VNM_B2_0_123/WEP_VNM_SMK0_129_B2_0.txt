"I totally agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants. Smoking is bad for health, not only for smokers but also for people around them. When someone smokes in a restaurant, the smoke spreads in the air and makes others feel uncomfortable or even sick. Many people go to restaurants to relax and enjoy food, so the environment should be clean and healthy.

Futhermore, smoking makes the air smell bad and the place look dirty. The smoke can stay in the air, on the walls, and even on the furniture. It is not good for children or old people who may have health problems. A smoke-free restaurant is a better place for everyone.

Some people say restaurants can have smoking areas, but I don’t think it works. Smoke can still go to other areas, especially in places with air conditioners. So the only way to solve this problem is to ban smoking completely inside restaurants.

In conclusion, I believe smoking should be completely banned in restaurants. This way, people can enjoy their meals in a clean and safe space, and it helps protect everyone’s health, not just the smokers themselves."
