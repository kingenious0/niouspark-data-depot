"Some college students are wondering if they should have a part-time job or not. In my opinion, the answer varies from individual to individual.

On the one hand, doing part-time jobs can help them compensate their families. They can also utilize their salary to satisfy their demands for delicious food and nice clothes. For example, an average college student gets five million VND for one month. They have to use that amount of money to pay rent, pay for public transportation and food. They hardly purchase new clothes or cosmetics with that humble amount of money, especially for those who live in big cities. Therefore, doing a part-time job can help them satisfy themselves. Moreover, it is advisable to gain experience from doing something relating to their majors.

On the other hand, doing part-time can lead to bad results at school. If they spend too much time and effort on a part-time job, this can result in lack of sleep hours which make them less concentrate on lessons. Additionally, nowadays many universities support poor students with scholarships that help them pay more attention to studying.

In conclusion, doing part-time during university has both pros and cons. Therefore, it depends on college students' circumstances to decide whether or not to have part-time jobs.
