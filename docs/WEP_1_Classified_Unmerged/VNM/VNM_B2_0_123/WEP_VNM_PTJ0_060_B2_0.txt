"Having a part-time job has been a crucial aim for university students recently and is growing more than ever before. In my opinion, I both agree and disagree with this trend at the same time because of the experience it brings and the time we need for the jobs.

The reason why people who are still in colleges need to try new jobs is due to the knowledge and experience they gain through the jobs. Firstly, students are likely to solely learn through lectures and exams at school, which might lead to the lack of real life experience that their majors actually need. In that case, finding a part-time job that matches the student's major could bring a lot of benefits since they can try and learn in the environment of real-life scheme. For instance, it could be seen that overseas students usually find part-time internships to gain more experience and help them with monetary problems.

On the other hand, college students can still suffer from insufficient time for their daily work. If the jobs demand a lot of time to do and finish all the deadlines then maybe the students don't have time gaps to do their homework and focus on their studies. Therefore, their scores at school could be low or they couldn't pass their tests at school. Moreover, sometimes the students choose part-time jobs that are not related to their majors, which may lead to it just a waste of time since the experience cannot be used for future purposes.

In conclusion, I do agree that students should have part-time jobs while studying but they have to pick the right one that help them with their further careers.
