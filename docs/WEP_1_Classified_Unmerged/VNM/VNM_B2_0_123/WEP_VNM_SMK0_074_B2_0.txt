"There has been concern whether smoking should be banned from every restaurant in the country. In my opinion, smoking must not be used in restaurants not only because of the detrimental consequences caused to humans, but smoking also create uncomfort to others. This essay will discuss two reasons that smoking must be banned at all restaurants.

To begin with, smoking cigarettes or pods can bring numerous harmful repercussions to humans and the people surrounding them. However, while the public has the awareness of smoking's negative consequences, they still do not realize that it also causes illness to the people surrounding them. Therefore, there must be a policy which limits the use of cigarettes and pods in the public areas. This is not only controlling smoking in public, but it also prevents people from having detrimental consequences caused by smoking.

Another reason is that smoking can create uncomfort to people who do not smoke. More specifically, the smell of cigarettes may cause the people who are not familiar with this breath harder. However, this is not the reason for the smoking people to change from using traditional cigarettes to pods. Because the company has developed pods with many flavors, such as strawberry, blueberry, etc. This is also really uncomfortable because these fragrances are just artificial. Hence, whether cigarettes or pods, they also cause the same feelings and impression,

To sum up, smoking must be limited to being used in public, such as in restaurants. Therefore, I strongly agree that it is necessary to ban it from the public areas. "
