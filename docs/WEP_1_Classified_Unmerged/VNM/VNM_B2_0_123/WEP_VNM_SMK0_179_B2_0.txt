I definitely agree with this rule. Firstly, cigarettes have a huge impact on the health of smokers. It’s the reason for respiratory diseases such as tuberculosis, lung cancer, and asthma. Smoking is also a difficult addiction to quit and provides a large number of stress-reducing substances to the body, which greatly affects the smokers’ nervous system. Secondly, smoking not only affects the smoker but also affects those whose directly smell the smoke. If they breathe in smoke for a long time, they will also suffer from similar respiratory diseases. Smoke is especially dangerous for pregnant women because it can threaten the life of the baby. The restaurant is a public place so the number of people coming will be very large, so there are also lots of smokers and many indirect smokers. Foods in restaurants that smell of cigarettes lose their delicious taste and impacts the quality of the restaurant’s service. In conclusion, I think the law banning smoking in restaurants is the right thing to do. Furthermore, it can improve the cuisine as well as the quality of the restaurant. The most important opinion is protection of the customers’ physical health when they come to restaurants and the community in society.
