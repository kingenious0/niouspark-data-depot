"In today times, being a college student can be difficult as a college student may find themselves having to battle with both educational and financial hardships. For the latter reason, many people believe that it is mandatory for college students to be having a part-time job. In my opinion, I strongly agree with this statement for various reason.

Firstly, living in a big city is extremely costly and for a college student the easiest way to earn legal money is through a part-time job. Having a part-time job will enable a student to save up a little bit money to support their education and personal life. A part-time job provides a student with a sufficient amount of money so they can tend to their personal needs. Furthermore, with the money they get from working, the financial strain on the student’s family at home would be lessen.

Secondly, when a student takes part in a job, they get a chance to embark on an actual working experience. It helps build their self-confident and personal experience, both of which would become a major advantage in their future career path. In addition, as they are taking part in the job, they will have a chance to expand their social network. Thus, giving them a better chance for their future works.

In conclusion, I strongly agree with the statement that a part-time job is crucial to a college student, and I believe that having a part-time job would benefit them greatly both in their personal life and future career."
