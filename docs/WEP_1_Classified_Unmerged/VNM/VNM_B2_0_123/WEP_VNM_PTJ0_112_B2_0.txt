"In these days and age, many teenagers are seeking for part-time jobs and considering them as an important thing in their life. From my point of view, it is essential for university students to have a part-time job due to several reasons.  

First of all, college students are able to earn money by themselves. It is clear to see that students can reduce their family financial burden and have an ability to pay for whatever they want instead of borrowing their parents' money. Take Meichan, a famous Vietnamese KOL, as a good example. She made a living by creating a TikTok and YouTube channel about learning, beauty and fashion while she was studying at Yonsei University. By the money that she owned from that part-time job, she could pay for her life in Korea.

Secondly, having a part-time job can make students to be more and more independent,  they will have a chance to know how to spend and saving money effectively. For example, when we buy something that is not by our money, we usually buy some stuffs that sometimes we do not need to use. But if we buy by ours, we will consider things more and more carefully before buying them because we tend to feel regret after spending money. 

To sum up, I totally agree that having a part-time job is vital for many university students."
