"Many believes that smoking is a bad habit as it brings discomfort to both the smokers and those around them, and so it is argued that smoking should be prohibited from every restaurant across the country. Personally, I agree with this statement for I believe that it would do more good than bad. 
The primary reason for my opinion is that smoking causes a great deal of annoyance to everyone close to the smoker for it is a public space they are smoking in and not everyone is comfortable with smoking, especially the children and women. Moreover, when dinning at a restaurant, one would certainly encounter a variety of different kinds of people, some struggles with diseases that when exposed with secondhand smoking, would do them great harm.
In addition, the ones who smoke tend to suffer from chronical illnesses caused by the harmful chemicals in the tobacco. For example, smoking is the number one cause for lung cancer. These illnesses are usually dangerous and extremely difficult to cure.
In conclusion, because of the effects smoking can have on a human person, I strongly agree that the prohibition of smoking should be made wide across every restaurant in the country. And in doing so, will help built a safer environment for the public spaces."
