""It is advisable that all the restaurants in the country impose a ban on smoking" some people believe. From my varying perspectives, I am in agreement with this statement due to its various advantages to overall well-being of customers and people in the restaurants.
 
By applying this smoking ban on a large scale, many restaurants can promote their business image in terms of clean and healthy space for all customers. This is because the smell of smoking tobacco or cigarettes is uncomfortable and by the way it also does harm to the health of many surrounding people in the restaurants, so banning smoking can assure all customers about a clean and ideal place for them to eat or drink here. As a result, in the long run the restaurants can attract more target customers to come and experience wonderful services in their own restaurants.
 
It is undeniable that the prohibition of irresponsible smoking in all the restaurants will minimize the risk of catching or causing fire in these ones. It is reported that there are many fireâ€“related accidents due to littering used cigarettes or tobaccos irresponsibly in many restaurants, so if the law of banning smoking comes into effect, there will be no occurrences of these accidents in the restaurants. In the long term, customers will feel safe and secure when they choose restaurants to hold a party or just celebrate some memorable occasions.
 
In conclusion, I fully agree with the suggestion that smoking should be prohibited at all the restaurants in the country due to its undeniable outstanding plus points mentioned above.
