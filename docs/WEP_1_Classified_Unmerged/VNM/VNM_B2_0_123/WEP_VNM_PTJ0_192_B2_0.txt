"Job plays an important role in college students life. Some people agree that it is important for college students while the others say it is unnecessary. Personally, I believe that it is vital for college students to have a part-time job for some reasons.
Firstly, part-time job allows student to apply their knowledge in to practical working situation. In the university, students are not easily given a chance to solve with real-life cases, they only learn theorical knowledge and it tend to difficult to memorize for them. For example, my majoring is Auditing, I only being taught about boring theory such as professional ethics, I even don't know how to use Excel until I joined as an accounting intern at a local company last year, where I have improved my skills, especially in accounting knowledge.
Secondly, part-time job can help students pay for their expenses. Most of college students in my country are often work to pay for their living. Although the income is not too high, but it is suitable for their demands. In adverse, college students who not work are usually lack of money, leads to a fact that they tend to stuck with their bills monthly.
To sum up, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job."
