"Some people say that college students should have a part-time job, while others argue that they need to focus on their studying. I personally think that the first statement is outweighed. 
On one hand, college students main objectives when going to college are studying, getting good grades and getting a scholarship if possible. Having a part-time job would indeed affect to their performance at classes if they don’t know how to allocate their time appropriately. Moreover, going to college or university has already taken most of their time and create a lot of stress such as peer pressure, financial issues if they have to retake some tests,… Therefore, if they spend their time on working part-time, it would drain them even more due to stress at work.
On the other hand, it’s still necessary to have a part-time job outside school as they could learn a lot from their jobs if they are somewhat related to their major so they can apply what they learn in their works. Even if they aren’t, the students still can gain a lot of experiences from what they are responsible for and strengthen their soft skills such as communicating, multi-tasking, organizing,… This could be an advantage when they write their CVs to impress the employers as well as being able to learn on job faster and get used to the working environment. Furthermore, they can have another source of income to be able to pay bills and what they need without relying on their families too much.
In short, I find that college students should work part-time if they can organize their schedules so as to gaining knowledge and  having practical experiences for their long-term objectives."
