"It is well-known that smoking is devastating to one’s health, despite that fact, it is still so common that cigarette is one of the most sold items all over the world.
Smoke from cigarette irritates me personally, and I believe many others. It could also affect people around who inhale it negatively, fragile people like pregnant women or small children to be more specific. Smoking in public places should not be acceptable, especially restaurants, since in other places, there are various ways people can avoid the smoke for example wearing masks, or staying away, but it would be impossible to do it inside a restaurant, where people come to eat! So, I, to some degree, agree with the statement that all restaurants in the country should ban smoking completely.     
While some people might strongly disagree with this rule, since for them, smoking is a way to show their personalities and release their stress. I have seen many people struggling to abandon that bad habit, so if this rule is made, it would be hard for families and friends in their gatherings because if one wants to smoke, they need to get out of the restaurant. So instead of banning, it would be more favorable if restaurants could divide their spaces into different areas, with one designated place that allow smoking.  "
