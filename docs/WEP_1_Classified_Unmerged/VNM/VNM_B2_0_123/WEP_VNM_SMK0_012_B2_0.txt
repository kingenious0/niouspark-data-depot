"I agree that smoking should be completely prohibited from all restaurants in the country. There are plenty of reasons as to why I agree with banning smoking. First, smoking is itself, harmful enough to the smoker, but when you smoke in indoor public spaces like restaurants, other will smoke in the cigarette/tobacco’s smoke as well, indirectly affecting other people’s well-being, if not worse than the smoker themselves. Second, it is distracting, people cannot particularly focus on their meals if they are surrounded by the smoke of cigarette, can they? It also does not help that the cigarette’s smoke makes the food taste badly thanks to cigarette smoke ruining the meal. Third, it is considered rude when you smoke inside restaurants, people will consider you as inconsiderate when you do so with little regard to other’s health, like the two reasons above.
Nowadays, It is rare to see smokers inside restaurants, less so than brick-and-mortar diners, all thanks to strict regulation and social stigma, which helps restaurants seeing less smokers and people stay healthy. While I agree that smokers should be banned from all restaurants in the country, they should also be provided a special space to do so without affecting others. Many places and workplaces have special spaces like a smoking room, with ventilation and ashtrays provided, perhaps restaurants could implement the same thing if smokers are to be allowed.
