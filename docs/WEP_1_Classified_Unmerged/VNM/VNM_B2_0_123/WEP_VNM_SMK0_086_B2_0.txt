"Etiquette, as important as it is, is sometimes not many people's concern especially when going out in public. Eventually, some people tend to smoke in public spaces like restaurants without the consent of others. Therefore, banning smoking in diners is a must to maintain a healthier environment.

On the one hand, smoking is bad, not only in restaurants but in general, as it affects your health in a negative way. For instance, the smoke from cigarettes will lead to tremendous diseases which include cancer and many more. However, this is not only the case, smokers use cigarettes not only harm themselves but also the others. For example, a research once showed that people who sniff the smoke indirectly have a higher chance of catching those deadly diseases than the ones who smoke. 

On the other hand, a place meant for eating being filled up with cigarettes smoke is not really sanitized. Just imagine not only restaurants, but also public spaces that are filled with harmful smoke, the air will be polluted tremendously. If we don't ban smoking in diners now, soon the whole country will suffer severe air pollution. 
However, although completely ban smoking at every restaurant is necessary, we should also raise people's awareness. Actions like making "stop smoking" posters or not letting people smoke near the others, especially kids are really important.

To conclude, for a healthier and greener environment for everyone, smoking should be prohibited at all restaurants in the country."
