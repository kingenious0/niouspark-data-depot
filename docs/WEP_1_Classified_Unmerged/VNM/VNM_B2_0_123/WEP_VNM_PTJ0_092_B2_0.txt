"In recent years, there is an opinion are trending on social media that It is important for college students to have a part-time job. I think I slightly disagree with this view. 

For me, having a part-time job should be optional because the most important responsibility of college students is studying. If they focus on part-time jobs, they may ignore tasks at university. They haven't much time to complete homework, presentation and read books, so their marks could be low. The workload of universities is too much and complex so that it is required for students to spend more time gaining knowledge, prepare soft and hard skills, and conduct some science research to make their portfolio better than others. 

On the other hand, I think college students should spend time applying to university clubs about their major. It is essential if they have specific experience because market labor is seen a fast change day to day. Sometimes the part-time jobs can help them expand the monthly budget without their major experience. Joining the club can bring them more major knowledge. When they graduate, they may take more time to find jobs to get experience. The student that gets part-time job also may not be as appreciated as the student getting specific experience by joining clubs associated with their major. 

These are my view about the topic "It is important for college students to have a part-time job." I disagree with this opinion because I think students should spend more time studying at school, gain major knowledge by joining university clubs."
