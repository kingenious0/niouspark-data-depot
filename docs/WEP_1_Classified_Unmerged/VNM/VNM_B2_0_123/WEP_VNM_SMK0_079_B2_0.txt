"Nowadays, humans have always needed to face many stresses and psychological problems. With the development of technology, science has created a lot of things to help people get rid of those problems. And with that, smoking was born, as first, with the knowledge of humans in old times, they simply think it will help people relax with some of the chemical substances that smoke contains. But time proves that smoking really harms not only humans but also the environment. With that reason, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.

Firstly, restaurants are a place where people have their meals, to have a good experience while customers are eating a meal, restaurants need to ensure that their meal has a good taste and smell. But unfortunately, smoking negatively affects the smell part, it can change the way a meal smells, and make a customer unsatisfied with their experience. This way, it can also decrease the restaurants rate and income.

Secondly, smoking harms the health of all the people surrounding it. And restaurant customers can maybe have health problems that can be more dangerous if they unfortunately breathe a smoke. Restaurants will need to have the responsibility for customer health, even though it is not their fault at all.

In conclusion, it is necessary to restaurant to completely ban smoking in their place to protect their reputation and also customer experience and health.
