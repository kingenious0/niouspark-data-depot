"These days, smoking in public places is still a big issue in many countries. Some people think that smoking should be totally banned in all restaurants. I completely agree with this idea for a few important reasons.
To begin with, smoking in restaurants affects other people who don’t smoke. When someone lights a cigarette, the smoke spreads around and everyone breathes it in, even if they didn’t choose to. This can cause health problems like coughing or even serious diseases. I think it’s unfair that non-smokers have to suffer just because someone wants to smoke.
Moreover, restaurants are places where people come to enjoy their food and relax. If there’s smoke in the air, the food doesn’t taste good and the atmosphere becomes uncomfortable. Some people even leave the restaurant early or never come back. That’s not good for business. Owners may lose customers just because they allow smoking in their place.
However, I understand that smokers might feel the ban is too strict. They want to enjoy their meals too. But they can always go outside or to special smoking areas. That is more fair for everyone. Restaurant should care about the health of most customers.
In addition, second-hand smoke are just as dangerous as direct smoking. People with kids or elderly family members might avoid going to restaurants completely if smoking is allowed. 
In conclusion, I believe smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. It protect people’s health and creates a better dining experience for everyone."
