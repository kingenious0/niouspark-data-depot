"It is clear that students in universities should join some extra-time job. However I partly agree with this statement, in this essay I will manifest my point of view.
Part-time job will help student to be mature quickly. The first reason for this idea is that they will understand more clearly the value of money that their parents invest to them, that’s why they will know how to save their money and spend it on the valuable things such as education, sport or something is relevant to their improvement. Moreover they can also enhance the deep of their soul  that make them feel sympathize and thankful to people surround them. Secondly, extra-time job will grind their personality, soft skills or how to attitude with people in the society. It is the time they can experience variety of job, communicate with numerous people from different background. Therefore, they will be able to form a unique characteristic.
On the other hand, own a part-time job in university time also waste their time. Especially a medicine students or software engineer students, these students should spend time on studying theory and learn how to apply it in practical. In addition, money can make students quit school early, although they have not graduated. Since, when they are able to earn money, they will focus on their work maximize. Therefore, their grade at university will decline significantly.
Part-time job have advantages and disadvantages. However students should know how to balance their life."
