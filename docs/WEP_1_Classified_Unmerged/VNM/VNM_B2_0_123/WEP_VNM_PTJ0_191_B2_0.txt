There is an opinion that having a part-time job during university years is of paramount important for students, and I partly agree with this statement. On the one hand, doing a part-time job equips students with important soft skills, such as leadership, team work, communication, negotiation and critical thinking. These soft skills, or professional skills, are extremely essential in the workplace environment, regardless of geographic locations or specialities. This is because all people need these skills to deal with every situations both in their daily and professional lives, to get on well with others, and to make the right decision during their life. Therefore, having a part-time jobs beside studying may be a good choice. However, my stance for this is that the decision on whether to apply for a part time job for university undergraduates should depend on their specialities. In fact, some theories in many specialities like information technology (IT) are especially difficult, demanding undergraduates a great deal of their time and effort. If college students in these fields take a part time job, they may lack sufficient time and strength to follow their academic work in university. On worse cases, they may get bad marks and fall behind their friends. In the long run, this would lead to them being less competitive in their specialized job market. Having said that, I also acknowledged the fact that if undergraduates in these challenging majors can manage both part-time job and their academic development well, they will become applicants that almost all employers and headhunters desire.
