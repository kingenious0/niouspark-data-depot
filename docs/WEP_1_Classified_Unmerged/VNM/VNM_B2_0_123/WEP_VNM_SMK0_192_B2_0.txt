"Smoking issue is a popular topic to discuss about whether it should be banned or not, especially in the restaurants. In my opinion, I believe that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country for some reasons.
Firstly, it is unhealthy for the smokers. Smoking has been investigated that it is not good for people health. It is a fact that smoking too much is one of the causes leads to lung cancer. There are no research about smoking benefit, but about its disadvantages. My father's friend died last year due to smoking too much.
Secondly, it cause harmful for relevant people in the restaurants, especially kids and pregnant woman. The smoke also causes everybody uncomfortable due to its smell. Kids and woman who smells smoke can become cancer too. There are many doctors have been warning about this fact recently which makes the publics shocked. 
To sum up, I am hoping that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in my country because it has no benefits, and it also leads to many worser diseases. "
