"As a freshman at the University of Economics. As I take my first steps into university life, I have reflected on the question of whether having a part-time job is important for students. Personally, I partly agree. While part-time work brings many valuable benefits, it is not the only path for students to grow and succeed.

During my high school years, I actively engaged in various extracurricular activities. I was the Head of Fundraising for the charity project Giấc Mơ Cho Em, a member of the HR team in Trăng Tròn, and the organizer of the talk show “IELTS and Its Practice.” I also won second prize in a school debate competition and served as an ambassador for the English Speaking Club. Now, as a university student, I continue to explore opportunities through roles in events, mentoring programs, and marketing competitions.

From my experience, I believe part-time jobs can teach time management, responsibility, and financial independence. However, students can also gain these skills through volunteering, organizing events, joining clubs, and taking part in competitions. These experiences, like mine, build confidence and prepare us for the future.

In my opinion, part-time jobs are important, but they are not the only way to grow. As a freshman, I choose to focus on adapting to university life, exploring my interests, and building a strong foundation for the years ahead. Growth can come from many directions—not just from work.
