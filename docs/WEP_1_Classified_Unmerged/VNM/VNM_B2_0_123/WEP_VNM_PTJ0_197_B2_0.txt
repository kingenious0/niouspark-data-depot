"Part-time jobs play a vital role in college studentsâ€™ future career path. In my opinion, I agree with this statement.
Part-time jobs bring a variety of opportunities for students who have been looking for work experience. Most students put too much attention on academic study and forget to widen their understanding about the industry that they want to work in the future. That leads to the awkward circumstances of job disorientation and unemployment when they graduate and start to look for jobs which involve their college major. These students only have the knowledge that they absorb at the university and lack of practical skills such as leadership, time management, teamwork, communication and so on. It is extremely difficult for them to cope with the real working tasks and businesses generally do not have enough time to teach you all these skills because the employers want to hire the approved students who can transform their knowledge effectively and solve problems. They would train students who work as a staff rather than a student. So to improve and widen your knowledge to prepare for a job, students need to start with a part-time job which involves in the major that they are familiar with. 
To sum up, I think students need to look for a new job when they are still studying at the university due to curent economic regression."
