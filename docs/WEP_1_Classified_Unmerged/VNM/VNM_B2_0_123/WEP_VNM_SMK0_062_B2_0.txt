"It is believed that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. From my viewpoint, I strongly agree with that statement.

First, secondhand smokers can get serious health risks. Non-smokers, including children and pregnant women, are vulnerable to these harmful effects. For instance, a family visits a restaurant where smoking is allowed, children may inhale toxic substances, which increases their risk of developing asthma issues. A complete smoking ban in restaurants would protect customers from these dangers. 

Second, a smoke-free environment enhances the dining experience. The smell of smoke can be unpleasant, making it difficult for people to enjoy their meals. Eating a delicious dish while the strong smell of tobacco fills the air would lower the enjoyment of the meal. 

In addition, restaurants that ban smoking attract more customers, as many people prefer a clean environment when dining out. A smoking ban in all restaurants not only helps to lower the risk of getting cancer but also creates a fresh environment for customers when dining out.

In conclusion, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants because it endangers public health and disrupts the dining experience. A smoke-free environment benefits everyone, making restaurants more welcoming and enjoyable places for all customers."
