"Several arguments have arisen among people about the topic that every domestic restaurant must prohibit smoking. From my perspective, I strongly agree that smoking should not be allowed in all restaurants because of these following reasons. 
Firstly, smoking cigarettes in restaurants is harmful to not only the smoker but also the people around. Such public places as  restaurants have a large number of people with different health conditions, so toxic materials of smoke can easily cause them risk of lung diseases.In a restaurant serving a variety of customers of all ages,for example, they can passively inhale the smoke that worsen their health status, especially children and old people. 
Secondly, smoking in restaurants or other public areas can set a bad example of unhealthy behavior for their descendants . Obviously, one of the main reasons for the increase in the number of young people being addicted to smoking cigarettes or POD is that they constantly come across this action in family and crowded places like restaurants. For instance, if the adults do not smoke in restaurants or other locations , the younger generation will not be curious and imitate them. 
In conclusion, principles need to be implemented to totally ban smoking in restaurants due to this bad habit being the main cause of various diseases, deaths and fires. "
