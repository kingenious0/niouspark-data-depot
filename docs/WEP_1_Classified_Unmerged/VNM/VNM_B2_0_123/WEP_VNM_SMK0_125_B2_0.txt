The debate over smoking in restaurants is complex and involves various public health, business, and personal freedom considerations. From my perspective, I think the government should ban smoking in public because It can badly affect people, especially children. It is harmful to general health and upset many people.
     
      To begin with, Non-Smoking will decrease the money that man must pay for. They don't have to pay more fees for this consumption this month. They will have the rest of the budget to use in other ambitions. Banned smoking will create a better environment for the public so on.
     Furthermore, a smoking ban in restaurants can be seen as a societal commitment to promoting healthier lifestyles. It also offers a level playing field for all dining establishments, as no restaurant would be at a disadvantage in enforcing a smoke-free environment. This policy can also encourage smokers to reduce or quit smoking, which could lead to long-term health benefits for the population. 
      On the other hand, This will cause a deficit for the smoking industry sector and The government. This is bad input so I would not concern about this.
     In conclusion, it would be important to explore these arguments, examine the evidence from jurisdictions where smoking bans have been implemented, and consider the ethical implications of such a policy. The essay could also investigate the economic impact of smoking bans on restaurants, drawing on case studies and statistical data. Ultimately, the essay should provide a balanced view, acknowledging the complexities of individual rights and public health concerns, while making a persuasive case for the proposed ban based on the evidence available."
