"In the present, there are many addictive substances that seriously influence people's lives. One of the most significant representatives is cigarettes. Many people believed that people should be banned from smoking when entering any restaurants in the nation. 

One of the main reasons leading to this suggestion comes from the bad effect of cigarettes. Cigarettes not only make people addictive whenever they smoke but also destroy their organs day by day. According to many researchers, smoking is one of the main reasons behind the decrease of life expectancy in many countries. Another reason is that smoking wastes a big amount of money, which easily causes financial difficulties to societies. People pays a great amount of money for not only smoking but also dealing with the destruction that it brings to their bodies

On the other hand, there are still some benefits that smoking brings to humanity. One of the most significant advantages is relaxation people feel whenever they try it. Many people get stressed after work but they can not find any way to relax themselves so they decide to have some cigarettes. If they use it at an appropriate amount, it will not seriously affect their health. 

In my opinion, although there are some advantages that cigarettes can be used for, it's still very risky for societies to produce and purchase it legally. I believe that there are still many things that can replace the benefits of cigarettes so the government should consider it as an illegal product to protect societies from addictive substances.
