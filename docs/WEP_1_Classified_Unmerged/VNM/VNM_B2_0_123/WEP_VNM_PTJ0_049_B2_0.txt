"There are some debates about the importance of part-time jobs in the academic journey of university students. From my perspective, students should have a part-time job because it can bring several positive impacts.
The first benefit of having a part-time job is that it can provide useful experience. Unlike traditional classrooms where most students only study academic subjects, a part-time job can act as an environment that enables students to apply their knowledge. Instead of being a passive recipient of information, through part-time jobs, students can have a chance to practice what they know and learn valuable lessons from the results. Moreover, as being exposed to the workplace, students can also become more familiar with matters such as the importance of responsibilities or the work-life balance. 
Another advantage of having a part-time job is the chance to establish rewarding relationships. Working in a new environment means meeting new people, and students can have a chance to make new friends. Having good company can get students motivation and self-reflection, which lead to boosted academic productivity. Along with friends, students can also have contact with seniors. Not only can students gain knowledge from experienced individuals, but they can also be more advantageous when it comes to suggestion or promotion in the long run.
All in all, a part-time job would bring decent lessons that may never be taught in traditional school. It is important that students get more real-life exposure and become active participants on their academic journey."
