"I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurant in my country for many reasons.
First and foremost, smoking is harmful for users’ health. It causes many dieases related to lungs, heart, and others part of human’s body. It also cause addicted due to its ingredient, which means the person using cigarette cannot stop themselves using it.
Not just harm the smoker, cigarette also cause damage to people near by the smoker by the smoke. Their are numerous people get diaeses due to cigarette’s smoke even though they are not smoking. Therefore, smoking should be banned in public areas such as parks, restaurants, hospitals, schools.
Additionally, restaurants serves foods and beverages, and smoking can effect others’ experiences. The smell of smoke can annoy people in the restaurant include customers and  staff. Customers will have bad feeling, since they chose a restaurant to having good meals and great time with each others. Even though the food or drinking are great, they will upset because of others’ smoking. In terms of staff, restaurant is the workplace, if they have to smell cigaratte smoke in the whole working time, they will feel annoyed, and also damage to their health.
In short, I personally think that smoking should be completely banned in restaurant and every public areas in my country."
