From my point of view, smoking should be totally banned at all the food and beverages supply service in the country. Basicly, smoking is nothing but causing people to be sick and die slowly day by day. Firstly, restaurant is the place where people having meals, enjoy their food during the day and take care of their health, there is no way cigarettes smell should be there and affect their health and satisfaction of having food. Secondly, not all the restaurants have wide space and windows, smoking fumes can cause the other people around to be sick and can’t enjoy the meals completely. Thirdly, allowing smoking in restaurants might cause the business to deal with more problems like keeping the space clean and fresh, creating some other rooms for customers who want to smoke and having a special rules for them who smoke. Last but not least, restaurants that don’t allow smoking could contribute to the project against cigarettes. Therefore, it is completely suitable and reasonable to ban smoking in the restaurants. Not to protect the general space for customers, but also to reduce the workload of the food and beverages business.
