"Nowadays, more and more people are concerned more in their health and eager for a better living environment. Fresh and clean air are some of the basic standards for a good living environment in general, but by the act of smoking makes the air around people worse. Therefore, it is necessary to have smoking banned at restaurants nationally, as restaurants nowadays are widely claimed as a place for relaxing and enjoying life.
The first reason for this idea is that the smoke from tobacco, cigarettes and so on does harm not only to users' lungs but also to the people around. Many studies agree that the released smoke from these bad things contains lots of dangerous substances like nicotine, which can destroy people's lungs if they are in them for a long time. It is such an unfairness if the people who do not use drugs are damaged by the harmful smoke just because of the people around them use it.
The second point for this suggestion is that smoking is such a money-wasting action. There is no need to pay for a thing that not only does harm to yourself but also to your family just to satisfy your favor. Drugs, tobacco or cigarettes are not affordable objects, some people have to sell all their properties and assets to buy those things. That leads to numerous crimes and creates a bad society.
To sum up, smoking in public, especially in restaurants, where people come to eat should be banned worldwide to ensure public health and fresh air for people."
