"Nowadays, people are getting used more cigarettes in everywhere, especially the restaurants. Some people say that "Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country". It is a good idea and I totally agree with this opinion because of the harmless that it influences to people.

Firstly, smoking in the restaurant is an extremely issue because it may lead to explosions. The cigarettes cannot be used nearly the gasses, especially at the gas stations or restaurants. When it is near the gas, the gas will be exploded and hurting hundreds of people and also lead to the death. Therefore, smoking must be banned at all the restaurant because of the danger that it can hurt people.

Secondly, the smoke from cigarettes harmfully influences to the people around, specially the kids and woman. It hurts the body inside, not only the smoker but also the people who do not use the cigarettes. So that it is very impolite to use cigarettes at the restaurant because it can harm to anyone near the smoker.

In conclusion, I always agree with the idea of banning all smoker in the restaurant to help people would not be influenced by the smoke and get in safe."
