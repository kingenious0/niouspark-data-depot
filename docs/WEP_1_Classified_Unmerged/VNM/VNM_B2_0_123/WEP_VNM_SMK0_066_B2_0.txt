"Some people argue that every restaurant in the country should completely ban smoking. In my opinion, I fully agree with this statement. 

Smoking brings a lot of disadvantages for both the customers and the restaurants. Smoking in restaurants damages public health. If someone in a restaurant smokes, the atmosphere and the places surrounding them will be full of smoke from the cigarettes, which is extremely harmful to human lungs. Inhaling too much smoke can cause many adverse diseases, such as lung cancer and heart disease. Moreover, smoking also affects the other customers' experience of enjoying the meals. For instance, they cannot smell the nice smell from the dish or taste the dish well. Therefore, this also affects the reputation of the restaurants. 

However, if the restaurant bans smoking, they will lose parts of customers who smoke. These customers might not go to their restaurants because they think they cannot enjoy themselves fully. Additionally, some people also believe that smoking is their own right and that they have the freedom to smoke in public without discrimination. 

In a nutshell, I still think that it will lead to positive influences if smoking can be fully banned at all the restaurants, but people should also have their right to smoke. In my opinion, restaurants should build smoking boxes or places for people to enjoy.
