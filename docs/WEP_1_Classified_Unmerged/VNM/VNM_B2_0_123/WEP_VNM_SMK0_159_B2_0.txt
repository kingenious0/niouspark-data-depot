"I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants across the country. 
First of all, smoking is harmful to everyone, not just the person who’s smoking. There are many people—including kids, the elderly, and people with health conditions—who can be seriously affected just by sitting near someone who smokes. My uncle used to smoke a lot, even when we went out to eat and later he developed serious lung problems. It taken him a long time to recover. 
Secondly, smoking ruins the atmosphere. Imagine going to a nice restaurant, ordering your favorite dish, and then having the smell of smoke floating over from the next table. It completely kills the mood and the flavor of the food. Restaurants are about food, not fumes.
Also, restaurant staff shouldn’t have to work in smoky environments. They’re there for hours every day, and their health matters too. Banning smoking protects not just customers, but workers as well.
In conclusion, banning smoking in all restaurants is the right move. It protects people’s health, keeps the environment cleaner, and makes dining out more enjoyable for everyone."
