In my own view, I agree with the opinion. To be clear, for me, it is important, but not necessary or required for college students to have a part-time job. Having a part-time job is a plus for college students’ experience, especially when the job is related to their main major. Students will have the opportunity to  the basic knowledge gained in school in reality, and from that, students will acknowledge more about the job’s characteristics. Besides the hard skills, students can also have the chance to learn and use the soft skills like working and collaborating with groups of people, leadership, handling jobs in critical time, networking, monitoring and managing the time and money of the project, and so on, which benefits the students in their career in the long way. In addition, part-time jobs help students to be more financially stable and help sharing the burden of money with their family while studying and living in large cities. In conclusion, it depends on the student’s financial needs, also the student’s goals of building and gaining knowledge, skills and experience in those jobs. After all, the most important goal of students in college is to focus on study, achieve knowledge and required skills for a longer career in the future.
