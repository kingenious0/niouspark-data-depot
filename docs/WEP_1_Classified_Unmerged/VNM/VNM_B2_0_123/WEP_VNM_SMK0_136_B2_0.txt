"Scientists have long shown that cigarettes are harmful to the body and human health. This is because smoking is harmful not only to the smokers but also to the people around them. Therfore, I strongly agree that smoking should be prohibited in all restaurants. 

Firstly, smoking in public places like restaurants affects surrounding people. Many people, including children and the elderly, go to restaurants to enjoy their meals. If someone smokes near them, they will breathe in second-hand smoke, which is very dangerous for their health. It can cause breathing problems, allergies, and even serious diseases like cancer. 

Secondly, smoking creates an unpleasant environment. The smell of smoke can ruin the taste and enjoyment of food. Also, it makes the air dirty and uncomfortable for non-smokers. In a clean and healthy restaurant, customers will feel more relaxed and happy.

Some people may say that smokers also have the right to enjoy their meals. However, their right should not hurt the health of others. There are many other places where people can smoke without disturbing others. Restaurants should be smoke-free zones for the safety and comfort of all customers.

In conclusion, I believe smoking should not be allowed in any restaurant. Banning smoking in these places will help protect public health and make restaurants more comfortable for everyone."
