"Healthcare, including young generation or the elderly is one of the most important aspects all around the world. There are many different things can lead to bad health from food and environment. There are opinions that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants and I strongly agree with that thoughts because of lack of awareness and reduce the rate of bad health.

First of all, people's awareness may be always massive problems. At present, most restaurants or coffee shops have own space for people who want to smoke and do not affect to other people. However, there are still many people confidently smoke in restaurants which are filled by many people including young, old or even pregnant women. Furthermore, air conditioners are placed in most restaurants and it can easily delivery this bad air to other people. Besides that, the action of banning smoking may also reduce the rate of sickness relating to lung. The banning of smoking in the restaurants may lead to the inconvenience in someone's life, so they may think of giving up smoking. Moreover, people who do not smoke can also reduce the rate of having lung sickness by not breathing in unfresh air.

In conclusion, I strongly agree with ideas that smoking should be banned completely in the restaurants. Most people would be more healthy if this opinions could happen."
