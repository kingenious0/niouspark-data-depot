"It is argued that all restaurants in the nation had better completely ban smoking. In my opinion, i totally agree with this point of view due to several reasons
To begin with, smoking can have bad effect on not only this person but also others. When a person smoke in a restaurant, other customers can inhale all the smoke that this person release into the air. As a result, many individuals' lung can be damaged even though they do not smoke. 
Moreover, letting people smoking in restaurants can reduce the number of customers coming to the restaurant. The smoke can ruin the taste of some dishes and make some customers feel uncomfortable when they eat in these restaurants. Consequencely, less and less customers want to eat in these restaurants, which lead to the drop of revenue.
Last but not least, it can promote a healthy lifestyle to people. More and more places ban smoking and make people quit smoking, leading to a better health.
In short, banning smoking can be necessary to protect health, improve dinning experience and help customers feel comfortable when they eat in the restaurants.  "
