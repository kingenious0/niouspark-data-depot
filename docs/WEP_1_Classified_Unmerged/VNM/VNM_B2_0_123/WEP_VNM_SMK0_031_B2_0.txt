"In the industry of hospitality management as well as policymaking, people have had hot debates on the ban of smoking in restaurants. Some people believe that the ban is impossible while others have positive views on such matter. From my perspective in the context of Vietnam, tobacco usage should be completely inhibited at every restaurant.
There are two corroborating reasons for the ban of smoking in restaurants. One of them is the improved public health as a consequence of fewer spaces for smokers. In the context of banned restaurant-smoking, while people can still smoke at other places apart from restaurants, eating is a necessity for every person, thus requiring people to curb their smoking habit. This downward trend can then reduce both primary and secondary smoking which are the prominent reasons for respiratory issues.  Another supporting argument for banning smoking at dining locations is the enhancement of the tourism and hospitality industry. This is because less and less people are smoking in these days and age; therefore, the absence of smoking in restaurants can increase public ratings. Such betterment can generate positive competition in the food and beverage industry regarding user experience, people can have more motivations for the use of dining conveniences and hospitalities.
In conclusion, while smoking has been a prominent issue, the ban thereof can bring about great benefits for the public good regarding health and economy."
