"It is admitted that smoking is harmful to our health. Consequently, I believe that smoking should be prohibited at all the restaurants in the country to ensure the health of people in public places like these.

         Firstly, restaurants are public places for people to enjoy delicious food and drinks. It is also a place for family, friends or colleagues to have parties and have a good time together. If smoking is allowed in those places, it will seriously affect the health of some special people like children, pregnant women or just girls. They will have a bad impression about the restaurants which allow smoking, leading to the decreasing number of customers. 

          Secondly, the action of banning smoking in restaurants would enhance people's awareness about smoking. They may note that they should not smoke in public places to ensure the health of their family, friends or other people. This may contribute to the campaign which supports mitigating global smoking, leading to some changes in human's awareness and modern health. Moreover, the money spent on producing cigarettes could be decreased because of the decreasing need from people. Government may utilize this money for investing in other fields such as economy, healthcare, financeâ€¦. 

          In conclusion, I believe banning smoking in all restaurants is of importance due to the overall health of people around us. "
