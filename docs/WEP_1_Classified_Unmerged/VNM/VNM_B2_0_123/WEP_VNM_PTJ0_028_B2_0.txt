"Part-time job is always a hot topic to discuss in the college student community.  Some people believe that it is especially important for college students to find a part-time job. However, I slightly agree with this statement because in my opinion, it depends on the major and how they manage their free time. Firstly, it is so clear that a part-time job can help you make a living or buy something on your wish list. Growing in the 2000s, college students now find it is much easier to find a job with the help of the internet. On the other hand, if you are not good at time management, paying too much attention to doing or finding a job can lead to an F grade in the most important subject. Then you must pay a tuition fee which is much higher salary to pass the exam. Secondly, your major is also a factor affect to you should find a part-time job or not. Take medical students as an example, there are many subjects on the lecture, after class, they have to join in the clinical class in hospital and self-study class. Therefore, spending time on a job has become more difficult than ever.  
In conclusion, like other things, part-time jobs also have their bright and dark side. There is not a right answer for everyone, the decision is up to you."
