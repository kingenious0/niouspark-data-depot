"There is a statement whether students at university should have a part-time job or not. I partly agree with it and personally believe that it should be depend on the situation and students' demands, not a must.
On the one hand, if their family backgrounds is very poor, they can't even afford neither the tuition fee nor the base living money, then students should get a part-time job in order to support and share the hard-time with their parents. In another context, if the students' condition is good enough, however, they want to buy something they like, or pay for the course they want to learn, such as badminton or the piano course, then it is also reasonable for students to have a part-time job for extra incomes. Nowadays, it is accessible to plenty of part-time job, students tend to wort as Cashier at retail shops or salers, or tutors, etc.
On the other hand, focusing solely on studying at college is still important. It is undeniable that GPA at university plays an crucial role in the career path of students. GPA is a factor to be judged when applied to Master Programme or to the top big firm such as big 4  audit firm or big 3 MBB. Therefore, having a high GPA is very essential to students, however, not anyone can be capable of getting high score easily without spending sufficient time of studying. Then if the students don't have any burden of finance, and they are not excellent test takings, so concentrate solely on studying is a preference. In a near future, it may not have any difference, but in the long run in career path, it does matter.
In conclusion, there are both benefits and drawbacks of having a part-time job. Choosing to get a part-time job bases on the students' choices and conditions, it is a trade off."
