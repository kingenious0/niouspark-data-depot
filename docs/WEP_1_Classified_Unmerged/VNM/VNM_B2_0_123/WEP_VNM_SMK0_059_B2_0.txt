"I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. 

Firstly, restaurants are normally considered as a perfect destination for couples and families to spend time together. That is why they really don't want anything to interrupt the cozy and happy atmosphere. Smoking is thought to be one of the interruptions so it is green for the restaurants to ban smoking. In case someone smokes, it affects the customers and the owners. While the moment is messed up leading to some situations that the customers may leave with upset attitude, the owners may lose some customers, even the friendly ones, leading the loss of profit which damages the service standard
 
Secondly, it is not healthy for anyone to smoke in restaurants because the space normally designed is small. To make a cozy place, the designers will make the space look small so the customers can have close contacts. In a man smokes, the smoking barely has ways to get out quickly, which is absorbed by everybody in the restaurant. As mentioned, families are the main customers. In the fact that some of them bring their children or even child with them, smoking not only its owner's lungs, but also family's and children's ones. 

In conclusion, smoking is not healthy and is bad for human healthy. Smoking in places which are small or don't have much space, it affects every body in the near area, especially restaurant where all kinds of human are there, including the future of the country.  "
