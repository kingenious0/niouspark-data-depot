"It is believed that smoking should be entirely forbidden in restaurants across the country. I completely agree with the statement. 

First and foremost, the act of smoking will greatly affect surrounding people at the restaurant. This is due to the fact that the smoke emitted can be harmful to many people, especially pregnant women and people with breathing problems. They can even be put in danger if they get exposed to the smoke for too long. If any unexpected situation like that happens, the managers and the staff at that restaurant will be at fault and will have to take care of the problem. Moreover, the smell of smoke can also annoy people who are trying to enjoy their meal, they might lose their appetite if the smell lingers around. As a result, they might find their experience at the restaurant bad and might not come back there again. 

Furthermore, smoking should be banned to set a boundary for smokers. This is because most smokers commit the action without noticing if they are disturbing other people, which can be really irritating. They do not care for other people's health as well as their well-being, causing other people to suffer from health problems. In most cases, smokers might not listen to the advice or reminders from surrounding people so it is important that there should be rules banning smoking for good. Such rules will ensure that people using a public service at the restaurants will not get disturbed by smoking and will also ensure that if someone violates the rule they will get a fine. 

In conclusion, I believe that there should be a rule banning the act of smoking at restaurants due to the sake of surrounding people. "
