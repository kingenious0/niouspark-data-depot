"I both agree and disagree with the statement as the essay shows my point of view.

On the one hand, some college students should have a part-time job because of several reasons. Firstly, there are some students who find university a good place for them to study, but they also find that the price for learning knowledge in that school is extremely high, higher than their cost of living before going to college. Therefore, they need to get a part-time job to get money to pay for their living and studying at colleges. Furthermore, through part-time jobs, students can get in contact with the real world, make relationships with co-workers, get some experience. Consequently, young people can get a good sight of seeing how society works and make themselves have more critical thinking about any problems that is happening in the world.

On the other hand, there are some reasons that college students should not have a part-time job. The most important thing for students when they get into a college is study. Therefore, they must study hard to reach good results and get a high-rate degree that makes employees impressed when employees need good students from the colleges. Or if they study hard, they not only get good marks, but they also get some support from their teachers who have good relationships in order to get a high-paid job easier. As a result, students should not take part-time jobs to get more time to study to get good results that determine their future life.

To conclude, there are some aspects that show why students should have part-time jobs or not. It depends on the reason whether they need the money or not while studying in colleges."
