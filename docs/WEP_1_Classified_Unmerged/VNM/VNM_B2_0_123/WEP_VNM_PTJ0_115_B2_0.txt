"Many people say that it is crucial for college students to take up part-time jobs besides their studying. From my point of view, I agree with this trend for the following reasons.

To begin with, some opponents might argue that having part-time jobs can negatively affect students in various aspects. This is because some kinds of work require employees to spend a substantial amount of time at stores, or even work overnight. If students take these jobs, not only will their physical and mental health deteriorate but also their academic performance will suffer. However, this line of reasoning is not sound becausse  there are other jobs, namely English tutors or online sales, allow students to flexibly adjust their schedules and balance their time between studying and working.

On the other hand, there are good reasons for students to start working. One of the most obvious perks is that they can save up money for their university expenses including tuition fee, house rent and etc, lessening their family's financial burden. Moreover, when taking part-time work, students can understand how hard it is to earn money, probably motivating them to work harder at schools. College students are also able accumulate valuable knowledge and experience when taking jobs, which will come in handy in their future pursuits. For example, an English teaching assistant can improve both their language and communication skills when teaching their students, helping them to gain proficiency in this language and hone their interpersonal abilities. 

In conclusion, despite some drawbacks, part-time jobs are still of great importance for university students thanks to their financial support, incentives to study and helpful working experience.
