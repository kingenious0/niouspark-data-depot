"I agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants. This is important for two main reasons: to protect people’s health and to create a more clean image for the restaurant.

First, smoking affects health badly. When someone smokes in a restaurant, the smoke goes into the air and other people have to breathe it in. This is called secondhand smoke, and it can hurt people who don’t even smoke. It can cause cough, headache, or even serious diseases. If we stop people from smoking in restaurants, everyone will be healthier.

Second, banning smoking helps build a more modern and polite image. Restaurants are public places where families, friends, and workers come to relax and enjoy food. If the air is full of smoke, it feels dirty and uncomfortable. A restaurant that is clean and smoke-free shows respect to customers and gives a better feeling. It also makes the restaurant look more professional and friendly.

In conclusion, smoking should not be allowed in restaurants. It helps protect our health and makes the place feel cleaner and more welcoming for everyone."
