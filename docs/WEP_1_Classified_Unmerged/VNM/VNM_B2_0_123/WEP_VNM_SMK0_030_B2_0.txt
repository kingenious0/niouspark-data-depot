"It is maintained that governments should prohibit smoking at restaurants across a particular country. Personally, I whole-heartedly agree with the statement due to several reasons.
Banning people smoking within the context of restaurants yields a number of important benefits to individuals. To commence, the policy can contribute to preventing smokers and others around from various health predicaments such as lungs cancer and brain damage, often caused by the immense toxicity of cigarettes. Gradually, the enactment of the prohibition can enhance the overall health of people forced to give up smoking in restaurants. Another critical advantage is tourism, as tourists, who usually gather at local restaurants in a host country, are less exposed to cigarette smoke. Therefore, the smoking prevention can reduce the risk of health issues for foreign visitors, indirectly associated with the promotion of tourism.
Furthermore, the regulation can also assure restaurant safety and environmental preservation. Regarding the former, as smoking in restaurants often increases the risk of conflagration, possibly causing injuries and casualties, due to burned cigarettes, the regulatory implementation can minimize the possibilities of this unwanted scenario. Environmental protection is another crucial benefit of prohibiting smoking in public areas, particularly restaurants. As smoking is usually common in such places, smokers often leave burned tobacco leaves and filtering part of used cigarettes, harmful to animal species and plants if these are released into the environment. As a result, the smoking ban can contribute to preserving the environment. 
In summary, I completely side with the opinion that smoking should be strictly banned at a national level since this can exert positive influence on people’s health, field of tourism, public safety and the environment."
