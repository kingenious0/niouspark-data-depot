"I strongly believe that college students should have a part-time job.

First of all, the most purpose for Vietnamese college students when they find a part-time job is to experience. Many young college students want to attend colleges or universities in big cities so that they can develop themselves better. Because of the different background and the youth of teenage, college students, especially who come from other smaller cities, have desire to experience life. To me, it is advantaged for them to get used to the hustle and bustle in the megacity. From that, they can change the old lifestyle fitting the new life that they are going to spend about 3-4 years on. While having a part-time job, they have chances to meet new people with different backgrounds and stories so that the college students can also learn a lot from them. In big cities, scams are a lot, learning from someone can help their life.  

As mentioned, the backgrounds of college are not alike, having a part-time job is a way for them to earn money. It is hard for the fact that countless students have to balance between the studying and the earning and it is a way for them to help their family. College life is not only students' dreams but also their parents' too, but not every family can afford that. To catch up the dreams, some college students must try their best to make money.

To sum up, having a part-time job brings lots of benefits. No matter the main of different people, a part-time job is a small step for the college students to step into the wide world. As you know, you have to finish the small steps so that you will have enough to come to the larger dreams.
