"Nowadays, people told that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. In my point of views I extremely agree with this opinion.
Mostly people think that smoking is the way to help them decreasing stressful, especially male. After a hard-working day, they have to smoke to feel more better. However, smoking causes lots of disease such as lung cancer, obesity, addicted,… It is the slowly way to make people die without painful. Besides smoking also affects to other people who breath the same smoking ash, specially pregnant and babies. Smoking ash can kill babies when they are not born and make the mothers’ health worse. 
In the restaurants, people pay to their experiences so they strongly need the best atmosphere. For example, people want to eat a dinner but the table next to them have a man is smoking. The smoking ash can make them feel exhausted. Therefore completely banned the smoking is the correct way. If some people want to smoke they can go outside. 
In conclusion, smoking is the bad way to feel more relaxed and it brings many problems to our health. At first, it looks nothing happen but in long time later, our health is can be worse and must pay lots of money for hospital.	"
