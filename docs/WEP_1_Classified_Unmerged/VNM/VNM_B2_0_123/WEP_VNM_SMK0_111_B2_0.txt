v"Nowadays, smoking is still a problem of a lot of countries. This essay will show the reasons why I agree to completely forbid smoking at all the restaurants in the country. 

Smoking brings a lot of problems to not only those who smoke a lot, but also people around them. To be more specific, a profusion of researches showing that average age of people smoking and people around them is lower than those who not, because when they smoking, a lot of pollutants which can be breathed are emitted to the air. Consequently, their lungs can be damaged in a long-term. They could catch cancer too! And restaurant is the place that a lot of people come to (include children), so if smoking is not banned, their health might be affected.

In addition, people come to restaurants to eat or have a good time there, maybe they need to relax, so it is awful to smell smoke fumes. Furthermore, if smoking is not banned at restaurants, many restaurants will lose a profusion of clients who do not like smoke's smell. Consequently, some restaurants might go bankrupt because of lack of money.

In conclusion, restaurant is not a reasonable place to people to smoke there, they can go another place to smoke. Therefore, I support the idea that "Smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country" thanks to the reasons I discuss above."
