"It can easily be seen that there are some problems emerging around smoking in the public places. I totally agree with the idea to completely ban smoking at all the restaurants.

Since we have found so many methods to improve our living experiences, smoking is something that we need to consider. We all know the fact that smoking is not a good habit to maintain, it causes lung cancer and many other respiratory problems. 

Moreover, it can even cause dissatisfaction for the surrounding people because of its smell. We have heard that it even has a really harmful impact on children and women, and restaurants are the places that they don't wear masks. People all have the freedom to do things as long as they are legal, but first of all, we have to care about the others' feelings and their health, especially in public areas. Restaurants are the places where people enjoy delicious meals, thus they don't want to be bothered by people lacking of community consciousness.

In addition, it is suggested that any restaurants should invest in building more smoking areas. It is an essential thing to do, staffs and managers also need to take measures for the problems where people usually complain about, not only the food but also the atmosphere they breathe. If the restaurants can tackle this problem well, they can get a better service and gain the appreciated feedback from their customers.

In conclusion, smoking in public places such as restaurants should be banned to protect people's health."
