"Nowadays, restaurants are the popular destinations for people to spend their time at weekend. It is believed that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. From my point of view, I completely agree with that statement because smoking is harmful for our health and even cause bad damage to other people around us.

Firstly, restaurants are the places that are crowded and people especially families come to it a lot. At weekend, the number of households choose restaurants as a place to have lunch and dinner are high so that is why smoking should be banned at that places. Women who are pregnant or children could face many terrible illness if they communicate with or have a seat near smokers.

Second, the policy that ban smoking at the restaurants could make a positive affect on our life. If they don't have the permission to smoke in the restaurants, they could minimize their time spending on smoking and sometimes give up that action gradually. For example, the number of people who smoke maybe partly reduced so that the quality of air could be improved considerably.

In conclusion, I believe that government should ban smoking at all the restaurants to reduce the number of people who smoke and protect others from illness caused by smoke."
