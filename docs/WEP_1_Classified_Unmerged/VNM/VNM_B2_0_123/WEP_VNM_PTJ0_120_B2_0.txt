On one hand, a thing that attracts my attention is personal success. To begin with, it is undeniable that dabbling in part-time jobs enables one to meet many people. The more contacts people establish, the more their social network is expanded. This makes it certain that they receive support from others. As a consequence, their tasks are bound to be accomplished at a smooth pace. Such unimpeded progress stands a great chance of bringing achievements to their creator. Also notable is how taking on a part time occupation facilitates competition. It is, undoubtedly, a great source of motivation for students to be pitted against their coworrkers. With powerful encouragement like so, it goes without saying that college students feel strong devotion to their work. Their efficiency are thereby massively increased. Therefore, the possibility of them accomplishing great deeds in all their pursuits is solidly set in stone. Truly, doing a part-time jobs primes college students for success.

On the other hand, an oft-quoted opposing idea is that doing many jobs entail unbearable risks. Therefore, it is guaranteed to make people experience personal collapse. However, it has little basis in reality. Switching between jobs are almost always attempted with prior carefully crafted plans. These ensure that all aspects of the venture are tightly controlled. With such attention, it is a given that risks never go beyond workable limits. Another often overlooked point is that even if large risks do exist, they push students into various different situations. This serves the purpose of widening their background, giving them the intellectual depth needed to assess their positives and negatives. As a result of this reflection, their self-improvement is considerably accelerated, and they are bound to achieve greater things. This means that changing from one job to another is of great assistance to succeeding in life. Truly, to believe that job switching carries insurmountable risks and is detrimental to success is an one-way ticket to an early grave.
