"Smoking in public places has always been a controversial topic in recent years. For the statement that smoking should not be allowed in all the restaurants in the country, I totally agree for some following reasons.
First and foremost, smoking is harmful. It is not only harmful to the one who smokes, but also to the ones who are around them. Especially, the health of children and pregnant people. Many research has found that, the smell of cigarette smoke can lead to dangerous disease like cancer. Moreover, the negative effects of smoking would be long-lasting, not only for the time we spent in the restaurant. With a high frequency of smelling the smoke, infants might also experience negative effects. Secondly, the smell of cigarette smoke will decrease the pleasure and willingness to taste dishes. This will be more severe for restaurants with air conditioning. Last but not least, most people smoke in public places are smoke in restaurants. If smoking can be completely banned in all restaurants, this would reduce the number of smokers. Therefore, the number of people who have dangerous diseases that related to lungs will also fall.
To conclude, smoking is extremely harmful to health. If it is banned in all restaurants, this would be a good solution to improve the health of the citizens.
