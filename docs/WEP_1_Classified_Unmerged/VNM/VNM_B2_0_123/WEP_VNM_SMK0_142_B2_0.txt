"I completely agree that smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants across the country. There are several important reasons to support this opinion.
Firstly, smoking in restaurants is harmful to the health of non-smokers. When people smoke indoors, especially in closed spaces like restaurants, the smoke spreads and affects everyone around. Secondhand smoke can cause serious health problems, including breathing difficulties, allergies, and even cancer. It is unfair for customers and workers to be exposed to these risks while simply enjoying a meal or doing their job.
Secondly, banning smoking helps create a cleaner and more pleasant dining environment. The smell of smoke often ruins the taste and smell of food, making the dining experience less enjoyable. Many people find the smoke unpleasant, and it can leave strong odors on clothes and hair. A smoke-free environment ensures that everyone can enjoy their time without discomfort.
In conclusion, smoking in restaurants should not be allowed because it harms others, creates an unpleasant atmosphere, and goes against global health trends. A complete ban is the right choice for a healthier and more enjoyable society."
