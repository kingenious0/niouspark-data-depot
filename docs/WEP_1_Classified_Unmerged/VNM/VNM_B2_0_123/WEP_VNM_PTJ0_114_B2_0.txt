"Nowadays, college students tend to find a part-time job to help their parents with school fees and develop their living standards. In my opinion, I completely agree with that statement and I believe that it could help students improve their life a lot.

On the one hand, jobs that aren't permanent could make student earn money so that they can pay for their daily costs without receiving it from their parents. It's noticed that university fee today is higher and most families feel quite hard for paying it, especially households that live in rural or remote area because living costs between countrysides and cities are different. Therefore, if student choose to have a part-time job, they could help their parents and enhance their living standards.

In addition, part-time jobs could bring some chances to develop students's skill such as communication skills, writing skills, so on. They have flexible time so that they could work in convenience stores, shops or in some restaurants that requires pratical skills. Other students choose to be a tour guide so that they can improve their English skills through talking with foreigners.

In conclusion, the fact that college students choose to have a part-time job is common and I think that's a good trend because they not only earn money to develop their life but also enhance their skills."
