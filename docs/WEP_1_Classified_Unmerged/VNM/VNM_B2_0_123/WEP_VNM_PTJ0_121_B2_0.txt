"Nowadays, many college students prioritize part-time jobs over their studies. They believe working can help them gaining more experience for their real job than sitting in class. I partly agree with this statement and I will share my view in this essay. 
First and foremost, today's companies require a wide range of skills from young people. Working part-time jobs can provide many benefits, including social skills, time management skills, and budget management. These are unique skills that they cannot acquire during their college education. According to recent research, people who worked part-time while in college are more likely to find permanent employment than those who did not work part-time. In addition, college students make their own money. Similarly, they can pay for their own rent, tuition, and living expenses. As a result, having part-time jobs must provide additional experience from society. 
On the other hand,  part-time job working can distract to their study. For starters, students should seek employment after graduating from college. In fact, working part-time jobs may deplete young people's physical energy. Admittedly, they may find it difficult to focus on their studies in college. For example, if they work in hospitality, they will become tired and experience mental stress. As a result, college students should focus on their ability to learn and prepare to find suitable jobs after graduating from universities.
 To sum up, despite the disadvantages of working part-time, I believe that students should work part-time jobs. This is because it can provide students with a wide range of valuable experiences and skills over an extended period of time."
