"Many people hold the opinion that working part-time is a crucial part of being a university student. From my perspective, I agree with the given idea, as working part-time can offer people working experiences, essential skills and resources that are valuable for them before stepping in the real job market.
To begin with, part time jobs offer valuable working experiences and essential work-related skills.  With part-time jobs, students are given chances to have a glimpse at their future fields and participating in the process of creating products and services. Even if these jobs are not related to their majors, they also offer environments for self-growth and developing other important skills, for example human relations skills and networking, which are beneficial for their future careers.
Secondly, working part-time is a practical way to earn resources and money for students to continue their studying. It is undeniable that further education are not affordable for many people, and without earning income many students would struggle to make ends meets with their living expenses. Therefore, not only can part time jobs offer valuable work experiences and skills, they also give students with financial burdens an opportunity to access higher education.
To conclude, I believe that having a part time job is crucial to college students, as it can benefit these individuals both career-wise and financially. Therefore, students should be encouraged to work part-time during their time in university, given the aforementioned advantages."
