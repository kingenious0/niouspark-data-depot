"I totally agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country as it is really harmful to human's health and customer's experience while using their meal.

Smoking causes problems for our respiratory system. It will make it hard for people to breathe when they are smoking or smelling the smoke for a long time. This will lead to the result that people don't have enough health to do some activities that they like such as playing sports. 

Besides, in the worst situation, they may have some illness related to their lung or lung cancer. That is the important problem that people have to pay attention to. Another reason is smoking will affect other customer's experiences. While people are eating their meal, they emerge themselves in good taste, suddenly they smell a strange smell, they will feel uncomfortable with their smell. Because of that, they won't come back to those restaurants and it will affect those restaurants. For example, people come to that restaurant because of the good smell and taste of its pizza. However, while they enjoy the smell of the pizza, the customer sitting at the next table is smoking, they are smelling the smoke instead and it leads them can't taste the meal because the smell also plays an important part in a joyful meal.

In conclusion, restaurants should ban smoking to be good for their business and customer's health.
