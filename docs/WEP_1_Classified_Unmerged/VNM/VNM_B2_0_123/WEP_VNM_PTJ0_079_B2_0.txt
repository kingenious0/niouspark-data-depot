"The topic about college students having a part-time job has always been a problem. Nowadays, as it includes both advantages and disadvantages. In my opinion, I agree that it is crucial for college students to have a part-time job, especially for freshmen. 

First of all, having a part-time job can give college students opportunities to improve their communication skills and soft skills. Before going to college, many students do not have the environment to level up their communication skills, their daily routine usually only contains repeated activities like sleeping, commuting, eating and studying. A part-time job can help students in that situation, it puts them into a situation where they need to communicate and have social interaction. After working and practicing in the part-time job, students will prepare for themselves a strong soft skill that can help them in the career ladder after graduation. 

Secondly, part-time jobs help students to upgrade their living conditions by giving them more money. With the income that a part-time job gives, students can invest in their hobbies, knowledge and a lot of things. Therefore, it also helps them in learning how to manage their money. 

In contrast, part-time jobs can sometimes harm college students in case they cannot manage their time between work and study. Many students can be too concentrated in working that they do not give attention to class and grade in university. But if college students can overcome it, they will be very strong in working environment."
