"I totally agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants across the country. Smoking in public places like restaurants is not only harmful to health but also makes other people feel uncomfortable.
First of all, secondhand smoke is very dangerous.  If someone is smoking near children and the elderly. This can lead to serious health problems like lung disease, heart issues, or even cancer. Since restaurants are places where many people gather, it’s important to protect everyone’s health.
Besides, cigarette smoke can ruin the customers' dining experience. Because the smell can be strong and unpleasant, and it can make the food taste worse. So a clean and smoke-free restaurant helps everyone enjoy their meals, and makes customers want to come back again.
Additionally, prohibiting smoking in restaurants can help create a healthier lifestyle. It shows that we care about public health and respect others. It may also help smokers quit or cut down on smoking.
In short, I believe banning smoking in all restaurants is the right thing to do. It protects people’s health, makes restaurants more enjoyable, and encourages a better way of living for everyone."
