"Whether smoking should be completely banned across all public restaurants in the country has been a topic of controversy. Some may argue that people should have the free will to do as they desire. However, I firmly agree that this practice should be banned due to many health-related issues.

Firstly, smoking can pose health risks to others, it is widely known that secondhand smoking can lead to health issues such as harming the lungs of non-smokers, causing breathing problems, and even the risk of cancer. The smoke emitted from smoking can affect restaurant visitors, even children can fall potential victims to these toxic fumes.

Secondly, smoking publicly especially in restaurants is often viewed as bad etiquette. Even without mentioning the related health issues, smoking produces an odor that is unpleasant to people around. In food and beverage places like restaurants where taste and smell are the most important criteria, this can affect the experience of others.

Lastly, banning smoking helps maintain cleanliness and hygiene in restaurants. Cigarette smoke leaves behind strong odors that linger on furniture, curtains, and carpets. Additionally, cigarette ashes and discarded cigarette butts contribute to littering, making it harder for staff to keep the environment clean. Prohibiting smoking would lead to a cleaner, more hygienic dining space.

In conclusion, smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants in the country. It endangers public health, disrupts the comfort of non-smokers, and negatively affects cleanliness. Restaurants are meant to be places of enjoyment, and a smoking ban would help create a healthier and more pleasant dining experience for everyone.
