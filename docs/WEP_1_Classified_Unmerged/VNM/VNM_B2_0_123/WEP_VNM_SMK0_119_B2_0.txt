"Nowadays, many people think that restaurants should forbidden smoking in their places. I strongly agree with this opinion. There are two main reasons why smoking should be banned.

Firstly, smoking affects not only the ones who smoke but also people around them. Smoke from the cigarettes contains lots of harmful substances which can cause severe health diseases. The effects of it is extremely worse when pregnant woman is the one who breathes it. Harmful chemicals from the smoke could lead to changes in the genes, and over time, the baby would be born being handicapped or extremely ill. 

Secondly, air pollution could be caused by smoking, especially restaurants which use air conditioners. They have to close all the door in order to keep the temperature low, and if someone smokes, the whole room could smell it. Although some restaurants do have smoking areas, there are still many cases that they forget to close the door or the smoke could get in through small holes. 

To conclude, people find that restaurants should not allow smoking, and I totally agree with this idea. By banning smoking, other people could have a fresh air to enjoy their meal and the people who smoke themselves might gain health benefits.  "
