I think smoking is not good. When people smoking, they make the air dirty and it is bad for health.  I worry about health problems when I have to be around people smoke. Many people don’t smoke but still need to breath the smoke when they go to eat, it is not fair for them. Specially children and old people can sick because of smoke. So I agree smoking should not allow in restaurant. When someone smoke in restaurant, the smell is very strong and other people don’t like it. It make the food not taste good anymore. Sometime the smoke go to the clothes and hair of customer and they feel angry. Restaurant is place to relax and enjoy food, not for smoke. Some people say smoking is freedom and they can do what they want. But I think freedom is good only when it not hurt other people. Smoke in public place is not private thing, it make other people danger too.In conclusion, I believe smoking should ban in all restaurant in the country. People can still smoke but not in place where many people eat. It is better for health, for clean air, and for everyone to feel comfort and happy when go out. Another way is to have a separate eating area for people who smoke
