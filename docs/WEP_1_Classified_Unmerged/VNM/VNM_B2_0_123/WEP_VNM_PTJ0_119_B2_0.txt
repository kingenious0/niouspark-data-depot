"In this day and age, many people who are currently college students tend to try to make money as soon as possible. They may find a job to do in their free time, and even tell their friends that it is necessary to do so. In contrast, many other students think that they should focus on their major first, and finding a job so soon is just a waste of time. In this passage, we will discuss both views.

On the one hand, many college students find that working and studying at the same time is crucial. Having a job early could help them gain experience and knowledge for their future career, which is a big benefit. Moreover, the thinking of making money is extremely appeal for the young, as they could buy stuffs with their own money and support their family. 

On the other hand, some people reckon that concentrating on their study is more important. Finding a part-time job may help you to gain experience for your career if only you working at the right place, doing the right work. Jobs such as waiter would not give you any knowledge about what you are studying, and you can only gain life skills from them. Instead, spend time improving yourself, getting more achievement which is essential for your CV. 

In conclusion, students have different views on whether they should get a job when they are still in university. Both views have its advantages and disadvantages, and the choices should be based on their major and free time. "
