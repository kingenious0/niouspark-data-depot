Taking the part-time job which is related to the major during the studing in the university or collegde will be the great way for students to apply their theory knowledge gained in the real life. This could help student interpret more about academic theory and compare to practical situation. Moreover, work experiences from these part-time jobs will have good impact on other future enterprises when students apply to get this job. Instead of only focusing on studying theory without any experiences in practical working environment, this candidate will not be assessed as high as the experienced ones. 
In addition, although students take a part-time jobs which is not consistant with their major, it could bring them more income. Some students, besides studying at college, they have to earn money to afford for their living expenditures and studying fees. Having salary will open more doors for students due to the fact that they can use that money to take part in more studying courses or buy necessary things... Getting a job in a professional environment is a chance for pupils to enhance their soft skills and become a active person in the future.
If students in colleges or universities have leisure time, they could consider to have a part-time job due to its benefits. "
