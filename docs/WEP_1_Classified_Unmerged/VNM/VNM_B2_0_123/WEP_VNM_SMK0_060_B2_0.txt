"Smoking has always been a controversial topic in the world, and whether restaurants should ban these actions is still an unsolved question. Personally, it is necessary for restaurants and eateries to halt the smoking trend due to their customers' health and the customers' experience.

The reason underneath this is smoking has been widely known for their disastrous effects on health. If there is anybody who can smoke freely at the eating place, then customers, especially babies and pregnant women may suffer the harmful smell that cigarettes bring. Regarding smoking, it is also notorious for lung cancer and other illnesses in terms of health. In consequence, restaurants need to mitigate this problem in order to stop spreading this downside effects to the other customers.

Another reason why banning smoking is necessary is because it will diminish the other customers' taste buds and experience. There is a large quantity of people who are allergic to smoke from cigarettes so they will see smoking as an unpleasant experience. Furthermore, indoor restaurants may want to avoid this situation since the smoke could turn a delectable course into a bad meal.

Long story short, smoking is a culprit behind tons of health issues and it could also affect the customers' experience on enjoying their food so restaurants should ban smoking in the near future. "
