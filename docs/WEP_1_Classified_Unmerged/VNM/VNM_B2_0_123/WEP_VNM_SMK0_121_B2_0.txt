"In this modern day, smoking is becoming more common among the young generation.However, it has negative health consequences for both the smoker and anyone else who inhales the smoke. Many people support and oppose the idea that smoking in public should be banned but I believe that smoking in public cannot be completely banned.
For starter, some people feel unpleasant when taking away their right to smoke. They believe that such a ban would violate their right. Secondly, people against the ban on smoking in public areas say that cigarettes are sold and advertised publicly, and banning them will not make any difference. Finally, it will be costly to ban public smoking and impose new regulations. As a result, they believe that the best solution is to separate active smokers from the general public. 
On the other hand, people who support to ban smoking in public have their own reasons to state. Firstly, smoking has a negative impact on your health. The most common cause of lung cancer is smoking cigarette. Active smokers are also more likely to develop tuberculosis and heart problems. Although the symptoms may appear gradually, they eventually lead to a major crisis. It affects not only the smoker, but also those around him. Both active and passive smokers can be effected, which calls for widespread support for a ban on smoking in public places. Secondly, it can leave bad influence to the young. As you know, smoking habits are frequently influenced by peer and colleague groups. When one spends a significant amount of time around smokers, it is very easy to pick up the habit especially teenagers. Hence, smoking should be banned in public areas to avoid such negative influences. 
In summary, I believe there should be designated smoking areas in public places. Bus stops, shopping malls, restaurants, and offices must all have separate smoking areas to ensure that addicted smokers are not harmed or affect to other people.
