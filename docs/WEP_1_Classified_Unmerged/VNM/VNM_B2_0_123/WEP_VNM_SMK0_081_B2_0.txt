"Lung cancer is one of the most popular diseases in this day and age. And the main reason comes from smoking. From my point of view, I totally agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country because of the long-term benefits of humankind.

There are some reasons why I have this viewpoint. Firstly, smoking is harmful not only for smokers but also for others who are exposed to smokers, especially children, pregnant women and those with respiratory conditions. Imagine you are having dinner in a restaurant with your family, and there is a man smoking next to you. This can cause irritation for you and people around him. A smoke-free environment ensures a more dining experience for everyone and promotes public health. Nowadays, there are many restaurants in Vietnam that apply a ban on smokers, this creates a cleaner and healthier atmosphere in the restaurants. Secondly, the lack of smokers at the restaurants creates a good image for the country to both the locals and tourists. 

In conclusion, smoking should be completely banned in restaurants due to health risks, negative impact on the dining experience, potential loss of customers, and dangers faced by employees."
