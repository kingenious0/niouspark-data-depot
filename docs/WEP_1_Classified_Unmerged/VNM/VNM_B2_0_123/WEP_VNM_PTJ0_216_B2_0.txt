I totally agree with this statement. For me, I want to be an independent person by the time I turned 18, therefore, I think it is really important for me to have a part-time job as a college students. At the moment, I am living in dorm of International University of Viet Nam, so the amount of money I have to pay the rent is quite cheap. Because of that, if I have a part-time job that can cover the rent payment, I can be proud of myself that I do not have to live dependent on my parents money. That feeling makes me think that Iâ€™m an independent person. However, about other college students, on the one hand , the ones who get financial support from their parents, they may think that a part-time job is just a waste of time. They tend to focus on other things, such as studying or spending the amount of money they receive every months. On the other hand, students who live in poor family would think that a part-time job is extremely necessary as a college student. It is important for them to be financially independent if they want to continue their studies. In conclusion, for me, I want to be an independent person as soon as possible by getting a part-time job while studying at college. But for some other people, the level of importance depends on their financial condition.
