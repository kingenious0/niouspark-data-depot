"In today's fast-paced world, whether students in university should have another source of income from doing a part-time job or not has become a hotly debated issue. From my perspective, I strongly agree with this argument since applying for a job early not only brings independence in finance but also improves life skills for college students.
  
One of the most crucial reasons to support this point of view is that the financial burden of their family will be alleviated and they will become independent in managing their money. With the aid from the salary, students have the ability to pay for their own life expenses such as food, transportation and entertainment. As a result, parents do not have to spend a huge amount of money to satisfy their personal needs apart from school fees or things related to studying. In some families who face the financial burden, children have to drop out of school to take a manual job to gain income. 

Another benefit from having a part-time job is that students who join the labour workforce at an early time can gain a lot of useful life skills. It is obvious that they will be trained by the senior or by the boss to help them maintain their work. Moreover, students are taught more profound knowledge that has never been mentioned in colleges. 

In conclusion, there is no doubt that having a job during college time will bring many benefits for students. "
