"To my perspective, smoking should be completely forbidden at all the culinary stores nationally. Several reasons are presented in the essay below.

First of all, smoke from cigarettes affects the atmosphere of the restaurant, as well as the mood of other customers. Sometimes it even affects the taste of the dishes. There are also some people who are allergic to the smoke, which can worsen the situation. Secondly, smoking is a private activity. Passive smoking also causes a lot of harm to our health because people who inhale smoke from cigarettes even get more serious illnesses than the smokers themselves. As a result, we could consider restricting smoking areas, so as to reduce the smoking rate and enhance a better environment for the others. 

On the other hand, smoking cannot be fully abandoned nationally. The government could provide a separated space for those who smoke, and the smokers themselves have to follow strictly the rules too. This paves a way to a healthier environment, as well as better living conditions in the country.

To sum up, smoking should undoubtedly be banned at any restaurants in our nation, in order to protect others' health issues, and to provide a more polite space for enjoying meals."
