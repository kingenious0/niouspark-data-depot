"I completely agree that smoking should be prohibited in all restaurants throughout the nation. Such a regulation is beneficial to individuals' health and improves dining experience for all.

First of all, prohibiting smoking in restaurants maintains the customers' and employees' health. That is to say, passive smoke is dangerous and has the potential to cause severe issues such as lung cancer and heart disease. When eating areas allow smoking, non-smokers, including children or pregnant women, are forced to face these risks. For instance, I once visited a restaurant that permitted smoking. There, the scent of tobacco made it difficult for me to appreciate my food because I was concerned about my health and other people.

On top of that, the restaurant environment can be improved through a smoking ban. Restaurants are where individuals dine to relax, but cigarette smoke spoils this. Cigarette smoke alters the flavor of food and makes it inconvenient for most individuals. A smoking ban allows all individuals, regardless of their preferences, to dine in comfort and joy.

To conclude, it is all about keeping individuals healthy and having a nice place to dine. Smokers can claim that they have rights, but other people's health and the reason why restaurants are for families are far more significant."
