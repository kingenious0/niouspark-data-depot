I partly agree and disagree with banning smoking completely at all restaurants. First, I agree that smoking should be banned because it affects people's health. Smoking is harmful for both smokers and non-smokers. Non-smokers get effects from secondhand smoke, so banning smoking in restaurants can stop this and protect customers and employees health. While smoking is directly affected by the components within the cigarette, which lead to smokers having bad health. Second, banning skimming creates a pleasant dining environment and attracts more customers, like families with kids. Last, it also helps smokers cut down on or even quit smoking, which helps with their long-term health benefits. On the other hand, banning smoking infringes on the personal rights of humans. Because there are people who believe that it is their own freedom to choose whether to smoke or not, which is something that we cannot change. Also, the restaurant can lose customers if they ban smoking. Which leads to an economic impact from revenue losses. Overall, banning smoking completely in restaurants can create a better environment and experiment between customers and employees within the restaurant, but it can also affect personal freedom, and people who smoke might feel they are not receiving respect from people around them.
