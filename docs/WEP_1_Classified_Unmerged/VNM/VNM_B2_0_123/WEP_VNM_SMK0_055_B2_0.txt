"Many people believe that smoking in restaurants should be completely banned so as not to affect those around them, and I think that opinion is completely correct.

First, smoking in restaurants will affect the atmosphere inside as well as the experience of other customers. No one wants to sit in a restaurant while enjoying the evening with their family in the stench of cigarette smoke, it will make people feel uncomfortable and not enjoy their precious time. This also causes the restaurant to be underrated and at risk of losing customers. In addition, smoking also increases the risk of fire, when cigarette butts are not completely extinguished or customers' carelessness will cause unnecessary incidents such as cigarettes catching on the tablecloth and causing a fire.

In addition, smokers themselves will not feel the taste of food because there is a chemical in cigarettes that reduces taste, meaning they will feel the food is bland and will not enjoy it. That makes their experience with the restaurant worse.

In short, I think restaurants should ban smoking or have separate tables for smokers so as not to affect both parties."
