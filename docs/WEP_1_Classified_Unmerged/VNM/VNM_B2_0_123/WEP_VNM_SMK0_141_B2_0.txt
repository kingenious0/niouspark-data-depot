"I strongly agree that smoking should be completely prohibited at all restaurants in the country. This is because smoking not only harms the smoker but also affects the health of other people nearby.
First, secondhand smoke is dangerous. When people smoke in restaurants, others are forced to breathe in the smoke, even if they do not smoke themselves. This can cause health problems like lung disease, asthma, and even cancer. Restaurants are public places where families, children, and elderly people eat, and everyone has the right to breathe clean air.
Second, banning smoking in restaurants can improve the overall dining experience. The smell of smoke can ruin the taste and smell of food. Many customers feel uncomfortable eating near someone who is smoking. If restaurants are completely smoke-free, more people will enjoy going out to eat and feel more relaxed.
Third, allowing smoking can damage the restaurant’s image. Today, more people care about health and a clean environment. A smoke-free restaurant looks more modern and responsible. It also shows that the owners care about their customers and staff.
In conclusion, smoking should be banned in all restaurants to protect people’s health and create a better atmosphere for everyone. A complete ban will lead to cleaner air, happier customers, and a healthier country.
