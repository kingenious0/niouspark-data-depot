"It is commonly believed that authorities should impose a prohibition on smoking at all the restaurants in the country, while others are against this opinion. Both view will be discussed and I believe banning smoking in restaurants is necessary to protect public health. 

Granted, one might argue that there should be a ban on smoking as these are likely to cause some health risks. This is predicated on the assumption that when people smoke in enclosed spaces like restaurants, toxic chemicals are released into the air, putting non-smokers at risk, which is extremely dangerous for children, pregnant women, and people with asthma or heart conditions. Besides, the smell of cigarette smoke can ruin the taste and enjoyment of food, discouraging customers who prefer a clean, pleasant dining environment. 

On the one hand, opponents of the ban may argue that it can restrict personal freedom. In recent years, there have been many designated smoking areas within restaurants which can be a fair compromise, allowing both smokers and non-smokers to be together. Moreover, a smoke-free environment is more likely to attract a wider range of customers and improve overall customer satisfaction, which can benefit the business in the long run.

In conclusion, although some people may see smoking as a personal choice, public health and comfort should take priority. A complete smoking ban in all restaurants is necessary to protect non-smokers, create a pleasant dining environment, and promote healthier lifestyles."
