"I completely agree with the statement that smoking should be forbidden in restaurants in the country. 

The odour smog coming from cigarettes, cigars can negatively affect surrounding people trying to use their meals, and the toxic fume is infamous for harmful impacts on human health. Being in an enclosed restaurant with smokers surely is not a pleasant experience for non-smokers.

Smoking is not only harmful to the smokers but everyone around them that inhales the smog. The respiratory system in a human body, or any other creatures, when inhaling smoke may be vulnerable to serious illness. There may be people who are more vulnerable to the smoke of cigarettes in the restaurants like children, pregnant women, people with lung diseases, the elderly, and more. Not everyone's immune system is as capable of dealing with the smoke.

The odour from smoking can remain in the air and in the furniture of a restaurant, thus creating a negative atmosphere. You should not be smelling any weird smells in a decent restaurant, anyway. There also lies fire hazards with smoking. Throwing away cigarettes carelessly, with flammable materials in contact, can cause a fire affecting the safety of everyone in the building. 

In summary, people's lives must be prioritized and kept protected at all times, at any places in the country."
