"I completely agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. This policy is crucial for maintaning public health and  ensuring the comfort of all customers. 
First, Exposure to second-hand smoke poses significant health risks to fellow customers. Studies have shown that exposure to second-hand smoke can increase the risk of respiratory problems or even lung cancer within non-smokers. By smoking at a restaurants, the smokers is not just willfully harming themselves but also endangers the health of childrens, the elderly or the staffs who are likely present within the resturants at all times. 
Second, smoking bans discourage smoking and thus contribute to a cleaner enviroment overall. Cigar and cigarette butts are a consistent sources of litter, further still burning cigar and cigarette butts inherent introduce an additional risk of fire within a resturant. 
Third, smoking ruins both the appetiate and palate of its smokers as well as fellow customers. Smoking dulls the smoker sense of taste by decreasing taste sensitivity. Further cigarette smoke is very unpleasant to and ruin the taste of food for non-smokers.
Some may argue that smokers have the inherently freedom to smoke whenever they wants, whereever they wants. I agree with the fact that smokers have the right to smoke whenever they wants, however this right should not come at the cost of others health and comfort.
In conclusion, prohibiting smoker from smoking in restaurants is a step toward improving public health, creating a better enviroment for diners, minimizie the risks of tragedy occuring from fire occuring in restaurants."
