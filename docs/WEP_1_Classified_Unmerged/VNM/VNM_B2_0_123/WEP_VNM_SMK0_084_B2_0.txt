"As we know that, restaurant is the busy place with all ages, from kids to adult people. So, there are some people say that "Smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country". I partly agree with this statement because of the following reasons in this essay.

It is obvious that smoking is not good for our health, it destroys our lungs a lot, especially with children. There are a lot of articles about cigarettes destroy our health, so restaurants need to ban smoking in their places. For example, some kids live with family which have a smoking member, kids may not have good health as the other ones. 

The next reason is that some people do not like the smell of the cigarettes. So they are really uncomfortable if they smell the smoke while they are eating. For instance, some customers may be angry and complain with the manager about the smoke. So that, restaurants should ban smoking.

Smoking may not be banned completely, restaurants can open one room for smoking if they want to have more customers. Because some people they cannot quit smoking, so opening one room for them to smoke is the good idea. Other customers can not smell it, but smoking people can smoke without making other people feel uncomfortable.

In conclusion, smoking is not good for customers' health. But smoking may be allowed in one room in restaurants, which may not cause other people to feel uncomfortable about smoking."
