"Many people agree that smoking makes them feel uncomfortable. T totally agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country for only one reason.
Cigarette smoke has a harmful impact on the user and everyone who smells this. It can cause cough, lung cancer, reduction in breath, especially in pregnant women and kids. These people appear a lot in public places like restaurants. For instance, my family used to have meals at a local restaurant every saturday. However, we sat next to a group of smoking people. Despite our gentle reminder, they still smoke a lot. Although we immediately change our seats, we still feel inconvenient and hard to breathe. My little sister was sick on that day and unfortunately she coughed more after having meals at that restaurant. Another day, my pregnant sister had her body full of cigarette smoke when having a meal in another restaurant. Fortunately, she just had a little headache and the baby was still ok. Therefore, the banned regulation about smoking at restaurants can improve their customersâ€™ health.
In conclusion, smoking cigarettes causes many health problems for users and others around. So that banned regulation rule at restaurants is reasonable."
