"Some people think that all the restaurants in the country should completely ban smoking. I disagree with this opinion as I believe that creating smoking rooms along with punishment will be a better way for restaurant business following two main reasons.
             The first reason is that if all restaurants ban smoking, not many smokers are willing to hang out for a meal. Therefore, this will affect the restaurant's revenue, especially with the ones having a lot of smoking customers.
             The second reason is that creating smoking rooms along with punishment is a better alternative solution for this method that can satisfy both smokers and non-smokers as well as minimize negative impact on restaurants' business. As this will allow smokers to satisfy their need if they want while they are having meals. Besides, it also ensures that non-smoking customers' experience and health will not be affected. If smokers do not obey this rule, then restaurants should make smokers pay a fine as a punishment.
            To sum up, banning smoking completely at all the restaurants over the country seems a good solution at first, however, this will create adverse impacts on restaurants' business. Therefore, I believe that creating smoking areas along with a punishment will be an optimal solution for both restaurants and customers.
