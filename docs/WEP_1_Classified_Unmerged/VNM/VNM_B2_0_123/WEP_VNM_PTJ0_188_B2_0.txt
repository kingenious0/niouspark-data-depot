"As a result of the economic downturn, more and more college students have wishes to have a part-time job to cover a part of their tuition fee so that their parents will not have to worry as much about the financial problems. However, this action may have significant affection to the student's study process. From my perspective, not every college student is required to have a part-time job. 
Firstly, having a part-time job requires students to sacrifice their study time for work. In reality, most part-time jobs are naturally physical tasks in which workers have to put lots of physical energy. That problem leads to an obvious result, students will run out of their energy for learning and could not pay all attention to it, which may make their grades worsen.
Secondly, if students want to have more money to cover their tuition fee, I can study harder to get a scholarship from their school to solve the problem. Nowadays, there are numerous scholarships created to help studious student overcome their obstacle in their learning path.  By using the opportunity cost theory, it is clear to see that the opportunity cost of studying hard to get a scholarship is higher than having a part-time job and sacrificing study time. A scholarship requires students to show their potential, so they need to try hard in both their learning and extracurricular activities to win a scholarship and that will benefit them both in the present and future. 
In conclusion, having a part-time job is not a bad thing, it depends on the student's situation but having a part-time job is not a crucial thing for university students."
