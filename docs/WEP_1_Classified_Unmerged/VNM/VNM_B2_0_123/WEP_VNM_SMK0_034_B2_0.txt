"In recent years, more people develop the habit of smoking. Much as smoking was proved to be unhealthy the smokers and passive smokers, many people still practice smoking in public places, especially restaurants. From my perspective, I concur with the notion that the government should prohibit smoking in restaurants, due to health concerns and social effects arise from this practice.
First and foremost, in the settings of restaurants, smoking can pose a serious threat to public health. Most restaurants are designed to be closed areas that can host a large number of visitors, where they can gather to enjoy meals and meet people. When someone smokes in a restaurant, non-smokers are also standing chances of being exposed to toxic fumes coming from the smokers. This can result in serious health issues related to the respiratory system, as well as putting the health of people of vulnerable groups, especially children and the elderly, in danger. Therefore, it is undeniable that smoking in these areas should be banned to protect public health.
Secondly, the practice of smoking in restaurants can also create negative public images and negative impacts on society as a whole. By allowing people to smoke in these places, people are condoning irresponsible behaviours and giving these individuals a chance to do so. Moreover, due to their curious nature, children may be influenced by these smokers and pick up the habit as well. By stopping people from smoking irresponsibly, society is also preventing future smokers from younger generations as well.
To conclude, I advocate the idea of preventing smokers from smoking in restaurants due to aforementioned reasons. It will take a collaborative effort between the governments and citizens to create smoke-free public areas in the future."
