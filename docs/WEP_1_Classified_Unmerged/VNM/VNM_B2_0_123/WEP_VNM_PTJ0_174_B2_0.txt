For me, having a part time job plays an important role in college students. There are many reasons that explains why college students should take part in part time job. Firstly, doing work can increases their soft skills. Students can learn how to communicate with clients, how to manage their time to finish their tasks on time. Therefore, it enhances their soft skills, contributing to their success. Besides that, having a job is a good way to make friends. Students can break their ice through their works and have same interest to make friends. Futhermore, students can use their knowledge at their school into their part time job which help student gain on practical experiences. It is a good way to build a strong foundation in their career. For example, students who study in technology that work as a part time coder, contributing to their experiences in a technology industry. On the other hand, working as a part time job can help students make ends meet. Due the high living expenses in the cities, many students need to work to cover rental house fee and food. To sum up, it is crucial for college students to experience a part time job.
