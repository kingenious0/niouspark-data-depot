"I disagree with the statement that students should have a part-time job, especially if the job is not related to their studies at college. 

While making money on the side can help them and their family's financial situation, the main purpose of going to college is to study at advanced levels to help them get better job opportunities and occupations. Working part-time can lead them astray from the importance of acquiring knowledge at college.

Not everyone is a genius to the point of not needing to study and still get good grades. College students need time to research and understand the study materials on their own. Having a part-time job can take up a lot of their time that could have been spent on studying a subject. And a subject in college and university is as challenging as another. A student must have good time management skills in order to cope with the study and the working hours as a part-time employee. There are even cases where students voluntarily skip classes in order to work elsewhere, furthermore reducing time for academic work and even receiving lower grades in class.

Having a part-time job unrelated to the major that the college students are studying is rarely beneficial in terms of essential knowledge and skills for their future occupation. I can't imagine myself being a restaurant server and gaining knowledge for the E-Commerce major that I'm dedicated to."
