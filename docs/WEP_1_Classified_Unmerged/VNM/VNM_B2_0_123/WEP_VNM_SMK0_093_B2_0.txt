"Smoking has many disadvantages and risks for people's health. However, in my opinion, I believe that we can find another solution that is better than banning smoking at all restaurants in our country completely. 

Firstly, we can build another room for smoking. As can be seen, this way is applied at many restaurants and other stores all around the world. We don't need to use the negative and strict way to solve the problems, although we can do the better one. 

Secondly, if we ban smoking completely, it can affect smokers negatively. It is easy to ban it in our country, but it can receive negative comments about it from other people. It would lead to a decrease in the restaurant's revenue. 

Lastly, I think we cannot ban others smoking if we cannot ban producing cigarettes. It is hard to ban someone using if that product is still produced. Besides that, we can ban the allowance to smoke inside the restaurants, and then those people can go outside if they want to smoke. 

In conclusion, I think that we have many other solutions to do, so that we should not use the negative way is banning smoking completely at all restaurants in our country.
