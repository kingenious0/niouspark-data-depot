"The question whether having a part-time job is necessary for undergraduates has been widely debated. Personally, I think these students should have one because of its benefits it can bring. 
First, when taking up a part-time job, college students can be more independent. These students who had not experienced working part-time might rely on their parents or relatives for tuition fees and living expenses, which can be changed if they can make money from their own part-time job. They can self-pay for these costs, not being reliant on their family. Furthermore, holding a part-time job can help these students understand the true value of money at a young age. Because they have to work hard to get money as college students, they would appreciate the money they earn and therefore, they may have a better saving plan.
Additionally, those undergraduates would be able to get more practical experiences when taking up a part-time job related to their study major. They would have to work for other people, be responsible for what they do and get more knowledge about what their future job would be like. These experiences can only be provided at the workspace, not at university. Granted, some might say that part-time jobs can affect badly to students’ study as it is time-consuming, thus they might get bad study results. However, a part-time job only takes a small amount of time in a college student’s day, which still leaves him enough time to take care of his study.   
In conclusion, having a part-time job can help college students to be more financially stable and have more major-related experience, which makes part-time jobs become an important part undergraduates’ life."
