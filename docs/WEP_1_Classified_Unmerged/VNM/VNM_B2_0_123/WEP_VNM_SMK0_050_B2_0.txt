"Many people say that smoking should be totally restricted at all the restaurants. Although there are plausible reasons for this, I disagree with this point of view.
Of course, when smoking publicly at restaurants, not only the smokers but also people around can be affected negatively. These people can be second smokers, and in long-run, there would be a great likelihood that they would get some respiratory problems. However, there might be a better way to avoid this. Restaurants should build up a smoking area where their customers who are smokers can come their to smoke without causing harm to others.
Another reasons why restaurants should not ban all smokers from their place is that this can cause a loss of their customers. Smoking is now still popular in some areas. When eating out at a restaurant with a ban on smoking, these smokers would feel upset or even annoying as they have to give up their habit in a period of time. This angriness may prevent these people from coming back to that restaurant. 
A good way to address this problem is to have a special area where smoking is allowed in each restaurants. For example, Aeon Mall – a large shopping center has built this place for smoking people and get many positive feedbacks from smokers and non-smokers in the country.
In conclusion, enacting a ban on smoking at all restaurants would cause a bad effect on the restaurants’ income. Instead, these restaurants should build their own smoking area to satisfy both smokers and other customers. "
