"I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants across the country, as it poses serious health risks to non-smokers, creates an unpleasant dining experience, and undermines public health efforts.

To begin with, secondhand smoke is a major health hazard. Numerous studies have shown that exposure to smoke, even for a short period, can lead to respiratory problems, heart disease, and even cancer in non-smokers. Restaurants are public spaces where people, including children and the elderly, gather to enjoy meals. Allowing smoking in such environments puts innocent people at risk simply for choosing to dine out.

In addition, smoking in restaurants creates an uncomfortable and often offensive atmosphere. The smell of smoke can spoil the taste and enjoyment of food for many customers. For businesses, this can result in lost clientele, especially as more people become health-conscious and prefer smoke-free environments. By banning smoking, restaurants can attract a wider customer base and offer a cleaner, more enjoyable dining experience.

Moreover, a nationwide ban would support broader public health campaigns. Governments around the world are working to reduce smoking rates and promote healthier lifestyles. Banning smoking in all restaurants would reinforce the message that smoking is not socially acceptable in public spaces, encouraging more people to quit and discouraging young people from starting.

While some may argue that designated smoking areas within restaurants could be a compromise, in reality, smoke often drifts and affects others. A complete ban is the only truly effective way to protect everyone.

In conclusion, I fully support a nationwide ban on smoking in restaurants. Such a policy would protect public health, enhance customer satisfaction, and contribute to a cleaner, healthier society."
