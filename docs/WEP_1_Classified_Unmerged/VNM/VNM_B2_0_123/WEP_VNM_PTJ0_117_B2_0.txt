"There is a school of thought that it is of vital significance for college students to have a partâ€“time job besides studies. Personally, I wholeheartedly agree with this given viewpoint due to its numerous glaring benefits to student's lives.

By having a golden chance to work part-time, college students may have the ability to enhance their vital soft skills for their career in the future. This is because they would have a face-to-face interaction with customers, colleagues or also employers about workload in their own working environment. For example, when a university student applies for the position of teaching assistant in an English center, he/ she can sharpen some soft skills like class management and communication skills when they teach in the class or when they have a talk with their colleagues, employers or pupils' parents. As a result, it would act as a springboard for college students to gain more experience and confidence in communication and working life when graduating from university and also getting well prepared for landing a steady job in the near future.
 
Last but not least, this activity can be seen as a small source of income for college students. Some university students will feel happy and satisfied because they can earn little money and then buy necessities to meet their basic demands. This will lead to an independent college student's life as they can strike a balance between studying and working, which is of utmost importance in this day and age.
 
In conclusion, I fully agree with the viewpoint that it is advisable for college students to have a part-time job due to its plus points mentioned above.
