"It is believed that there are some undeniable drawbacks for college students to have a part-time job due to facing challenges in work-life balance and other several factors. However, I also maintain the opinion that having a job for students when they are still in university bring more benefits than disadvantages.
On the one hand, the argument that university students should not have a part-time job is reasonable to some extent. Firstly, university students will easily concentrate on working rather than studying in case of financial strain is increasing and earning money become a strong motivation. For example, students may choose to work shifts at a coffee shop over study to pay more attention for the short-term financial benefits than knowledge. 
On the other hand, although the disadvantages of having casual employment have a significant impact, the value of part-time jobs during college should not be underestimated due to some reasons. Primarily, students working part-time can gain valuable experience that can greatly improve their readiness for future occupation. Nowadays, a lot of employers search for candidates who have both real experience and academic credentials, leading to a high unemployment rate among new graduates. Hence, students who proactively seek part-time work can help them better understand the professional world, develop specialist skills, and build a network resulting in better competitive advantages in the future. Additionally, working part-time offers students an opportunity to develop essential life skills that is not taught in the classroom. Time management, for instance, becomes students’ juggle and if they can manage well, those will become vital skills to use in their professional environment afterward.
In conclusion, despite the negative impact of having part-time jobs for college students, I still believe that the advantages are outweigh the disadvantages."
