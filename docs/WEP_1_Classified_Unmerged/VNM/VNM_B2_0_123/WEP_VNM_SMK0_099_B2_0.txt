"Smoking has always been a hectic issue from all over the world. This essay will discuss whether a complete ban should be applied to all the restaurants in the country or not and give my own opinion about this problem.

First and foremost, many people choose smoking to relieve their pain, and when they get stressed they need nicotine in cigarettes to make their mood better but nicotine is an addictive ingredient, which is harmful for not only their health but also others' health. In the restaurants, which are mostly built indoors. Because of that, the guests inside may not get enough fresh air and when they allow smokers in the restaurants, the non-smoking guests may get less fresh air than usual and the air is now polluted because of the smoking air relieved by the smokers and the air is not circulated properly. In addition to this, the polluted air negatively affects the normal people's health and may cause severe problems. Children's health is affected mostly because even normal adults can not suffer from that dangerous smoke. 

In conclusion, I completely agree that a complete ban on smoking in all restaurants is necessary. In a larger scale, the smokers should only smoke in restricted areas, which design for them to smoke and to prevent the negative effects for normal people and children.
