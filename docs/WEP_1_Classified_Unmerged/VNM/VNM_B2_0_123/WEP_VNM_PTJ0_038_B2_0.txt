"Nowadays, some college students are working some part-time jobs to earn money that leads to neglect of their studies. Some people think that it is not recommended to work part-time because it will affect their studies a lot.  Personally, i disagree with this statement 
Firstly, working some part-time heavy jobs takes a lot of energy, leading to not having much energy to go to school. When we go to school, we need a lot of energy to learning in the easiest way. For example, my friend is a student at an International University, currently working part-time at a convenience store GS25, because of the nature of the work, he has to work night shifts frequently, leading to morning lessons, he is often absent and does not go to school, leading to being banned from taking exams. 
Secondly, part-time work also affects health, studying becomes more difficult for college students. Currently, part-time jobs such as driving technology motorbike are more popular for students because it is easy to get a job, which leads to popularity. For instance, according to Báo Mới there are some college student having an accident while driving. The consequences are very tragic for the family and greatly affect the study. 
In conclusion, while there are potential benefits to having a part-time job during college, such as financial support and work experience, the drawbacks must also be considered. The primary focus for college students should be their academic success and personal development. Juggling a job alongside demanding coursework can lead to increased stress, reduced academic performance, and limited time for extracurricular activities and social interactions.  "
