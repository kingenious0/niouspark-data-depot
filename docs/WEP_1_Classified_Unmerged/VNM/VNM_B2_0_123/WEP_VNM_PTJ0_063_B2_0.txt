"Nowadays, students in university or college usually get a part–time job to earn money for paying in their daily life. Some people say that "It is important for college students to have a part-time job," and I totally agree with this opinion. Having a job during their study may help them develop some skills.

Firstly, students who have a part-time job would get some social skills such as communication, teamwork, and so on. For example, if students apply for the waitress position in the restaurant, they would be learned about serving the guests politely, ordering and bringing the foods,…Therefore, they will know how to communicate with people and how to do teamwork when they do the waitress job. Besides, they can also get knowledge and skills from their manager or boss. For example, they can look at their manager's work and ask them about their job and they can also learn the management's skill from real life. This would help them a lot when they apply for a job after graduation.

Secondly, students can earn their own money to pay for everything they want without depending on their parents. They can use that money to pay for renting house, electricity bill, water bill,… and so on. Getting a part-time job would help college students live more independently and also help their parents not spend too much money for their study in college.

In conclusion, getting a part-time job is good for college students cause they can get social skills, learning and earning their own money using in daily life. However, students who get part-time jobs must be careful because there are too many fake companies that can trick college students in modern life. Also, they must be focus on their study and get good mark for good graduation. "
