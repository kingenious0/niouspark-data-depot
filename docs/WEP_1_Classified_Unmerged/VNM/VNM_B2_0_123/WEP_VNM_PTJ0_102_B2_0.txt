"It is said that students, especially college students now have to worry about their financial problems, which come from tuition fees, living expenses, or money to rent an apartment where they can stay and benefit from the its shortened distance from colleges and universities. I agree with the idea that it is important for college students to have a part-time job to some extent.

People living around college students, which are their relatives, parents, friends, â€¦ usually put a certain pressure on them. By telling something with the intention to remind them of finding a job so that they can help their parents. Earning money from a part-time job is a good thing to do, it is a temporary solution to help students solving some issues about money in their daily lives. 

However, that is the case if you can manage time and make sure that your jobs do not make you waste time. The important purpose of students entering a school or university is to gain knowledge about their majors, or something related to their main job in the future. That is the reason why they should determine their own goals from the beginning before taking other part-time jobs. Otherwise, they will waste time, which is supposed to be used for a more important goal, just to earn money to eating snacks and hanging out with friends. 

In conclusion, students have the choice of choosing jobs which are fit to their studying schedule. An appropriate wage will help them deal with small expenses in their life such as bus fees, sometimes meals and make parents happy. "
