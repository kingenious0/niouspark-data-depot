Nowadays, most college students tend to find a part time job as soon as they start learning. A school of thought holds that having a part time job as a collegian is an important thing. However, I have to disagree with this statement. First of all, it might have a negative effect on the study results of students. This is mostly because students will have to separate time and energy to either work and learn. Working can cause tiredness and exhaustion which decrease concentration at school. Secondly, students' physical and mental health could be severely damaged if they can not balance the time they used for working and studying. Some pay too much attention to their part-time job that they even skip their university classes just to go to work and earn money. Meanwhile, the main purpose of going to college is studying, which is their duty and responsibility. Besides, the university years are mainly for personal growth and exploring activities. Choosing to have a job can make college students miss out on many opportunities to develop soft skills and build a strong social network which may help them a lot in their future. However, it can not be denied that a part-time job do help the young by creating a new experience. Students can have a more open mind and experience life sooner which is also helpful for them. In conclusion, doing a part-time job as a collegian has both good and bad sides. College students can have a job during their college years as long as they have a good time management skill. However, it should be limited as little as possible.
