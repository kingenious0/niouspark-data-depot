"There are some statement has been made indicates that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. Even though there are some positive impact, I strongly agree with this statement.

Smoking is not only a individual problem, it also affect other people in a bad way. Firstly, smoking can be extremely harmful for a human’s health. There are numerous amount of scientific research shows that smoking can damage the lungs because there are more than 300 toxic chemicals used to made a single cigarette, inhaling those chemicals for a long period of time will be a burden to the respiratory system to carry. Smoking is the main reason for lung cancer not only that, it is the factor contributes to heart illness, diabetes and the list goes on. Inhaling smoke in a passive way can be as harmful with the same health issues. Furthermore, it is extremely dangerous that a pregnant women inhales smoke from another person because it is deadly to the baby and can cause miscarriage. Therefore, it not only should be banned from a restaurant causing everyone to lose their appetite, it should restricted in the community as well. 

In conclusion, cigarette should be restricted due to its negative influence on the society for everyone’s health.
