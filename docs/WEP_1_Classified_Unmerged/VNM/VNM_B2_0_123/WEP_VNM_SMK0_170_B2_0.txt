In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. First, the smoke is really harmful especially to secondhand smokers. The smokers not only do harm to themself but also to everyone around them. A number of studies demonstrate that smoke-free regulations enhance the quality of the air in local areas and reduce the risk of heart attacks. In restaurants, where families come to have lunch or dinner and maybe there are also babies coming with them. This smoke can do harm to the healthy baby who doesn't have enough resistance. Beside that, the workers will also breathe the air that is full of smoke. Protecting these workers also helps reduce public health costs and ensures a safer workplace. Many people think that a smoking ban will reduce revenue of some related industries but it also reduces the number of deaths caused by smoking and diseases such as cancer. Furthermore, smoking is also one of the main causes of fires caused by sparks. Smokers are careless in putting out their cigarettes and this leads to fires and worse, injuries. In conclusion, a complete smoking ban in restaurants not only improves health and environment, but also boosts customer satisfaction, saves costs, and promotes positive long-term cultural change.
