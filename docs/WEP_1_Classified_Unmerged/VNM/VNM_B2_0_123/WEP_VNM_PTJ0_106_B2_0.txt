"In this day and age, it is common for undergraduates to have a part-time job besides studying at school. I believe this phenomenon is beneficial for the young generation, although it does bring some significant drawbacks.

On the one hand, I strongly support the idea of having a part-time job while studying college. Firstly, it helps teenagers to become more mature, more empathy, more emotional intelligence. Also, interacting with many kinds of people helps them know how to communicate in public, flexibly handle unpredicted situations, ... Secondly, having a job helps students with their living spending, study fees, or personal costs. To students' families who are poor, this is a large support on education path. In some remote areas, many families who can't afford the educational fee force their children to become a farmer, or help with the family business. 

On the other hand, part-time jobs do not always come with good consequences. A common situation is that teenagers are too focused on making a living, spending all their time working, which result in bad marks at school, then they have to restudy. It's even worse when undergraduates can earn a lot from their jobs, they start to find studying boring, time-consuming and finally quit their school. On social media, the young generation is informed a lot about influencers, famous people who succeeded after quitting school, but life is not always easy like that, there are many people who failed and have to do hard labor jobs for the rest of their life, so this is not to recommended.

In conclusion, I think having a part-time job when studying college is beneficial, but students need to balance with work and studying, in order to gain benefits from both."
