"In this day and age, almost every people are informed about the disadvantages of cigarettes. Especially in restaurants, where people come to eat and drink, I strongly believe that these harmful things should not be entered.

On the one hand, I am sure that everybody knows that smoking is harmful for our health. Firstly, it brings cancer and badly affects your lungs. Many news and studies have showed that people who usually smoke has shorter life-expectancy, weaker health when they easily have serious diseases when they get older. Not only cigarettes affect the people who use it, but also the people near them. Because of that, I believe it should be officially banned in public places, especially restaurants, where there are many people, from young kids to the elderly come to have food. It is even worse when pregnant women and kids have to smell the toxic environment around it. 

On the other hand, there has been many solutions made to handle this problem. Many places now are offered a special area to smoke so that it won't affect other people. In order for this rule to be listened, the government should have an official announcement, ban the rules, hard fees for people who underestimate it.

In conclusion, I believe the idea of banning cigarettes in public places like restaurants are totally right, understandable should be widely used on over the country."
