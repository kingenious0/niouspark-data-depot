It's common sense that I, together with everyone in this earth, agree that smoking should definitely be banned at all establishments across all countries, with all the existing evidence of health-related issues throughout the web. Firstly, a ban can shield the health and well-being of non-smokers, including children, expectant women and individuals with respiratory problems. There have been overwhelmingly scientific studies across the world on the effect of passive smoking or exposure to second-hand smoke on humans and those studies point out that it can cause lung cancer, asthma and heart attacks. Restaurants are a common place for people to  eat, socialize and be themselves. They should not be subjected to toxins simply because it so happened that there are smokers in the room. Secondly, a ban improves the dining experience. The smell of smoke is nothing pleasant and it can ruin the aroma of the food and mood of the diners. An environment free of smoke can cultivate a sense of elegance and responsibility, which restaurant owners can create to appeal a wider range of customers, both existing and potential customers, making restaurants more and more enjoyable.
