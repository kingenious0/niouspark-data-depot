"These days, some individuals suppose that having a part-time job is important for college students. In my opinion, I agree with the above statement that students should do a part-time job when they still study at the university. 

There are many reasons why a part-time job is important for students to do besides their studying and participating in other activities at college. Firstly, college students can make some bucket money for their basic demands such as food, beverage, entertainment, ... or even their rent cost. They can pay for their living costs without asking money from their parents, which is also the way that they can support their family's finances. 

Secondly, students will learn how to manage and spend money effectively. Part-time jobs will help them to understand how difficult money is made. Therefore, they will appreciate more about the value of the money and find a way to manage it effectively in order not to waste their time and effort. 

Thirdly, they also learn a lot of soft skills such as time management, communication skills or the ability to find the solutions to sudden situations through the period of doing part-time jobs. These soft skills are not often taught at school by teachers, but they can acquire these skills much easier through practicing while doing part-time jobs.  

In conclusion, I totally agree with the opinion that it is crucial for college students to do a part-time job due to a lot of benefits that they can gain from doing this work such as bucket money, financial management and soft skills. "
