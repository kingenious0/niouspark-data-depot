"It is argued that smoking should be totally prohibited at all restaurants in the country. This essay will demonstrate my opinion of partly agree to this statement. 
The reason why some people have said that there is no permission for smoking in restaurants is because of the harmful influences of smoke emitted on people's health including customers and restaurant's staff, especially babies. It is proved by science that people who breath smoke will be detrimentally impacted more than the smokers. Restaurant is the place where people would like to enjoy their meal, relax to get better mental and physical healthy. The appearance of smoking will decrease the quality of restaurant's environment and be negative to the satisfaction of customers.
On the other hand, if these cigaretes are not banned by the goverment, restaurants are able to prepare a separate and private place for people who want smoking. It not only puts great impression to smokers but also satisfies other customers without polluting the whole restuarant' atmosphere. 
In conclusion, each restaurant should consider seriously to make decision of whether banning smoking or not. It could be the main factor impacting on the restaurant's revenue and customer's willing rate to return to use this restaurant's services. "
