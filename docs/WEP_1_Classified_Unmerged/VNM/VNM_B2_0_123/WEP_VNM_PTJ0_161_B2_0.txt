"Over the past few years, there has been a debate of whether or not adolescents should have a part-time job when they are above 18. Some may support that idea because they strongly believe that the young are not mature enough to independently take responsibility for their life. From my point of view, I agree that it is essential for college students to have a part-time job, which will be outlined in the following paragraphs.

To begin with, gaining more experience before getting into the job market is vital to students in university. College students can learn how an organization operates from the small ones to larger ones when they have part-time jobs in many fields like marketing, supply chain, finances,... For example, if a college student wants to become a senior auditor in the future, he or she can work as an accountant intern from their third-year in university to help him or her know more about the documents as well as improve their excel skills.

Secondly, development of soft skills such as communication, time management, and teamwork. is another merit because it helps students gain a better understanding of the professional environment. When students get a job when they are still studying at university, they have to learn how to balance between life and working. Therefore, they develop their time-management skills, which do not make them feel tired after a hard-working day. Moreover, they know how to work efficiently with other team members as well as develop their communication skills with their colleagues. 

Taking all of the aforementioned ideas into consideration, having a part-time job when studying at the university possesses a variety of cons in terms of their experience of soft skills."
