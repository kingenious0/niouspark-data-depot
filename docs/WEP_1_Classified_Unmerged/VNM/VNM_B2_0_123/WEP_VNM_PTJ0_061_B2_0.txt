"Whether we believe it or not, the cost of living has gone up drastically over the past few years. So many workers got laid off because their company could not afford paying too many employees, notably, a part of these workers are parents with children in university, which mean they can only give their offsprings lower allowance, that is why, college students should have a part time job to support themselves financially. 

Firstly, most universities are located on cities, which are very costly to live, so students have to face numerous expenses that will most likely make them struggle at the end of the month, so an additional income from part-time job will definitely help them make ends meet. 

Secondly, these jobs not only give them money, but also give them the knowledge, the experience helping them later when they join the workforce, as the working environment requires more than plain knowledge from school, they must possess important skills such as time-management skill, collaboration skillâ€¦ to achieve higher salary as well as higher position within the company, all of these can be found in part-time jobs. 

Lastly, because it is part-time, learners do not need to spend ten hours a day on these jobs, most side jobs like that only take workers about one to three hours a day, students still have time to take care of their study at school, then after college, they will graduate with not just a degree, but working experience to put on the CV. 

As part-time jobs provide so many benefits for college students that stay with them their whole life, I strongly agree that college students should have a part-time job. "
