"Speaking from the view of a college student, having a part-time job is indeed important.

But it must depend on the kind of job that the college students do. To make it easy to understand, students who are majoring in Art/Music should take commissions (taking art or music commissions through social platforms, etc.) as their side job, or for the Computer Science or Economics students, they should do jobs that are relevant to their majors too. It is to made sure that they can focus on their talents and do things that they good at, making them have more experiences instead of doing other part-time jobs that can't, or not likely to support their skills for their future jobs. 

However, some specific jobs require high-level skills and knowledge, such as engineers, doctors, lawyers, etc. It is better for them to focus more on the academic side and scholarships. But a part-time job should stay as a part-time job. Even though I do support college students to have one, but they should be more cautious and care more on their academic side.

Finally, having a part-time job is crucial, but college students should do more research about their major and future jobs before choosing a suitable part-time job that will not waste their time and skills. "
