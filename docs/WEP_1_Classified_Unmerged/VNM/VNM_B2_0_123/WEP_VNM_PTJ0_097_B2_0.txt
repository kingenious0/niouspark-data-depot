"In this age, people can see that part-time jobs for college students is the popular trend. Many arguments about this phenomenon have been mentioned with 2 different directions, including approval of disclaim. This essay will obviously analyze and claim some specific opinion for this problem. 

First and foremost, there is no denying the many benefits of having a part-time job early. Many individuals in 1st year at university choose the way to find a part-time job for improving financial problems, even supporting the family background. Moreover, having a part-time job is one of the best ways to enhance skills, get more experience in many aspects or attach, reach some new fields that they have never tried before. A job can create a huge resource of motivation for university students to be more independent, have the path to connect with the community and get quality relationship opportunities. 

On the other hand, college students will get a lot of obstacles in time management because of the overwhelming order of the daily calendar. From that point, the learning results can be decreased and affected seriously in the studying process. None of these, they can get more trapped in the society, where they did not have many experiments to solve problem situations. It means some bad people can use this weakness of college students to rob money or do something for their own benefits. 

In conclusion, this problem is a two-edged sword for society nowaday. From my perspective, I think college students should spend more time focusing on studying at school for the first time, not rush in the process of making money, and prepare for themselves a foundation of knowledge and experiences before going outside to join the workforce market.
