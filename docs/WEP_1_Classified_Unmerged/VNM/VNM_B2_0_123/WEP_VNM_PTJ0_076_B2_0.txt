"It is said that a part-time job is important for college students. In my opinion, I strongly agree with this statement. 

On the one hand, having a part-time job increases students' experiences. By taking part in jobs related to their majors, students can have chances to study and practice enough before having jobs after colleges and universities. Secondly, working with people outside colleges and universities may give them a chance to know how society in reality, so they could be mature day by day and ready to walk in to devastated working space in the future. Thirdly, students are not going to waste money which is earned by themselves and they know the value of money. Besides, they can use their own money without asking their parents and sometimes that money helps them pay tuition and fees. 

On the other hand, students should not always focus on working part-time jobs if their scores at school are getting lower. Studying is the most important thing to do when students are in college or university, so having part-time jobs should be a fun experience to learn and practice. 

In conclusion, having a part-time job is important for students to learn new things, but they should do it to gain more skills and experiences."
