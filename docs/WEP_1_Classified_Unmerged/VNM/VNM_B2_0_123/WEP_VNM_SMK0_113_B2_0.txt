"It is suggested that restaurants should forbid any kind of smoking as it is harmful to other guests and affect the eating experience. However, not only I slightly support the suggestion, but also believe that there are more practical solutions to smoking rather than just ban smoking completely.

Beginning with customers' experience, it is not pleasure for anyone to be inhaling smoke from smoker while enjoying their meal. Not to mention the effects on health of non-smokers might get when indirectly inhale the smoke, causing some lung diseases, it also degrades the eating experience of the customers when they can not fully taste and smell their food. Consequently, restaurants might get some bad impression, or simply not getting the desired commend that they have been serving for. Therefore, by forbidding smoking, restaurants are guaranteed to indirectly enhance their serving quality.

On the other hand, it is not always necessary to completely ban smoking. Restaurants can organize smoking areas allowing people to smoke without disturbing other customers. Moreover, this will potentially leave a good impression on guests' experiences, from non-smokers to smokers, as the restaurants can satisfy their guests' demand. Another alternative is to divide restaurants into sections that allow and do not allow smoking, with air filters applied to both sections. This way, customers can be pleased whether they desire to smoke while eating or not.

To conclude, banning smoking is a solution, but not necessarily the most optimal one for restaurants, as there are many other ways which ensure restaurants to make their best revenue and provide customers the finest experience."
