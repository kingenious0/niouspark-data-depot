"Part-time jobs are believed to be an essential part for college students since they allow students to make some money supporting their daily expenses. However, as there are numerous ways for students to develop themselves during college, I strongly disagree with the previous statement.

To begin with, anyone having the opportunity to study at a college should not be learning solely from classes themselves, but rather, they should perceive university as a period of time in which they get access to many other perspectives, study materials and most importantly, opportunities. Therefore, if one's desire is self-development, there will be countless possibilities rather than taking a part-time job. Often, part-time jobs are irrelevant to the major of most of the students, which indicates that they might only spend time to exchange for money, and do not gain any valuable experience for their future career. As for alternatives, students can join a club, participate in scientific research, or simply work on their own project which will garuantee to improve not only their academic level, but also enhance their relationships with other peers.

Moreover, if one's purpose is to make some money to cover some expenses, it will be much more optimal for them to aim for scholarships or conduct projects that are within the school's preference. The majority of part-time jobs do not provide as much money for students, consequently, they end up only making enough for few expenses. While the scholarships, in the other hand, can potentially provide them not only school fees, but also other expenses if they apply for many more.

In conclusion, taking a part-time job can be a way for students to make some money, it is definitely not the most optimal way to improve themselves nor marginally covering expenses."
