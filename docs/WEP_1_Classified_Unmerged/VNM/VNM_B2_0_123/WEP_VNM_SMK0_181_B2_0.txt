 don't and never try smoking. I have learned and know that it is bad, bad for my body and also for people around me. Actually, I never have a thought to try them so on this topic, I hope that ‘Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country’ but for well, it can't be. Because I know many people depend on smoking to keep their minds clear. Like my father, I, my family and he knows that smoking is not good for his health, but I can't ban it. He hears my advice, but his life is so hard, and so does he. He is looking for something to keep his mind clear, and he smoked, always. In public places like restaurants, I see that all of them have smoking places, which are far from living places. So I think the Management Board also knows that people who smoke, not just a 10, or 100, it is a thousand, and many of them are valuable customers. In my opinion, the ban is not easy and something bad still exists. So I disagree with this Topic, something people want to disappear, the things just exist and they will always think about it. Smoking in my view is bad, but in my dad's view, that is the only thing that can keep him moving, and help him a lot in relieve stress.
