"Nowadays, more and more people are smoking in restaurants causing air pollution that harms people. Some people think that we should put up no-smoking signs in large restaurants to prohibit smoking from happening to harm people. Personally, i strongly agree with this problem. 
Firstly, non-smokers such as women, children, the elderly in restaurants will inhale secondhand smoke, which can lead to serious health problems such as respiratory problems, heart disease and cancer worse, cause fainting.  So, we should be completely banned at restaurant to warned smokers to stay away from this area because they are the subject of frequent restaurant visits. 
Secondly, smoking has an even more serious risk, which is to cause a high rate of restaurant fires. Some people who do not realize that after smoking will throw it away without extinguishing the fire and throw it around, causing a fire. This has happened in many places, if we are not vigilant, it will be very dangerous for many lives. 
Additionally, we should not only use a measure to issue warning signs, but we must propagate this more through other social media such as Facebook, Tiktok about the harmful effects of tobacco in the public, especially large restaurants. 
In conclusion, the benefits of banning smoking in restaurants are essential to enhance the benefits. It also helps society develop more and more if we have a common sense of preserving the harmful effects of smoking"
