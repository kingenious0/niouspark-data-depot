"In these days and age, smoking rate is increasing in a fast pace. Smoking occurs not only in the community, in house but also in the restaurants. From my perspective, I totally agree that banning smoking at all the restaurants in the nation because of some reasons. 
	
First of all, restaurants are a common destination for people to have meals and enjoy their life.  Smoking in such a public place like that can bring several harmful diseases for people such as lung cancer, cough and sick. For example, if at that restaurant has babies, they are able to feel unwell because they have to breathe the toxic fume and they can easily cry all the time,  which makes the space be full of noise. 
	
The second reason is that smoking can make the environment be more and more polluted. Smokers tend to waste the cigarettes on the floor or waste them wherever they want. It is clear to see that this can make the beauty of the restaurant decrease. Therefore, all the restaurants should ban smoking for a better society.
	
To sum up, I am totally in agreement with the statement that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the nation."
