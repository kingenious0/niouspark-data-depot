"Many people argue that if it is necessary for countries to ban smoking at the public place as restaurants. In my opinion, smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country. There are some reasons for this.

First, smoking is very harmful for peopleâ€™s health. Not only the smoker gets sick, but the people around them also breathe the smoke. Many people go to restaurants to enjoy their food and relax. If someone smokes near them, they can feel uncomfortable and even angry. Some people have kids or old people with them, so smoking is very dangerous.

Second, banning smoking can help make the place cleaner. Smoking makes the air smell bad and there will be ash or cigarette butts on the ground. Restaurants need to be clean and fresh so customers want to come again.

Finally, smoking is not a good habit and should not be allowed in public areas. If people want to smoke, they can go outside or to another place. Restaurants are for everyone, so we need to make sure it is a comfortable place for all.

In conclusion, smoking should not be allowed in any restaurant. It is bad for health, makes the place dirty, and is not polite to others. "
