"In my opinion, smoking should be perfectly prohibited at all the restaurants around the country. Such a policy would brings numerous positive benefits from health, environment, society for both customers and restaurants’ staff.
First and foremost, a non-smoking environment protects public health. Scientific studies have shown that smoking is not only harmful to smokers’ health, but also is extremely destructive to secondhand smokers, increasing their risk of respiratory diseases, heart problems and even cancer. When people dine out, all expect to enjoy meals in a fresh and clean restaurant, not to be exposed to harmful substances.
Secondly, banning smoking in restaurants creates more pleasant dining experience of customers. The smell of smoke can easily ruin the taste of food and make the atmosphere uncomfortable, especially for families with children, the elderly and the pregnant women. A totally smoking’s ban would ensure that everyone can enjoy their meals without any disturbances. Banning smoking not only protects customers’ health but also make sure the well-being of thousands of workers in restaurants.
In conclusion, I strongly support a complete ban on smoking in all restaurants. It is a necessary step to protect public health, ensure a better dining environment, safeguard workers, and encourage healthier living for everyone.
