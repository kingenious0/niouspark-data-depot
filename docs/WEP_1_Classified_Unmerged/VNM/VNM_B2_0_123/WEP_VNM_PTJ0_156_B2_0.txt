"I strongly agree with the notion that college students should have a part- time job. Not only does a part-time job provide for extra sources of income for a college students, but it also provide an opportunity for the college students to gain certain valuable life skills that would contribute to both their personal growth and their career growth. 
First, a part-time job provide an additional form of income. College life comes with various expenses for instance: Food, transportation, social activites etc.. A complete financial reliance on family's support and scholarships is not feasiable for most college students. A part-time job while not necessarily give the college students completely financial independece, it would aids said students to be more finanically independent.  
Second, Part-time works would force the college students to develop crucial soft skills such as time management, communication and teamwork. These skills will come as a consequence of having to manage their part -time job as well as their often challenging college studies. These skills are invaluable and are highly sought after by  employers, and students who have prior part-time work experience oftens time find it easier to transition into full-time jobs after graduation.
Third, Part-time works especially to those related to the major of said college students, can help students explore career interests. For instance, a law student interested in arbitration may work at arbitration center, gaining exposure to arbitration and further enhancing their career prospect within arbitration. 
In conclusion, a part-time job is not merely a side hustle to gain an extra bit of cash; it is an opportunity for a college student to develop their skills and career prospects ."
