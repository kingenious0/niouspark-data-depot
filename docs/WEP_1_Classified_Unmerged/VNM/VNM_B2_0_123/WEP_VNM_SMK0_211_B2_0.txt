"It is suggested that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Personally, I strongly agree that a nationwide ban on smoking in restaurants is necessary because of its benefits. 
First, smoking is a bad habit as it is harmful for health. Therefore, smoking restrictions in restaurants are one of the ways to protect customersâ€™ health. Secondhand smoke causes severe respiratory diseases and even cancer in non-smokers. This is especially true in restaurants with poor ventilation, where tobacco smoke becomes trapped and concentrated, significantly worsening its health impacts.
Second, smoke lingers on furniture and food that create unpleasant dining experiences for customers. When people go to restaurants, they expect to enjoy their meals, not to inhale harmful smoke. Cigarette smoke clings to doors, seats, and tablecloths, creating an unpleasant odor even after smokers have left. For example, many diners complain that even though they are sitting in a non-smoking area, they still smell the scent from the sofa or walls.
Finally, banning smoking in restaurants aligns with global trends and social responsibility. Many countries have already adopted strict anti-smoking laws in public areas, including restaurants, as a reflection of modern public health standards. It sends a strong message that the country values the well-being of its citizens and promotes healthy lifestyles.
In conclusion, smoking should be entirely banned at all restaurants in the country to protect health, improve the dining experience, and show commitment to progressive and responsible public policies. A smoke-free dining culture is not only beneficial but also necessary for a healthier and more respectful society."
