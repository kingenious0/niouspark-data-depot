"The argument of banning smoking at all restaurants has sparked a controversy around the world. In my opinion, I strongly agree to completely stop all the activities which are related to smoking in public places. This essay will provide some reasons to support this viewpoint. 

Smoking can harm one's health because there are thousands of toxic chemicals in the ingredients of any type of smoke or cigarettes. If innocent people absorb fumes, they can struggle with many health problems such as lung cancer or respiratory issues. Restaurant is a public place where many people come and eat food, therefore it is essential to ban smoking completely at this place to protect community health.

Another reason for this view is that the awful smell and fumes from smoking is absolutely a nightmare for customers who come to the restaurant. This is because it can ruin customer experience when they enjoy the food. The delicious taste and fragrance will be completely destroyed when someone is smoking nearby. Therefore restaurants should consider banning smoking or at least separate smoking areas from the place for other people including children if they do not want to lose more customers.
 
In conclusion, from my perspective, it is a must to stop all the smoking related activities at public places especially the restaurants with an aim to protect the general health of the community and improve the experience of customers toward the restaurant. "
