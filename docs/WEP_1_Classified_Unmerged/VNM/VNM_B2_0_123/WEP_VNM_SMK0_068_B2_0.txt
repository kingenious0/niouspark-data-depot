"It is widely believed that the government should prohibit smoking in all restaurants in the country. From my point of view, I totally support this idea for citizens' health and money saving.

Some people hold the belief that smoking should be freely conducted for private demand and interest because of these reasons. First of all, smoking is harmful but they smoke in another place in order not not affect others and their family. Next, smoking is supposed to be a useful way for releasing stress in daily life. Smokers almost use cigarettes whenever they feel empty and stressed so it helps them remarkably in boosting their mood.

However, I think smokers should stop using cigars for health safety. Cigarettes contain nicotine which is a super harmful substance for people's lung and heart. Therefore, if smokers stop using them, they will definitely improve their health. Another reason is that money used for smoking is not only wasting but also meaningless. They can take advantage of this budget for doing another meaningful activity such as studying, exploring novel knowledge.

To conclude, smoking is detrimental to people's health in all aspects so citizens should not use cigarettes for releasing stress and doing another activity to benefit themselves."
