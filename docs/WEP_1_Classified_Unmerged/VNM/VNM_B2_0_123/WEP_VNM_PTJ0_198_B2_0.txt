Moreover, having a job can help people develop themselves personally and professionally. Some students can find part-time jobs that relating to their major, so that they can useful practical experiences and develop their knowledge and skills. Unless they can find a related job, students can still gain soft skills during their working time, for instance time management skill, problem-solving skill, strong team-work skill.
