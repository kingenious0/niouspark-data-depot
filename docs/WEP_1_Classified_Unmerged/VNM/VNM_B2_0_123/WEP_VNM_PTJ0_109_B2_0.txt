"In this modern life, earning money accidentally becomes main purpose in most families. Therefore, some college students try to get some part-time job besides their education journey in order to help their parents. There are some opinions that it is important to do part-time jobs during college students' studying time, however, I strongly disagree with their own thoughts because of the importance of education and ineffective time management.
 
Firstly, accumulating knowledge in this competitive world is strongly more important. Living in the world with improvements of technology, digital work, etc., people, especially young people are required different knowledge from many aspects. Therefore, studying effectively and hardworking in college is the first step in achievements of good job journey. Secondly, having part-time job without effective time management may lead to the bad health of college students. In some cases, earning the first own money brings many happiness for students and it encourages them to continue working. Therefore, students may fill full their free time for doing part-time and do not spend time studying or taking care of their health and family. Some students cannot have enough time just to sleep and refresh their mind to gain new interesting knowledge.

On the other hand, college students also gain new skills, such as communication, problem solving, etc. through their working. These skills are also important in all their life.

In conclusion, I believe that it is not important to do part-time jobs during studying time at college. Their healthcare and new knowledge should be more noticeable. Besides, students could still improve well with part-time jobs if they had good skills in management and part-time job should be found after they adapted with styles of teaching or studying in college."
