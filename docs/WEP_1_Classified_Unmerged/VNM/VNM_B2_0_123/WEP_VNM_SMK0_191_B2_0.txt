In the most ideal scenarios, I wholeheartedly agree that the complete prohibition of smoking at all the restaurants in the country should be implemented. Because such a policy can have a positive impact on people’s health, in general. In fact, passive smokers are the ones who bear the most negative consequences of smoking, not direct smokers. Smoking can also lead its smokers not being alert enough. There has been some cases that unalert smokers do immoral things and hurt their family members. That’s why banning smoking can directly protect these groups of people from being hurted. Smoking should be banned; however, I think it is unlikely to happen in the real world. The most prominent reason is that this can affect the right of freedom of many people. Government can not just prevent its citizens from doing something or sacrificing something they love for the sake of others. It may be unfair, I believe. Therefore, I think that another effective solution should be taken into consideration. There should be “special” areas in restaurants and also public places for these addictive smokers to smoke. This remedy can ensure the right of freedom of all citizens as well as the health of other people to be protected from toxic substances released from cigarettes.
