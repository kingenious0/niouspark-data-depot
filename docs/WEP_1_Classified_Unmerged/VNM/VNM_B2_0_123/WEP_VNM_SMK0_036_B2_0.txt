"It is argued that the acts of indoor smoking, especially in restaurants, should be prohibited nationwide. I stand by this proposal completely providing how its benefits outweigh any drawbacks.
Regarding the practice’s setbacks, both restaurants and smokers may experience certain losses. For the former, banning all customers who smoke can have their revenue plummeted. The decrease in profits comes not only from the smokers banned but the families and friends associated with them as well, since a meal is often a social event. In regard to the latter, being denied services at all diners for smoking robs smokers of their freedom to enjoy their daily dose of cigarettes.
On the contrary, the aforementioned disadvantages can often be overshadowed by the following gains. Firstly, by creating and committing to a smoke-free eating experience, restaurants can attract those who find smoking unbearable. Secondly, smoking has detrimental effects either actively or passively. Therefore, by banning indoor smoking at restaurants, customers can be free of the worries of consuming smoke against their will. Lastly, the fact that their habits create problems for both themselves and those around them can drive smokers towards quitting smoking for good.
All in all, while smoking appears to be an inseparable part of a happy meal, prohibiting smokers from all restaurants in the nation is favorable for both smokers and non-smokers.
