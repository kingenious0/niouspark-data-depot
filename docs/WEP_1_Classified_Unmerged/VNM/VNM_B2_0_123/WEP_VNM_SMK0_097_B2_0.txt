"Smoking has been a universal phenomenon for many centuries. Many arguments about this problem have been mentioned with 2 different directions, including approval and disagreement about some prohibited laws for smoking. The question regularly for these is "Should the government ban smoking completely at all the restaurants in the country?". In my point of view, I firmly support the ban for smoking globally, not only at the restaurants in the country, and there are some reasons for this.

First and foremost, there is no denying that the smoke is really hazardous. For the direct person using this every day, this is a reason for a lot of disease for lung, heart and affected many parts of the body. especially for children and women, who even do not smoke. A lot of researchers have proven that there are many deaths per year because of smoking. 

Moreover, especially for children and women, who even do not smoke, smoking is very harmful for them when they breathe in the air. From that point, society has a humorous burden about many community problems from smoking. Disease affection and even the eco environment have been affected heavily. It means this weakness can drive the decrease of health quality of the country, not just only in the restaurants. 

In conclusion, from my perspective, I claim that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, more globally. "
