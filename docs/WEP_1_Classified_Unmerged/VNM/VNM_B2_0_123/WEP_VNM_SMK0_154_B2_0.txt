"I partly agree that smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants. As someone who enjoys going out to eat with friends and family, I believe that a clean, smoke-free environment makes the experience much more comfortable and enjoyable. The smell of smoke can ruin the taste of food and make people feel uneasy, especially non-smokers or children.

Health is also a major concern. Even if someone doesnâ€™t smoke, breathing in secondhand smoke can still harm their lungs and increase their risk of disease. Restaurants are public places where people of all ages gather. Everyone has the right to enjoy their meals without being exposed to harmful substances in the air.

That said, I also understand that smoking is a personal habit for many people. Instead of a complete ban, maybe restaurants could offer separate, outdoor smoking areas far from the main dining space. This would allow smokers to have their space while still protecting others.

In the end, I support the idea of smoke-free restaurants, but I also believe in finding a solution that respects both public health and individual freedom. A balanced approach would make dining out more pleasant and safer for everyone."
