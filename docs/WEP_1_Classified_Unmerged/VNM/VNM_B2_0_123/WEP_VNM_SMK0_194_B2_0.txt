"These days, many people enjoy going to restaurants with family or friends. They want to eat good food in a clean and comfortable place. However, smoking inside restaurants can make this experience worse. That is why I believe smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants. There are three main reasons.
First, smoking is dangerous for health. It can cause cancer and many other diseases. Not only smokers get sick, but also people near them. This is called secondhand smoke. In a restaurant, many people eat together, so secondhand smoke is very bad.
Second, the smell of smoke is not good. When someone smokes, the smell goes everywhere. It stays on clothes, tables, and food. This makes the restaurant less clean and less comfortable.
Third, many people do not like smoking. Families with children or old people want a clean and fresh place to eat. If restaurants allow smoking, they may lose customers.
Some people may say smokers have rights. But I think public health is more important. People can smoke outside if they want, but not inside the restaurant.
In short, banning smoking in restaurants is a good idea. It helps protect peopleâ€™s health and makes restaurants better for everyone
