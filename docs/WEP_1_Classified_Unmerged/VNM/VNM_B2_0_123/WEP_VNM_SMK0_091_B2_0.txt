"Smoking in public places has been a controversial issue for years. While some argue that people have the right to smoke wherever they choose, others believe that smoking in restaurants should be completely banned due to the harmful effects. I strongly agree that smoking should not be allowed in restaurants because it poses serious health risks and sometimes affects restaurant staff.

First, smoking in restaurants endangers public health. Smoking is always known to cause various health problems including respiratory issues, heart disease and even cancer. Non-smokers, including children and elderly, should not be forced to inhale the toxic smells while eating. The only way to address this matter is a complete ban on smoking in restaurants which would protect customers and workers from these risks.

Additionally, allowing smoking in restaurants negatively impacts the dining experience. The stinks smell of smoke can be overwhelming and annoying, making it difficult for customers to enjoy their time. Many people go to restaurant for a relaxing and enjoyable time. A smoke-free environment would create a cleaner and more comfortable atmosphere for everyone. 

Moreover, smoking in restaurants affects the well-being of the staff. Waiters, chefs and other employees work long hours and are constantly exposed to smoke if smoking is permitted. This long-term exposure can lead to serious health problems. Therefore, banning smoking completely, restaurants can ensure a healthier workplace for restaurant staff.

In conclusion, I completely agree that the government should enforce strict regulations to eliminate smoking in all dining places because of all these unhealthy reasons. "
