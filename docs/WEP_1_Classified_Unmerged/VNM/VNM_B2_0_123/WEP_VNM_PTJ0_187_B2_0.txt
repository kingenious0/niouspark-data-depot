"Many people assume that college students have to gain as much experience as they can through part-time jobs. Others think that part-time jobs are a waste of time. In my point of view, as a student, I prefer taking a part-time job for some reasons.

First, it is necessary for students to have real-world skills. Although part-time work doesn’t relate to their major, it still helps them in some ways. When experiencing early, they have chances to meet others, learn how the world actually works, and improve communication skills. They will not be shy or scared of these situations in the future. I knew a lot of friends that had worked early in the first year of university, and they had the energy that nobody could.

Second, doing various work at the same time will improve their time management skills. They have to study and work at the same time. Somebody will say that is not good for students who want an excellent GPA. Otherwise, working experience has lots of benefits that could make them more mature. After graduation, they will have to face many pressure situations. Not only working, but they have to learn how to treat, communicate, and connect relationships also. Some people work and study for a Master’s at the same time. Therefore, there is no reason for not having work at present.

In conclusion, having a part-time job is a great opportunity for students. Not only improving their real-world skills but also the soft skill of management. At university period, they could have treasured time to make the best memories if they dare to live, to try, and to do."
