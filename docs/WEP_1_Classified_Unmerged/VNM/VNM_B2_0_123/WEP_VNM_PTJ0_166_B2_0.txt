"In today’s fast-paced and competitive world, many people argue that students should focus solely on their studies. However, I strongly believe that having a part-time job during college period is not only beneficial but also essential for students’ personal and their professional development.
First of all, part-time jobs offers students the opportunity to develop helpful soft skills such as time management skill, communication skill, teamwork skill and so on. These skills are rarely taught in universities but are highly valued in the labour market. When they have part-time jobs, students have a chance to learn how to balance their work and study. It requires careful planning and prioritizing, which helps students become more organized and responsible. By working part-time, students can better prepare themselves for their future professional careers and build a strong resume, giving them more potential furute job opportunities.
Furthermore, having part-time jobs also helps students become more financially independent, ease financial burden for themselves and their family by providing extra income to cover tuition fees, living expenses, saving as well. This also brings benefit throughout their lives. 
In conclusion, while academic performance should always be a priority, I firmly believe that part-time jobs play a crucial role in helping college students grow both personally and professionally. The valuable experience, financial benefits, and life skills gained from part-time work can significantly contribute to their overall success in the future."
