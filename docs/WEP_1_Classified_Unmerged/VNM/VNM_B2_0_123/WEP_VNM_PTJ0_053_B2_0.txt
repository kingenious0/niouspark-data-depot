"It is said that there are many college students who have part-time jobs, and for many reasons, this will either be a problem or just a regular thing. There are some arguments about this scenario, some support the idea that college students should have a part-time job and some do not. In my perspective, having a part-time job depends on many factors, and undergraduate students will decide whether or not they have a part-time job.

On the one hand, there are several reasons why students work part-time during their time in college. Some students have poor backgrounds, their families cannot handle all the school fees, they have no choice but to work part-time to help their families. Usually, international students are more likely to have part-time jobs than native students, they live far from their hometowns and mostly their parents have to work hard for them to study in another country. Furthermore, many students want to gain experience for their future career, it is thought that those job experiences will help them develop their skills and get more opportunities.

On the other hand, there are some opinions that do not support the idea of college students having part-time jobs. When students commit to a job, it will be easy to get distracted from their school work. There are some cases when college students too focus on finding money, they spend time working and cannot keep a balance between work and study. The problem is they do not know how to manage their time effectively so they end up messing up things.

In conclusion, I personally believe undergraduate students can have a part-time job if they can manage their time balance between work and study.
