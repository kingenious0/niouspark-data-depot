"I think it’s important for college students to have a part-time job. It help them in many ways. First, they can learn how to spend time better. When a student work and study at the same time, they must know how to manage everything. It’s not easy but they will learn slowly.
Also, doing part-time job help students to get experience. In school, we only study from books. But when working outside, we meet real people and learn many new things. Like, if someone work in coffee shop, they know how to serve customer and be friendly.
Another reason is money, not all students have much money. If they work, they can buy things they need by themself and not ask parents too much. It make them feel more independent and proud.
However, some students maybe cannot focus on study if work too much. But I think if they know how to control, it’s still good to have a job. In the end, I believe students should try to have a part-time job because it’s useful and teach them many things for life."
