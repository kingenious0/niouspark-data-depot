"Working part-time is considered to bring several drawbacks to students who pursue their college education. Nevertheless, I strongly agree with the statement that having a part-time job in colleges is vital for students due to these following benefits which are over its disadvantages.
Firstly, the fundamental advantage that college students can have during part time job is the opportunity to learn multiple skills. Apparently, academic knowledge is not enough to prepare for a future career, so some essential skills such as soft or communication skills are a must for university learners. Doing a part-time job in different fields, for example, can teaches studentd different time-management skills to keep balance between work and study and complete every task under pressure. These real-time work experiences that you cannot find in school lectures are truly precious.
Secondly, college students can earn extra money by working part-time. Obviously, the cash gained from these jobs can not only afford the students’ daily needs but also help to lessen their family’s financial burden with education expenses. For example, if the income of a college student from a part-time job is around two to  million dong per month, their parents will feel relief because the expenditure is now reduced.
In conclusion, despite some drawbacks of doing part-time jobs such as being distracted from schoolwork or facing health problems, I still believe that college students should work part-time because the experiences brought will absolutely be beneficial to their future careers "
