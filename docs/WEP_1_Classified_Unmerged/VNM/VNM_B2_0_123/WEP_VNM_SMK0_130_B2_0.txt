"I think smoking should be ban in all restaurant in the country. Smoking is bad for health. Not only for people who smoke, but also for other people near them. In restaurant, many people want to eat and relax. If someone smoking, the air become smell bad and it is not good for eat.
Also, many family go out to eat with childrens. Smoking near kids is very bad. It can make them sick. Even if you don't smoke, you still breath the smoke from other people. This is not fair. People should not be force to smell smoke when they go restaurant. If smoking is not allow in restaurant, more people will like to go there. The place will be more clean and fresh. Smoker can go outside if they want to smoke. It not hard to do that. Some country already ban smoking in public place and it works good. Some people maybe say itâ€™s their right to smoke, but other people have right to clean air too. In public place, health of many people is more importent than one person.
So, I agree that smoking should be completely ban in every restaurant. It is better for health, for family, and for everyone."
