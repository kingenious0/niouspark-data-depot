"Smoking should be punished at all restaurants in the country. In my opinion, I totally agree with this statement.
Smoking is not a healthy activity for the users and surroundings. Smoke from cigarettes is harmful and can cause several serious diseases, including respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, cancer and so on. Moreover, non-smoking people, including children, pregnant women and restaurant staff, can be affected badly to their health as well. Due to several health risks, restaurants should set up the rules or do some action to prevent and protect vulnerable customers who do not smoke.
On the one hand, being banned smoking in the restaurants can cut cost for the owner. Because when somebody smokes, they create ash, smoke residue, cigarette butts which can make the restaurant very dirty if the staff does not clean regularly. The staff needs to work harder to keep the restaurant clean and the owner needs to pay more wages. That leads the expense increase a lot. Furthermore, smoking bans can make the place safer because cigarettes can catch fire to most of the objects in the basic restaurants, such as napkins, curtains, paper for ordering. It is very dangerous for employers, employees and other people.
In conclusion, I think smoking can have a lot of bad impacts and should be banned in all countries throughout the world. "
