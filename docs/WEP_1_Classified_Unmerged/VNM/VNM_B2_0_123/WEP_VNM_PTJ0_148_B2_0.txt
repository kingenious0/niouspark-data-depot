First, I agree with this opinion. I think it is good idea for college student to have part time job. As a college students, they may face financial difficulties in paying their fee, covering their bill, so when they have a part time job, they can earn some money for pay their need like food, clothes, or even books for study. Many student now don’t come from rich family, so they need help themself. It make them more independent and don’t need to ask money from parent all the time.Also, when student have job, they can learn more skill like communicate with other people, be on time, and work hard. It help them prepare for future when they graduate and find full time job. Sometime, part time job can give them experience in the major they study, like a student study marketing can work in a shop and learn about customer. However, I think student should not work too much hour, because they still need time for study and do homework. If work too much, maybe they feel tired because of long time hour working and so on cannot focus in class. This can affect their study and their future. So it important to keep it balance between work and school.In conclusion, I agree that college student should have part time job, but only if they can manage their time good. It help them grow up and learn many thing important in life
