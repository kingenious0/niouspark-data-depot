"I completely agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants. While some may argue that smokers have the right to smoke, the health and comfort of the general public should come first, especially in shared spaces like restaurants.

Firstly, smoking in restaurants exposes non-smokers, including children and elderly people, to secondhand smoke. This is harmful and can lead to serious health problems such as asthma, lung disease, or even cancer. Everyone has the right to enjoy a meal in a clean and healthy environment without being forced to breathe in toxic smoke.

Secondly, the smell of cigarette smoke can ruin the dining experience for many people. Food and smoke donâ€™t go well together. Even if restaurants have smoking and non-smoking sections, the smoke often spreads and affects everyone. A complete ban would ensure a more pleasant atmosphere for all customers.

Moreover, restaurant staff should also be protected. Many workers spend long hours in these environments, and being constantly exposed to smoke is unfair and unsafe. A smoking ban would help protect their health and well-being.

In conclusion, smoking in restaurants poses health risks, creates discomfort, and affects both customers and employees. For the sake of public health and a better dining experience, it makes sense to ban smoking completely in all restaurants."
