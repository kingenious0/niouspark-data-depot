"It is suggested that restaurants should holistically ban people from smoking.  I completely agree with this opinion for the following reasons.

Granted, smoking should not be accepted in any restaurants due to its negative impacts. This is predicated on the fact that smoking is scientifically proven to bring detrimental impacts on people's health, not only the ones who smoke but also people staying around, suffering from this unpleasant and harmful smoke. Moreover, there is a large number of people including children and pregnant women coming to restaurants per day. If these women and kids endure from smoking for a long period of time, their health will deteriorate,  facing the risks of having serious diseases, such as lung cancer, or respiratory problems. 

Nevertheless, one might argue that smoking is people's right, thus it should be accepted regardless of place or situation. This line of reasoning, however, is flawed as it fails to take restaurants into consideration. This is is the place where people can sit back and relax, enjoy not only delicous food but also spend time with their beloved ones with peaceful and luxurious atmosphere. Having smoke in this area will definitely ruin the experience of the customers due to its unpleasant smell and the fear of the mentioned health drawbacks. If restaurants continue to allow people to freely smoke, it can discourage others to come back in the future, as well as these businesses will gain less customers and profits, posing risks to their survival in the long run.

In conclusion, it is advised that restaurants prevent people from smoking due to its harmful and unexpected effects on not only customers' health and experience but also the restaurants' development. "
