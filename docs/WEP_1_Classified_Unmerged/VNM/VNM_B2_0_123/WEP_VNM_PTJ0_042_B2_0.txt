"Following fervent efforts during the day at a tertiary institution, for some, it is expected of students to also become employed for a few hours. In my view, work at this stage does not constitute much necessity for all but very specific types of students.
	
	The work-and-study schedule is only truly fruitful for those with jobs closely related to their interest. It is under this condition that students can actually improve their set of skills and knowledge, rather than completing tasks haphazardly. Let us take an example between one who is studying hospitality and one of engineering. If both decide to take up a position serving customers in a convenience store, the former would be much more likely to get life-long benefits from the experience, not forget everything as they walk through the door. The reality is far from this, but as a hypothesis this would result in a work timeline better suited for the career post-graduation.

	For others, there are much better actions they can take instead of going to a part-time job. We need to acknowledge that a majority of students have had enough on their plate studying in a new school. They may take the whole day after school to fully absorb the lectures as well as finish required assignments. Were these students to shoulder employment anyway, they might not achieve average, acceptable levels in either component. Then, what about those still wishing to learn more about the industry? In reality, there are several answers, all with much less stress, including watching videos featuring desirable tasks, or partaking in sharing sessions opposite workers with seniority.
	
	To sum up, part-time professions had better accompany schoolwork only when a person is ready for them, while other people can take another different path as is appropriate.
