Smoking should be totally banned in restaurants in every country. Smoking has always been a bad habit of people, shortening the lifetime of both use and affected-by-use people. Lung cancer, throat cancer, yellow teeth is what they trade with a small joy of nicotine flow in their bloodstream. It’s quite amusing that a smoker is always screaming about “you are not smoking, you are not depressed, you won’t understand”. They are so proud that they have style in living and do not realize the side effects, maybe they do but they choose to be cool and “die young”. You have to admit that smoking is bad in any case and not just you are wasting your life but everyone around that too. Not only smoking in restaurants but in any public space smoking should be banned. You realize that smoking has always been pointed out that it’s bad but has been kept producing, because it benefits those who control the economy. But I am wondering if those smokers don't get ashamed when they smoke in a restaurant while everybody else is having a good meal.  It’s like the rudest thing a person can do. I understand that you are addicted and “need it right away” but interrupting other people's enjoyment is not acceptable. You can have it but have it when you are not with another person.
