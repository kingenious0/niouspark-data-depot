"I strongly agree with the statement as the essay shows my point of view.

First of all, restaurant is the place where people usually need to pay a high price in order to have nice dishes in a convenient space that have good smell of foods, waiters and so on. Therefore, smoking makes a bad consequence of smells to anyone who is in the restaurant. Because when people smoke in a convenient space like restaurant, bad smells from their mouths would make the other people in restaurant inconvenient and even worse when the polluted air in the restaurant have some bad chemical elements that makes diseases to all of individuals in the restaurant, especially children.

Furthermore, smoking should be banned in restaurant because not only the infected air to the people, smoking from a high-position person would lead the lower ones feel that smoking is a normal activity of high-position figures so they have to smoke if they want to be seen as a successful person. As a consequence, more people start to smoke which makes more smoking-addicted figures, leading to a society where smoking is a difficult problem to solve.

In conclusion, smoking in the restaurant should be strongly banned because of its effects to the group of people and the whole society."
