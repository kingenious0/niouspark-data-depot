"Some people suppose that it is crucial for university students to have a part-time job. Whereas, some individuals disapprove this opinion. In my viewpoint, students should have a part-time job for experiencing and gaining social knowledge and assisting parents in paying tuition fee.

On the one hand, students are not encouraged to have part-time jobs because of time-consuming. Parents almost think that studying must be on the top of priority. Instead of pursuing part-time job at the young age, they can spend on learning new things and trying their best at college to have high GPA and that usefully helps them after graduation. While doing part-time jobs can distract and directly affect their studying productivity. Besides, doing part-time jobs may have some potential risks such as being abused for doing much more than assigned

On the other hand, having part-time jobs benefits students in enhancing social skills. In working environment, they can meet people from different backgrounds and interact with new things so that they can have a deeper social knowledge which are necessary for their future career. Furthermore, it is also a good way for students to have a better quality of life. In their spare time, doing part-time jobs partly helps their parents in reducing financial burden and that money can be also used for developing themselves.

In conclusion, part-time job has both sides and it depends on the demand of each individual. But doing part-time jobs 's advantages outperform is disadvantages in many aspects."
