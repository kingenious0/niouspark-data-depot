"Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I strongly agree with this statement because smoking harms people’s health, ruins the dining atmosphere, and affects non-smokers’ rights.

Firstly, secondhand smoke is very dangerous. Even people who do not smoke can suffer from serious health problems, such as lung disease, asthma, or cancer, just by inhaling smoke from others. Restaurants are public places where many families, including children and the elderly, go to eat. Allowing smoking in these spaces puts their health at risk. A complete ban would protect both customers and restaurant staff.

Secondly, smoking creates an unpleasant environment for dining. The smell of smoke can spoil the taste of food and make others uncomfortable. People go to restaurants to relax and enjoy their meals. Smoke in the air not only affects air quality but also makes the experience less enjoyable for everyone, especially non-smokers.

Lastly, banning smoking in restaurants respects the rights of non-smokers. While smokers may claim they have the right to smoke, it should not affect other people’s well-being. In shared spaces, everyone deserves to breathe clean air. Therefore, protecting public health must come before personal habits.

In conclusion, banning smoking in all restaurants is a necessary step. It ensures a safer, healthier, and more pleasant environment for everyone. For the benefit of the majority, smoking should not be allowed in any restaurant in the country."
