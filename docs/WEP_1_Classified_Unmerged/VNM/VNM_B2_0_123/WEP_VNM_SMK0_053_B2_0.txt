"Smoking these days is popular around the world, it is normalized as thing people do in their daily life. There are some people said that smoking should be disapproved in restaurants due to their negative effects. In my perspective, I personally agree with the previous opinion because of several reasons.

On the one hand, smoking should be prohibited at all restaurants because of the consequences it has on people's health. When a person smokes, all the people around them will also smell the smoke. Cigarette smoke can passively harm human health. For instance, pregnant women can be affected the most by the smoke because their health during their pregnancy is very sensitive and it also be harmful to the baby. Moreover, smoking in restaurants can make other customers' experience not so good, they cannot focus on their dish due to the smell of the smoke and it will ruin their sense of eating.

Furthermore, smoking can threaten customers' safety due to some bad effects. It will be risky if someone smokes near the fire, especially restaurant is the place where they always use fire to cook. Also, other objects such as curtains, furniture and carpets can be easy to catch fire. By banning smoking in all restaurants, restaurants can decrease the chance of accidental fires and provide a safe environment for customers.

In conclusion, I believe smoking should be banned as its disadvantages outweigh the advantages.
