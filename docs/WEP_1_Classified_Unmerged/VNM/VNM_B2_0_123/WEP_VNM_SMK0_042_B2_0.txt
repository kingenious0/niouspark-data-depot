"Unlike schools or hospitals, there remain smoking areas in many dining establishments. Many health advocates yearn for these to be closed off permanently; however, this request is not only unreasonable but also inadvertently harmful.

	From an economic standpoint, when a smoker legally spends money to buy their own packs of cigarettes, they are contributing to a billion-dollar industry. A normal law, then, almost never puts a barricade on this for the few, but sides with the many. The restaurants themselves will certainly not randomly act against smokers, as they usually go with friends who have the same habit in order to chat while smoking, creating higher bills.
	One might support banning smoking in restaurants regardless, and at a certain point in history this has probably happened already. Nevertheless, it is human nature to look for loopholes in any situation. This can mean that people might try to sneak a cigarette into the corners of the building and create a risk of fire that would otherwise not be there. Another possibility is that they resort to doing it inside their homes, which results in more extreme passive smoking and fume-infused furniture.
	
	In conclusion, considering the current conditions, prohibiting smoking outright in restaurants is unattainable and inadvisable. A more viable alternative, perhaps, is creating a more secluded smoking area far away from those who do not wish to be negatively affected. "
