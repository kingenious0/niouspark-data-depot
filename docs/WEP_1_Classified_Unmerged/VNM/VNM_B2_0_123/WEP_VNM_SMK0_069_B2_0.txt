"Having been a hater of smoking for my whole entire life, watching people suffers from all kind of severe sickness that were caused by smoking, I truly should have strongly agreed with this statement.

But to be fair, I understand that everyone is different from each other's and I should respect their lifestyle. If smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants, it will only cause chaos. The number of smokers I find along a street alone is crazy, so there will be no meaning if we banned smoking (I don't want the smokers to cancel out all the restaurants, especially my favorite one). 

And if I disagree with the statement, it is mean that I have against my own self. Therefore, what I thought is the suitable answer is: all restaurants should have a room, or a place that only allow people to come and smoke only, so that there will be no complain from the other customers and the people who like to smoke would have their own place, feeling like they are being included. This will not only help the restaurants to be more diverse, but to be known as putting their customers experience first. 

It is better for all of us to respect each other's lifestyle, instead of banning a hobby of someone."
