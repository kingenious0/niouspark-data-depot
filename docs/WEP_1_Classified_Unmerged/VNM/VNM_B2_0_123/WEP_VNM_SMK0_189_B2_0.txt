"Whether all the restaurants should completely ban the smoking or not is a controversy topic nowadays. I totally agree that it should be ban once and for all.
First and foremost, smoking has been proven to harm people health in total from many scientific research and data number. It is one of the main reasons lead to cancer, which kills millions of lifes throughout years. Not only it damages to the people who directly smoke but it also harms to the people around who smoke it indirectly. According to news, the people smoke it indirectly could suffer worse consequences. Such as the pregnant women, the smoking could cause them miscarriage.
However, some restaurants need high selling incomes, and the smoking people are one of their customers. If the restaurants ban all the smoking, they will lose these amount of potential sales revenue. Hardly to say that all restaurants can ignore these money when their ultimate goal is to maximize profits. 
In conclusion, it is undeniable that smoking cause severely serious diseases. It should be banned at all places not only at restaurants."
