"I strongly agree with the argument that part-time jobs play a vital role in college students’ lives. The main reasons will be outlined in the following paragraph.

Based on my observations and experiences, doing a part-time job during university can provide students with many advantages. Firstly,   
university students can have real working experiences, helping them to improve their practical skills rather than just absorbing academic knowledge. For example, when working in customer service roles such as waiters or customer care, college students can learn how to communicate effectively with types of people, handle pressure, and solve problems promptly. Secondly, having working experiences, especially experiences related to their majors during university will give undergraduates a competitive edge in the job market after graduation. In Vietnam, employers tend to appreciate candidates who demonstrate strong soft skills in addition to academic achievements. Furthermore, students have to learn the way to balance between jobs and learning. Obviously, it will be highly pressured, however if they manage well, they can be more disciplined and resilient. 

Overall, part-time jobs bring numerous benefits to university students. Therefore, I strongly support the view that engaging in part-time work plays a crucial role in shaping a student’s future success."
