"The significant role of doing a part-time occupation during college time is one of the ignited debate in our modern society. In my opinion, I partly agree with this statement and I will explain the reason in this essay.
Taking the part-time job brings the college students such a plenty of advantages in their own life. The first reason is that understanding how hard to make money can help them to value their own money and manage their finance better.

Moreover, the part-time joins assist them to strengthen their soft skill in the future work. Some skills that they might learn from the career like time management, interaction with the customer etc. or maybe absorb their specialized knowledge will contribute their confident in their future work. For instance, some students choose some part-time career related to their major in university to apply their knowledge into reality workplace.
