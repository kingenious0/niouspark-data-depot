"Nowadays, should smoking be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country is a tricky question for the government to solve. As a citizen, I completely agree to set up a law to prohibit smoking in all restaurant because many following reasons. 

It’s easy to see that smoking has a big effect on our health, especially children and pregnancy. Studies have shown that passive smoking increases the risk of disability in embryos and dangerous diseases in pregnancy. Every year, there are approximately 37.000 people dead because of exposure of smoking. Besides, children and teenagers prefer to eat in restaurants and food stores. And when we are eating, the exposure of smoking becomes higher. And the second reason is that the smoke made the dishes become less tasty, it can make the customer find it harder to smell the taste or made the dish become so terrible. Or even smoking can effect to the culinary culture of a country, as a tourist I feel down mood when I encounter a man smoking in a restaurant. And the last reason is that now there are many smoking room and you can smoking without affect to others people.

To be conclusive, for many above reasons, i think banned smoke cigarette must be banned by law to protect community health and improve the environment in the restaurant.
