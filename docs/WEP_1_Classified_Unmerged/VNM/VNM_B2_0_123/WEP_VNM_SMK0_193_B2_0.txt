"Some people believe that it would be better if smoking is banned, while others think that it’s not that necessary to do so. I personally agree with the first statement. 
Smoking has been raising concern amongst the society regarding to people’s health. Not only the smoker affected to this but also the people around them who breathe the same air. There are studies indicate that people who inhale the smoke would bear the same risks as the smokers, especially children or pregnant women. Moreover, to prevent those things to happen, many places like restaurants, offices, malls,… have to spend money on building separate areas just for smokers. Furthermore, not all places have enough budget to do so and not everyone would comply to the “no smoking” rule so it’s not a thorough solution, at least not to every places. 
However, it’s still hard to completely ban cigarettes from public places like restaurants. As long as there’s a demand, there will be a supply to meet it and it’s difficult to eliminate this smoking habit for people who smoke a lot. This is why the government has already impose the excise duty on cigarettes as well as the main ingredient of them which is tobacco at a quite high rate to reduce the use of this good in the market."
