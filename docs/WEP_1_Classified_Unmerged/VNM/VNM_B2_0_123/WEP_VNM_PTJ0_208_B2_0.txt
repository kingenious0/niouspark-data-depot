Trend or “Force trend” of having a part time job today is quite interesting because society recognizes the benefits of part time jobs and always sings about it. Having a part time job nowadays is a choice for college students and they are not wrong if they choose not to . They have the right to choose between focusing 100% of the time to study or cutting some part of their time to have a part time job. Although you may think that a part time job is a way to gain more experience, you have to look into the insight. Part time jobs which college students can find are mainly in serving services, teaching or online writing,... mostly less experience for main career development. Students in Economics, Finance or Medical,... do not suit any of those easy-to-find part time job for their future career, excluding the students studying Hospitality or Teaching. My ideal for this case is that you don’t have to “have a part time job” like most students today follow. You can focus on language skill, writing skill or maybe your career skill. You don't have to have a variety of experience to get a job when you have done college. Imagine you are a Recruiter, you are finding a potential candidate for Finance assistant, will you choose a 4.0 in finance with no experience or a 2.0 in finance with part time job experience? See the point. So to wrap this up, it’s a choice not a force, you don't need to push yourself into worthless part time jobs, focus on your soft skills and your specialization.
