"It is said that every restaurant in the whole country should be strictly prohibited from smoking. From my perspective, I completely agree that it has advantages for people when cigarettes are banned in eateries due to several reasons.
Firstly, smoking has long been recognized as a significant health hazard, affecting both smokers and non-smokers. In places like restaurants, if there are a few people smoking there, the non-smokers, including children, pregnant women, and the elderly, can suffer from health issues such as respiratory infections, heart disease, and lung cancer due to exposure to secondhand smoke. Additionally, it sets a positive example for children and young adults, who may be easily tempted to start smoking if it is less visible and socially acceptable. Hence, smoking should be banned in public areas like restaurants to avoid such negative influences. 
Secondly, a smoke-free environment enhances the overall dining experience in a place like an eatery. For instance, imagine that while someone is enjoying a delicious plate of spaghetti, another is blowing cigarette smoke around, making everyone lose their appetite immediately and stop eating. This can easily become an explanation for why a complete ban on smoking would ensure that all customers, regardless of their smoking status, can enjoy their dining experience without the disturbance of cigarette smoke.
In conclusion, for the reasons I have mentioned above, I maintain that smoking should be totally prohibited in public places like restaurants for the safety of public health as well as to provide the dining experience."
