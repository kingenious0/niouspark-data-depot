"In the present, many people believe that college students should spend full time studying in order to complete their courses and get diplomas as soon as possible. However, others think that it is essential for students to apply for a part-time job while they are in their college life.

One of the main reasons behind the need for students to get a part-time job is finance. Many families have financial problems, which causes great pressure on students. Therefore, they have to apply for a part-time job so as to deal with those difficulties as well as give them more freedom to use money. Additionally, part time jobs give students more opportunities to express themselves. For instance, many college students do part time jobs in order to improve their communication skills and social relationships.

However, this point of view also has its own drawbacks. Students who do part time jobs may not have adequate time to study as college is more challenging than high schools. Therefore, they cannot perform well in study areas as well as cannot graduate. 

Overall, this viewpoint has benefits and drawbacks, students should consider carefully in order to give the right choices for their working and study life.
