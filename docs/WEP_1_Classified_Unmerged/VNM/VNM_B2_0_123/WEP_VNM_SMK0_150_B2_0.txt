"     I strongly agree that smoking must be banned in all restaurants. Everyone deserves clean air while eating.
     Health is the biggest reason. Secondhand smoke causes asthma, lung cancer, and heart disease. Non-smokers—especially kids, elderly people, or pregnant women—shouldn’t breathe dangerous chemicals because others choose to smoke.
     Comfort matters too. Smoke ruins meals: it makes food taste bad, hurts your eyes, and sticks to clothes. Most people hate smelling smoke while eating. Why should one person’s habit spoil everyone’s experience?
     Some restaurant owners fear losing business, but studies prove this wrong. Places like New York or London saw no drop in customers after bans. In fact, more families and health-conscious people go out to eat when air is clean.
     Workers also benefit. Waiters and chefs spend hours indoors. They shouldn’t risk their health just to do their jobs.
     ""Smoking sections"" don’t work. Smoke travels everywhere, and ventilation can’t stop it. Only a full ban protects everyone.
     In short, banning smoking keeps diners healthy, makes meals enjoyable, and protects workers. It’s necessary and overdue."
