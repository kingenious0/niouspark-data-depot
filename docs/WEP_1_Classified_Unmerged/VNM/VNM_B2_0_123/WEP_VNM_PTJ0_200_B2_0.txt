"In this day and age, having a side hustle while taking on a pursuit for higher education has been crucial not only for students but also many other individuals across the world to reach adulthood. However, some people would raise some concerns over the distractions part-time jobs can make. Others would argue that having a side hustle can help  teenagers with their pursuit for greater opportunities, higher standards of life they can acquire. Me personally, I would say that having something of a part-time job is truly important for college students, offering perks beyond just financial gains. 
Why do I agree to college students having a part-time job? Firstly, it can provide students with financial independence. Every year, college admission fees keep on rising and rising, which make students and parents or relatives feel overwhelmed with how much the money they will deperately need to pay for. Some students might even propose postponing their higher education pursuit to get some income streams to support their families instead, hindering their potential to reach for something better than themselves. With that being said, this is where a part-time job comes in to save the day. Having a part-time job can somewhat help them cover costs, manage their money and help acquire the ability to know the value and hard work from making a single dollar from working is. Not only that, having a part-time job can help students with their networking skills, getting along with new people, seeing the world with a different eye, expose them early to the workplace dynamics and develop interpersonal skills. It's because of the aforementioned reasons that I am in favor of students having at least a part-time job, as long as they can manage themselves well and not quit college halfway."
