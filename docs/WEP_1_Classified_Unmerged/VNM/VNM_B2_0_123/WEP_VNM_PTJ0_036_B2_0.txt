"It is believed that a part-time job is essential for university students. While a part-time occupation may pose certain challenges to academic pursuits, it is crucial for students.
On the one hand, part-time jobs can place a great burden on time management and well-being. This stems from the monetary benefits gained from working. However, students, especially those who attend university full-time, will need to sacrifice their time in class to be at work. Moreover, it requires enormous efforts to balance between having a part-time job and performing well at school, which may have detrimental effects on learners’ health.
On the other hand, students can gain significant advantages working while studying. Firstly, although previously labeled as a challenge, time management skills can also be improved for students with a part-time job. Making priorities, creating schedules, and being disciplined are ways to manage time that can be honed when one is required to juggle different occupations. Secondly, working part-time jobs allow students hands-on experiences rarely found in classroom settings. For instance, by working as a part-time teaching assistant, a pedagogical student can understand how different teaching methodologies are applied in real-life situations. In the long run, practices like these can better prepare students for occupying full-time jobs.
In conclusion, it is advised that students should consider taking up part-time jobs that match their expertise and hone their time management skills to make the most use of the return from the experiences."
