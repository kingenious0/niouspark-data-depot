I completely agree with this statement. There are some reasons for this. In my opinion, restaurants is a place for everyone not only to eat, but also to feel the deliciousness of the meal by smelling it or observe it. However, if there is someone smoking in the restaurant, the only thing that the customer can smell is the smoke but not the meal they eat, which leaves a bad feeling about the restaurant. Therefore, in order to pleased the customers, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. Besides, the left over from the cigarette may cause some unwanted accidents such as fire. It is very clear that no one wants to be the cause of any of the accidents, even the ones who smoke. Moreover, left over from the cigarette would lower the image of the restaurants in the eyes of customers. Restaurants are often designed formally, therfore, it would left a bad impression to the customers who come to the restaurant for the first time. The reasons above can indirectly affect to the profitability of the restaurants, and I am sure that no restaurants would love to lower their profitability and their restaurants’ image by the time goes. In conclusion, smoking partly affects to the feelings of the customers when they have their meal; left over from the cigarette may cause some unwanted accidents or indirectly lower the restaurants’ image and profitability.
