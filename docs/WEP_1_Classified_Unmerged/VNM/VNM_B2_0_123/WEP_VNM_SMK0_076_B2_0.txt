"It is said that smoking is recommended to be banned at all the restaurants in the country. In my opinion, I totally agree with this statement. 

First of all, smoking is the beginning of health problems. Although with some people, smoking is a good way to relax and reduce stress from work and life. But the reality is that 70% to 80% people who smoking are having lungs cancer and other lungs problems. 

Secondly, smoking in restaurants when other people are having dinner is disrespectful and impolite. Restaurants are places where many people are going there for dinner and average of them are succeed. Some guys who smoking at restaurants can create low quality atmosphere, restaurants may lose lots of customers because of that reason. 

Moreover, some families bring their kids and elders to the restaurant to have dinner when breathing through smoke are able to have health problems or even disabled when they grow up. 

In conclusion, planning to ban smoking at all restaurants in the country is a good idea to create a healthy atmosphere for people, especially kids and elderly people. It helps the country to reduce bad habits, health problems and make the country become a good place to live. "
