"Some people say that "Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country." In my view, I completely agree with this. These are some reasons why I think so.

Firstly, restaurants are public places. There are many people there also including older people and babies. Smoking causes the air unpleasure for them. Because they are very sensitive, smoking can make their health worse. Smoking also makes them breathe more difficultly and many other health problems. Therefore, smoking should be banned at all restaurants for human health.

Furthermore, people go to restaurants to desire to have delicious meals in a pleasant environment. Smoking causes unhappy feelings for individuals enjoying their meal. The employees after a long workday need time to recharge power while smoking make them more tired. Some families choose eating at restaurants to have more time talking with family members, sharing time together, and smoking is their barrier. So, I think the manager, or the owner of restaurants should set the rule no smoking.

Besides, smoking could make food worse. The food will have no original taste when having clients smoke. While the most important part of a restaurant is the quality of the food, I think we should ban smoking to make clients have better experience.

In summary, I agree with the view "Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country" for reasons that I mentioned. I also hope that all the restaurants in my country will apply this rule soon because of the healthy environment. "
