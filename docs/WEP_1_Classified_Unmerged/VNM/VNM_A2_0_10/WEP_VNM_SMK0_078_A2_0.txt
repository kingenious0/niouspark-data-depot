"Nowadays, smoking in public places, especially in restaurants, has been a controversial issue for years. Many countries have already imposed bans on smoking in indoor spaces. I agree with this statement. Smoking in public places like restaurant should be banned because of some reasons.

First of all, smoking in restaurants poses serious health risks to both smokers and non-smokers. For non-smokers including the children and older people, smoking leads to problems about the environment because it is very dangerous for many people's health when they sit near the smokers.

Secondly, banning smoking in restaurant protects the environment. The restaurant's atmosphere will become fresher and more peaceful. By prohibiting smoking, restaurants can maintain a cleaner space and attract customers. A smoking ban ensures a healthier environment for everyone in the public places.

Last but not least, banning smoking in the restaurant is very important because it not only improves their product quality but also improves the environment. I hope many countries can ban smoking in the restaurant and other public places. 

á»Šn conclusion, smoking in the restaurant is very dangerous, so we must ban smoking to protect any health for everyone and the environment. It is very useful for the present and the future."
