"In spite of hating smoking very much, I still think it is not necessary to ban smoking at every restaurant in my nation. 
Smoking is harm for people who use it and people around them, especially for pregnant. It affects their economy, in restaurants it can affect the taste and smell of other people, a biggest harm everyone can see is problem about lung and health. Governments did a lot of thing to reduce amount of smoking-person, such as rising fax, but they never strictly ban it. First, it can be difficult for them because there is not everyone smoking can give up this, it will be not comfortable when they can not use it for a long time. Using smoke is harmful, but it still brings some small benefits, like reducing stress or be warmer. Banning completely is unequally to them, like we acting with a villain. Second, the separate area for smoking is enough to them. It is good for all, they can smoke and not harm to anyone. Third, the smoking-person takes a big percent of people, banning all can make them not comfortable and so on, they do not go outside for eating and then, the annual money of restaurant can go down.
To include, we do not have to ban all smoking. Instead, we should be more sympathize and remind if some one smoke in improper place."
