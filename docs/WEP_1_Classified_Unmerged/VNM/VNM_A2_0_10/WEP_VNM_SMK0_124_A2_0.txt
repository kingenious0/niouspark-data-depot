I completely agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants nationwide for many health and social reasons. Firstly, cigarette smoke is harmful not only to smokers but also to those around them through cigarette smoke. Toxic substances in cigarette smoke can cause many dangerous diseases such as lung cancer, cardiovascular disease and respiratory problems, adversely affecting the health of smokers as well as those around them. Secondly, banning smoking will create a clean and comfortable environment for diners. Many people, especially children, pregnant women and the elderly, feel uncomfortable eating and drinking in a space where food and drinks are filled with cigarette smoke. Children or pregnant women who inhale it will be significantly affected to their health, endangering their lives. If you smoke in a flammable environment, a huge fire will occur at that time. This will not only affect human life but also seriously affect the surrounding property. Therefore, banning smoking will help people enjoy their meals without worrying about unpleasant odors or health risks. In Vietnam many restaurant are banned people smoking, leading to the incresed of cutomers. Finally, this ban also provides a healthy lifestyle, encourages people to give up smoking and build a more civilized and safer society.
