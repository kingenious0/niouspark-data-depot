"The standard become higher when coming to university, college students often choose some work which can do out of the school-time. It brings a lot of benefits for them beside money, such as communication and life experiments. But it is not a significant thing that college students have to do. 
First, the main thing for this period is studying. They need to attend full class and explore more at home to have good grade and knowledge. Some of them just work and not study, which bring a bad grade, and worse is failing this subject, so they have to use money to learn again. If we learn by heart, the result of exam will not bad, and maybe we will have a scholarship. It can cost equal or more than the salary from a small work. Second, if they can not manage time well, they will have problem about their health, especially result from lacking sleep-time. I have a friend who have a really terrible problem about stomach, a lot of blood come out from his mouth after a long time learn and work too much, and do not have time to sleep and eat on time. It always reminds me about noticing health. Without health, we can not do anything. 
To summary, I think it is not necessary to work in university life, we can find a lot of interesting thing from another place like clubs, friends, professor. So if you can choose, just enjoy this time."
