In my opinion, college students do not need to have a part-time job. Firstly, college students usually spend more time for it than studying at school. And then, the results of their subjects at school will be bad. Secondly, students do not graduate, they cannot have a job that is like their major. The knowledge they have after work cannot use for their job in the future. Thirdly, if college students concentrate in part-time jobs, the will forget their friends. And after long time, they are going to lose a lot of social relationship. Lastly, when you can earn money from your part-time jobs, you will completely focus on it and forget to study at school. And then, they are going to graduate late or they cannot graduate. That is so bad for their future. Besides that, the part-time job is also a good idea for the student if they want to have a job in their free time. There are a lot of student find their favorite job after they have a period time to do part-time job. All in all, I think the college students need to have a part-time job, but they should balance between their part-time job and their study at school.
