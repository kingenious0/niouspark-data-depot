"I have some reasons to disagree and agree with the topic do not servicing smoking at all restaurants in the country.
First, if some people are having trouble in their lungs, they can eat the outside. The restaurant can be serviced to them. Second, the finances of a restaurant can be low-down. The restaurants can collaborate with some brands to produce smoke or something like that, if we do not service something like that, we can lose a lot of money from the brands and the people using the service in the restaurant. So for all reasons, I disagree do not being serviced at all restaurants in the country.
However not serviced at all restaurants in the country is a good suggestion to improve health. If a family has some children go to the restaurant to accept smoking. Children can be coughing and snowing. Second, when teenagers see a man or woman smoking, they will do that. It is a bad mirror for teenagers. And people should not do it.
So serviced smoking at all restaurants has a lot of advantages and disadvantages. When people go to restaurants, I believe that they want to enjoy the food and background, good atmosphere, not smoking. "
