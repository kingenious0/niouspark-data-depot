In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants across the country. Restaurants are public places where people come to eat, drink, relax and chat. If smoking is allowed there, non-smokers will also have to inhale cigarette smoke, which is harmful to health. Cigarette smoke not only causes illness to smokers but is also very dangerous to people around them, especially children and the elderly. Breathing in secondhand smoke for a long time can lead to serious diseases like heart problems, or even cancer. In addition, cigarette smoke pollutes the air in restaurants, causes unpleasant odors, and makes food unappetizing. Many people feel very annoyed when they are eating while someone is smoking nearby. If smoking is completely banned, restaurants will become cleaner and more comfortable for everyone. It can also help reduce the number of people who smoke, especially young people who might copy adults. Some people may think that such a ban is a restriction on personal freedom. However, freedom should not affect the health of others. Smokers can go outside or go to a separate area to smoke. This way, everyone can enjoy their meals without worrying about smoke. In short, a complete ban on smoking in restaurants is necessary to protect public health and create a cleaner, more civilized dining environment.
