I think that is a good idea when smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, and I strongly agree with this idea. The first reason is about the heath of the human in the restaurants. Smoking is going to affect badly for the health of the people smoke and the others people in the restaurants. Specially, the smoke will strongly affect to the development of children in the restaurants. The second reason is about the view inside the restaurants. Smoke in the air cause the customers in the restaurants feel really badly. They can see the view and it leads to their experience to be badly. After that, they will give the bad comments for the manager and they aren’t going to go to this restaurant. The last reason is about inside your mouth. Some research in the world about the effect of smoke to the smell of mouth. They proved the effect from the smoke to the smell of mouth is true. Therefore, I think the restaurants can build a room for people use to smoke. Because, some people addict to smoke and they can live without smoking. All in all, I think smoking is not good and it should be banned at all the restaurants in the country.
