I think that having a part-time job is very important for students who are still in school. Part-time jobs help students earn extra income to cover living and studying expenses, reducing the financial burden on their families. This is meaningful for students from families with limited conditions or difficult circumstances, helping them to be self-reliant, independent, and earn extra money to cover their living expenses. In addition, part-time jobs also help students practice soft skills such as communication, dealing with people, time management and problem solving. These skills are essential for personal and career development in the future. Accordingly, practical work experience will help students become more confident, improve their knowledge and experience when entering the labor market after graduating from school. But for students who do not manage their time well between studying and working, their studies will be neglected and they will not be able to keep up with their progress in class. After all, part-time work is just a side job for students who want to earn extra income. Students should still focus on studying in class. Experience is also something that comes with the learning process, and when they graduate, it is also a skill that will give them priority when submitting their CV. Therefore, students need to know how to balance between studying and working effectively to avoid affecting their learning outcomes.
