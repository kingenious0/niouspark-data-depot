"Nowadays, people have a very high knowledge about health. So that, they tend to have a very serious attitude when other people do some negative effects for their health. Base on that opinion, I completely agree with the sentence: cigarettes should be seriously banned at all the restaurants in our country.
Firstly, restaurants are places where have diversity kind of people, from all generations. Children and elderly are kinds of people really easy to be hurt, and need to be protected. Definitely, smoking can destroy deeply their lung although they are not someone who directly smoke. 
Secondly, restaurants do not just sale food but they also provide some services, for example: atmosphere, music, place for eating and so on. And having the smoke of the cigarettes can make the atmosphere becomes terrible with some clients, they can have some complaints about that.
Besides, a solution for the restaurants is to have a private place for someone who smoking. It can solve problems from smoking people and also help the restaurants do not have to band their customers.  
In conclusion, we all know that smoking is something not good in society so It should be unacceptable in restaurants. Although smoking has many weaknesses but we also can have solution for it.
