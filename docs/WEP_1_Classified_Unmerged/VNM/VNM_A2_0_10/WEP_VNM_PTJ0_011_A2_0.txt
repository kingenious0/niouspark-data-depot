"College students need to have a part-time job. I believe that a part-time job is a good suggestion for me and my friends.

First of all, a part-time job is flexible for my time. I go to school in the morning and evening, so I have free time tonight. So I can use it for my part-time job. I can study at the place where I do a part-time job if I have a competition. Secondly, the money can I get are little high. Enough buying the tools serviced for my major in university, and getting some snacks. I can buy some gifts for my family and my friends. Last but not least, with the money from my part-time job, I can help my family, they do not need to send money to me every month or send it low, but at least. And a part-time job gave me some good experience at the present. I believe that it make me completely myself in the future. For example, I can meet some good people when I service them and I feel comfortable when I do it. 

So having a part-time job is a good suggestion for me a student at college."
