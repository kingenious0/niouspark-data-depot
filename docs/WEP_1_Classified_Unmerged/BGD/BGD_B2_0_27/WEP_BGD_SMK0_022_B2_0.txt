 I am strongly agree with the agreement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because of the health issue of the people.
First of all, restaurants are the public place where every age of people go for eat and drink. Smoking effects the smokers and the others also the childrens. Smoking causes cancer to the people who smokes and also the people who don't smoke but staying with the smokers. Smoking causes same health issues for both smokers and non smokers. Smoking can make the restaurants unhigenic and it can also make the environment of the restaurants unstable.
On the other hand, if the people smoke openly in the restaurants it can make the environment of the place unstable and uhigenic. The children cant be go to the restaurants if the people smoke their because smoke causes health issue to others also. Non smoker people don't go to the restaurant where people smoke openly. Nowadays people are more aware of health hazards that's why it will create a bad reputations for the restaurant. Restaurants will also lose a huge number of customer who don't smoke which will decrease their revenue.
In conclusion, Smoking should be banned in all the restaurants in the country for the sake of the people's health and safety.
