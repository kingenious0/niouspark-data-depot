 The ever-present debate about smoking in restaurants needs a blanket prohibition across Bangladesh. Several factors explain this viewpoint, including the importance of public health and consumer happiness.

To emphasize public health, a smoking ban in restaurants must be implemented. Active smokers and those exposed to secondhand smoke are at risk of developing respiratory ailments, cardiovascular difficulties, and long-term health issues. Bangladesh may preserve the well-being of restaurant guests and workers by preventing smoking, supporting healthier lifestyles, and lowering the strain on healthcare services.

A smoke-free eating atmosphere improves the overall dining experience for all customers. Nonsmokers may enjoy their meals without pain or exposure to bad scents, resulting in a welcoming environment. Restaurants in Bangladesh can provide a more sanitary environment by enacting a prohibition.

Improved air quality, lower smoking rates, and more public knowledge of the dangers of smoking are all effects of smoking bans in public areas, including restaurants. The effectiveness of these programs will illustrate the achievable goal and upside of installing a countrywide smoking prohibition in restaurants.

As a result, a complete restriction on smoking in restaurants across Bangladesh is required to preserve public wellness and improve the eating experience. Accepting a smoke-free restaurant atmosphere encourages healthier choices and demonstrates Bangladesh's dedication to its population's health.
