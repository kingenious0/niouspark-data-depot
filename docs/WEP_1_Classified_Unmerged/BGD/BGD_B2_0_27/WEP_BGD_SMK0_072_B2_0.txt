 I agree with the statement that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. 

Throughout history, mankind has been plagued with a number of vices, smoking tobacco being a fairly prominent one. Besides being a health hazard to the smoker, cigarette smoke is a threat to other people in the smoker's vicinity. Smoking in a public place, such as a restaurant is a deplorable act which endangers others. While the smoker made the conscious decision to take up smoking, the other people did not and it is unfair to subject them to passive smoking. According to a report from the World Health Organization, passive smoking is responsible for the deaths of over 600,000 people every year. This is a grave issue and should not be treated lightly.

While outright banning smoking on restaurant premises is the morally correct thing to do, from a business perspective, restaurant authorities are reluctant to do so. As it is their duty to accommodate their customers, restaurants often look the other way when patrons decide to smoke. At least creating separate smoking zones away from the main lounges should be a priority for now. A lot of newer and upscale restaurants are following this positive trend by offering dedicated smoking zones, while others have gone on to completely banning the act.

It is impractical to ban the sale of all tobacco products, as it would mean an almost trillion dollar industry would cease to exist, which would greatly affect the economy and would drastically decrease tax revenue. However, what we can do is control the environmental and health risks it poses by not tolerating smoking in public places, especially restaurants.
