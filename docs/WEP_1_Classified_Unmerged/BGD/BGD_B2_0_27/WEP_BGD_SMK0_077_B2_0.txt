 Smoking is not only harmful for the smoker, it is also injurious for the people around the smoker. There is a term which is called passive smoking, it means breathing in tobacco smoke from other people. As restaurants are the place where people of various ages and classes visit for food and enjoyment, I think smoking should be completely banned from the restaurants. 
Smoking causes various deadly diseases like cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, chronic bronchitis etc. Restaurants are open for all kind of people and if smoking is not banned then the smokers will surely smoke and it would be harmful for both the smoker and other people who are inhaling the fume passively. Passive smoking is more injurious to children and pregnant women, it will cause respiratory illness like asthma, pneumonia etc. 
Some restaurants may have separate smoking zone but it should also be banned because it will influence others to smoke. People in restaurants pay to taste good food but breathing in the smoke fume from other person can cause asthma and cough to them. A non -smoker person has the right to enjoy his food with a good environment and breathe fresh air. So, smoking should be completely banned from all the restaurants in the country.
