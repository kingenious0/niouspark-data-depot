 Smoking is undoubtedly a dangerous threat to both smokers and nonsmokers. When it comes to the threat for non-smokers, it is an important issue to discuss. Passive smoking or second hand smoking can cause more damage to the non-smokers than it does to those who smoke actively. In my point of view, smoking should be completely banned from all the restaurants in the country. 

Passive smoking mostly happens in restaurants having no restrictions on smoking. However, some restaurants in our country took the non-smokers' health into account and provided separate rooms for smoking. Though banning smoking in restaurants has been a burning question in recent times, there are people who believe that implementing a smoking ban violates freedoms and the rights of smokers. They argue that individuals should be free to make choices even if those choices have effects on their health. Additionally, some restaurant owners express worries that a smoking ban could result in decreased business as some customers may prefer restaurants where smoking is allowed

On the other hand, enforcing a ban on smoking in restaurants can motivate smokers to quit smoking or find designated areas for smoking that are separate from dining spaces. This can play a role in promoting a society and ensure a healthy life for citizens. Moreover having smoke free environments creates a welcoming atmosphere, for families and individuals who wish to enjoy their meals without being exposed to smoke

In conclusion, I think that smoking should be entirely prohibited in all restaurants across the nation. By banning smoking, we can contribute to the improvement of the nation's health and welfare.
