 

I agree with the idea of banning smoking in all restaurants. Everyone knows cigarettes are not good for health.  Smoking can cause some dangerous diseases like lung cancer, stroke, chronic bronchitis and so on. Even just the smoke of the cigarette makes a man sick.

As most of the restaurants are air conditioned, when someone smokes, the smoke spreads quite fast through the whole restaurants. A man who doesn't smoke but only breathes in the smoke of cigarettes also has a chance of getting cancer. A restaurant must be a suitable place for a family to go. A family may have children with them. We can totally understand how risky it is for a child to breath in cigarette smoke. A smoker obviously wants to relax with a cigarette and a cup of coffee in his/her favorite cafe. But they can smoke in their home or a private place without affecting others. It may cause an economic loss to some restaurant owners because some smokers may not go the restaurant after banning smoking. But the ratio of smokers and non-smokers is huge. There are many children and old people who go to restaurants. So in that term, restaurant owners can still profit from these customers. They should think about people's health more than their business. 

Obviously we can't stop someone from smoking if they don't care about their health themselves. On the other hand non-smokers have the right to breath in fresh air. Banned of smoking may cause a little loss to the owners but health should be the first concern for people.
