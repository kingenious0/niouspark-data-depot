 
I agree with the above statement since for a student, having a part-time job gives them the opportunity to explore the job life and get an exposure to the corporate life that they will most likely be embarking upon. Even though some students might opt to not go for that corporate life and thus might not benefit in that sector, it would still be my suggestion that they go for a part-time job. It will at the very least give them a learning opportunity on how to manage their expenses and can build a habit of saving their income. This will be very important regardless of what field they work in. Although there can be an argument made for the fact that a part-time job might hamper their studies and could take too much of their time and energy. If any individual feels that this might be the case for them then it is better for them to just focus on their studies. However, for those that can multitask, it would be a great opportunity in terms of the reasons mentioned above, and for a great networking opportunity. This means that there could be an opportunity to connect with someone that can be useful for future opportunities. Thus, I feel like there are sufficient reasons for a college student to have a part-time job.
