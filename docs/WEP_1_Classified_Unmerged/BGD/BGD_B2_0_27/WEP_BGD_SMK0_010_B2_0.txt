 Some people argue that smoking should be banned in restaurants. And I strongly agree with that argument.
Every new-generation restaurant has separate rooms for smokers. Smoking has become a very common part of life. And the restaurant owners played their part in normalizing smoking. In every country, a good number of people smoke on a daily basis. Smokers usually feel the real craving after lunch or dinner. So restaurants keep a smoking zone to increase their service. These days, restaurants are using fancy designs and making their smoking areas more attractive for smokers. Because of these things, teenagers might think that smoking is a cool trend to follow. Restaurant owners might not know that, but they are promoting smoking directly to their customers. It can ruin a family. Smoking should be banned in restaurants. Because not only does it attract chain smokers but also potential smokers. Smoking in restaurants can also spread a bad smell throughout the restaurant. Restaurants can be a very suffocating place to be when the bad smell spreads. It won't be good for the business as well. Taking all these into condsideration, restaurants of any nature should be smoke-free places where families can go with their children.
