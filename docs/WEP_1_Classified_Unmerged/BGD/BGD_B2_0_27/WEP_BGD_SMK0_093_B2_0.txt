 Smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. In the recent years, public smoking has become a very serious issue particularly in the restaurants. While some believe that people should be able to smoke publicly many others argue that it's a serious health concern. I strongly agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants across the country. Because its hazardous to the smokers and the non-smokers as well to smoke publicly on a restaurant.

Secondhand smoke is a serious concern for the people. Secondhand smoke means to passively smoke. I.e. when some one is smoking in public some other person around him might intake the smoke with or without knowing about it. Passive smoking is as harmful for the health as active smoking is.

There might be different types of people at a restaurant. Children, elderly, pregnant women people with lung issues etc. might be present at a restaurant. Public smoking might affect these people because they're very sensitive and fragile in nature. This is a serious health concern for the children, elderly and pregnant women.

Although in many restaurants there are some designated smoking zones, most of the restaurants don't practice this at all. But smoking zones are not the solution. Sometimes because of bad ventilation the smokes from a cigarette might still cause hamper to the environment and not always the smoking zones are actually smoke resistant.

So I think, at all the restaurants of the country smoking should completely be banned. As a restaurant is a place where all kinds of people visit, smoking should not be allowed there publicly. Or all restaurants should practice having designated smoking zones as well as they have to offer better ventilation system so that non-smokers don't have any kind of health hazard due to smoking.
