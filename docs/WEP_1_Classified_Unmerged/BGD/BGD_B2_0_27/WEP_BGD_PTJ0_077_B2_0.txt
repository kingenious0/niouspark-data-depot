 Student life is the most important period in the life of every human being. If students can utilize time effectively, they will shine in the future. So, they have to be responsible and career oriented. As student life is the seed time of life, I think every college student should engage themselves in part- time jobs. So that they can learn the proper use of time and improve their skills.
Working part- time can help a student to become more independent. If a student can manage his time between work and college, it will help him to become perseverant. There are a lot of importance of part-time jobs for a student. Working in a corporate environment will help a student to gather experience for his future career. Students get to learn about workplace ethics which will make them more confident. 
Part-time jobs will help students to manage their time properly. As they have to manage study and work together, this will strengthen their time management skills. Students will become more organized which will help them in the future. When a student starts earning, he will understand the value of hard work and will be more conscious about saving money rather than wasting it. 
College students can build up confidence and make the habit of handling multiple responsibilities through part-time jobs. It will also help them to boost their resume as most of the corporate sectors want skills and work experience from the applicants.
