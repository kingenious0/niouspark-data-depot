I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part time job. There is enough evidence to back up my claim. When a student studies in a college, it's his duty to gather knowledge and skills not only of his academic studies, but also of the non-academic ones. As a result, when a student has a part time job, he can get real life experience of what it's like to work in a professional world. By doing a part time job, a student can prepare himself to be more professional and to be an organized person. Besides, it can help a student to earn extra pocket money. It makes him careful about spending his hard-earned money. Moreover, students learn money management by having a part time job in their college life. Doing a part time job can make a student more confident about him and his future career. The realization of how difficult it is to earn money, makes a student try harder to become a successful person who earns a lot of money. So it gives him independence. Having a part time job also assists a student with different networks of people. He can get to know more people. Hence, a student can learn a lot from his network and the people around him. Lastly, I'd like to say that employers usually want to pick applicants with work experience. A part time job can give a student the experience he needs to get a full time job. So I believe, it is necessary for all college going students to have a part time job.
