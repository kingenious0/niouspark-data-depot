I disagree with this statement. Although I agree that smoking is injurious to health, I feel that individuals should be able to have a separate space for smoking. This is because individuals who smoke, would want these facilities to be there when they visit a restaurant. This not only gives them an opportunity to be comfortable in their own space, but also protects those who are non-smokers. Moreover, having this allocated space could also be a reason for these individuals to visit these restaurants. This could give the restaurant a driving force for revenue and also give them an additional opportunity to cater to this demography of the population. Although it could be an idea that not all restaurants would need to allow smoking, some, or those who chose to could do it. Banning creates a situation where people must be provided with an alternative but if it is not provided, then there could be a case where people are forced to find places to smoke in public, which are not suitable or might cause others discomfort. Lastly, banning will always lead to resistance, therefore, other policies which influence people to smoke in an area where non-smokers are not impacted, should be implemented.
