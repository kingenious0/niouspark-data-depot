 I must agree with the importance of having a part-time job in student life. Earning money from college life makes a student independent. They gain more confidence because they don't have to be depended on anyone. They are on their own. Also this teaches them responsibility. They know the value of hard working money. Also part-time job makes a student punctual. They know how to manage their time because they manage their time between college & work. Moreover their skills will be developed. In most cases we can see that a student who is successful in his/her career did part-time jobs in their college life. 
Doing part-time jobs from earlier strengthen the professional qualities. This also helps a student to choose their career. In today's world many student can't select their career in lack of proper concept. So in that case if a student has part-time job experience, they'll know which career option is best for them. Even it will strengthen their resume. Everyone wants to work with someone experienced who has a minimum knowledge of office culture. In that term, freshly graduated people face a big problem finding jobs due to a lack of proper experience on their resume. But a freshly graduated student who has past experience of job life gets a job quicker than others. They obviously have skills to show an office other than their CGPA. Besides a part time job holder learns how to socialize with others.
So in conclusion, benefits of having part-time job in college life are many. This makes a student independent, confident and mature.
