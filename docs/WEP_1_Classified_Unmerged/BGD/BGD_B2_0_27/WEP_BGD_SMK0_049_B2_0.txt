       I disagree with the proposal that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. We all know smoking is very harmful to one's health. It causes severe respiratory problems. Cigarette contains nicotine, which increases our heartbeat rate and blood pressure. In the long run, nicotine increases the possibility of heart attack. Smoking cigarette causes cancer. When a person smokes a cigarette, the smoke is exposed in the environment. As a result, people around the smoker also inhale nicotine and toxic chemicals. So, it is very unfair to the non-smokers as they are exposed to nicotine involuntarily. Therefore, public smoking should be banned.                                                  However, smoking cigarettes is a serious addiction. An addict cannot get rid of his addiction so easily. It is a long and painful process. A lot of smokers go to restaurants everyday. If smoking is banned in all the restaurants, many of those smokers might stop coming to the restaurants. We cannot be that naïve to hope that banning smoking in restaurants will cause the smokers to leave smoking. In fact, the restaurants might rather lose a lot of customers. The best possible solution to this problem is to create a separate 'Smoking zone' in the restaurants for smokers. In this way, the non-smokers will be safe from the hazards of nicotine. Rather than issuing a strict ban, chain smokers should be rehabilitated and passive smokers should be discouraged. This is the process through which I think this issue should be handled.
