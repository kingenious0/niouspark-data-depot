 I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have part-time jobs. Whether they need to support themselves or they wish to pursue other hobbies, part-time jobs are an excellent way to fund any activity while accumulating necessary skills and experiences.
According to the National Student Money Survey, over 62% of students in the UK have part-time jobs, which is a great indicator of how popular a concept it is. As most students cannot afford to work fulltime due to busy study schedules, they are often left with part-time employment as their only option. But it is a valuable and positive experience in many ways, as it not only provides the student with an auxiliary income, it also helps establish a sense of maturity and responsibility. One of the leading reasons why people pursue higher education is to achieve financial freedom. And part-time jobs offer students the opportunity to take a step in that direction by providing first-hand experience of money management and budgeting.  
While students are invested in their education, they should also engage in activities to gather professional experience, which in turn would help them become competent individuals. A part-time job is a great pathway to mastering multi-tasking, workflow management, time management, interpersonal skills, and much more. All of these qualities are imperative elements required to not only be a great professional, but also a well-rounded individual. 
Part-time employment is a great supplement to education as it directly aids students to acclimatize with real world situations and become adept at problem solving through exposure.
