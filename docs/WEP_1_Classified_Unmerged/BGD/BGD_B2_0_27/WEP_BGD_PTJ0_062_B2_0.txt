Its vital for college students to have a part-time job. In my opinion any kind of job may it be, part time or full-time job gives you a sense of financial independence and responsible mindset. Few of the advantages of having a part time job are firstly there's always benefits of starting early- you get more experience by the time you actually step in to the corporate life or start your own business, you know most of the pro and cons though there's no ending to learning. And then an essential skill we can learn is communicating and holding ourselves accountable for our own doing. Most of our childhood and adolescence passes under someone's guidance, so we are used to of someone taking care of us hence we don't feel the necessity of communicating with anyone properly. Then comes the matter of being self-aware, it's not completely agreeable but in most cases, we become self-aware only when we start earning at least that's the case with me I started earning at a very young age of 16 even if the amount was little, it was sufficient for me to make me proud of myself and knowing that I can go to the market and buy groceries and don't have to ask it from my father was a huge accomplishment for me. Moreover, I learned money management, budgeting, savings and what not in the past few years which now helps me understand bigger money problems. Lastly leaving the evident advantages out it helps us expand our social and professional network. To sum it up, it is possible to state that college students should have part time job since it improves students in every way.
