 No, I don't think smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants around the country. Smoking is a social thing done by maximum of people in Bangladesh. Smoking is common in every social class from poor to rich smoking can be found done by everyone.  

 

Restaurants are a common place for smoking. In Bangladesh almost all restaurants have smoking zones because of this reason. Banning smoking in restaurants would be a great loss for restaurant owners as some people go to restaurants to smoke, eat and socialize. Many restaurants will be shut down and will be a mess for the economy of Bangladesh.  

 

There is also the problem of pollution and littering. People who smoke in the streets usually pollute the streets with cigarette ash and bud. Due to smoking in restaurants pollution has been minimized as in restaurants one can smoke in a controlled environment where no pollution occurs. Which is healthy for the environment.  

 

Public smoking is a huge problem in Bangladesh. Due to this a lot of non-smokers are punished by passive smoke. The smoke of tobacco burning is harmful and can cause huge problems to kids in the future. Lung infection to nose block it is bad. But smoking in restaurants helps eliminate that. In this situation smokers and non-smokers both are happy.  

  
We can see from the above paragraphs how important and helpful it is to smoke in restaurants and that it shouldn't be stopped in any shape or form.
