 Yes , I agree with the opinion that for college students having a part time job is important because most of the students are grown up and self independent in this time.
The college students are almost grown up and in this time they should be work hard and think for their carrer.They should learn things and do differnts works to learn things. By doing a part time they  can see the real world or the world outside the books. They can earn money for themselves. They can even save those money as savings for their futue or use those money as pocket money. They don't need to depent on others if they do a part time job. They can be self independent in this way. They can also develop their communication skills and work experience. They can also learn how to deal with people.
On the other hand , If they don't do a part time job they become slower and they will always depent in others for money. They cant be self independent. They cant see the outer world when it's the proper time. They will face the real problems in the future when they need proper communications and skills which they can get by doing a part time job.
In the end , Every college students should do a part time job to develop their skills development, communication levels and work experience.
