  Smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country  I disagree with this statement because not everyone will be comfortable with this decision also if smoking is banned in some restaurants then it will be considerable but not all restaurants.

Smoking is a addictive habit that we all know and for some people it became a lifestyle. Some people smoke daily and some occasionally. Those who smoke daily or too often can hardly live without smoking. So they smoke at their own home, they smoke outside and also they smoke in restaurants. If a restaurant ban smoking in their place then it can have a negative impact on their business because the place will be filled with non smokers and the smokers will not go to the restaurants and the business may go down some percentage. On the other hand, if the banning smoking in all restaurants can cause a mass negative impression about this measure taken by the restaurants. This negative impression can flood social media with negative comments and posts and worst case scenario it can create a mass movement by the country people.

On the other side of the page, I do agree to ban smoking in some particular restaurants which are designed and created to be much healthier and which is also children friendly. Smoking can cause bad affects on childrens health if they often inhale the smoke passed out from a smoker. Also, the old people can have some problems in their body like asthma which can be worse if the person is near smoke. It can seriously damage their lungs and also cause other problems in their body. Hence, some particular restaurants can ban the smoking or to be fair they can introduce a separate smoking zone for the smokers.
