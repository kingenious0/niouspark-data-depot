 Smoking is the poison of choice for multitudes, that despite relentless efforts, continues to enchant more of the population. A strong case can therefore be presented to ban smoking from all the restaurants in the country. However, even though on the surface this may seem like a reasonable course of action, I believe such a measure is not necessary and can do more harm than good.

With every passing day, more of society and youth gravitate towards a contrarian lifestyle. As such, to impose such a harsh ban will not be preferred by the masses. Instead, it may lead to smoking seem more desirable and encourage fickle people to take up the habit.

To ban smoking from all the restaurants in the country may seem too stern a measure, but that does not mean there is no merit to this idea. Rather, if smoking was banned from restaurants, but with the flexibility of acquiring a license and increased taxes to allow the restaurants to act as smoking lounges, it will be substantially more beneficial in the long run. There would be reduced risk of social unrest as dedicated smokers could still cherish a space that accomodates their vice, whilst people who would be rightfully uncomfortable from passive smoking could easily choose to avoid the lounges.

To invoke sustainable change in our society, even for its betterment, it cannot be conducted through extreme measures and banning smoking from all the restaurants in the country is exactly that. A more nuanced approach should be entertained.
