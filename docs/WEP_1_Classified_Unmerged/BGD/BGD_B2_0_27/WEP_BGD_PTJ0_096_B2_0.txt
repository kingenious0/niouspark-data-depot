As a student it is very tough to bear the cost of needs and wants as they are not getting paid like the adults and also the reason behind this is they cannot apply for a job because they does not have certain skills to do the job and additionally they cannot do the job side by side to their education because it requires full time of their day. Aside from that they need the financial support to fulfill their needs and wants otherwise the lack of fullfillment in their life can have an affect on their mental health. So it is very vital to have some sort of financial balance in the college students life to have a smooth mental condition and having a part time job side by side to their studies can help in this situation.

A part time job is a type of job which is done in a short period of time rather than having a 9-5 job which occupies the whole day. One can easily do this kind of job on their free time or for example one can work at a coffee shop for 2 hours while being busy with other chores the rest of the day. By having a part time job a college student can buy books, foods, essentials, technologies needed for him or her to study and etc. Sometimes it can help them to pay rent when the student is living in a studio apartment and even sometimes tuition fees. A student can coach other students and get paid which can be considered a good example of a part time job.

So in my opinion having a part time job as a college student can play a significant role in their financial situation and also their mental health.
