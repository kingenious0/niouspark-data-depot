 Smoking should be prohibited at all the restaurants in Bangladesh. Considering the harmful effects of smoking cigarettes not only on the person doing it but also on the people around them, there should be definite laws ensuring the need of refraining oneself from it. 
Since there's a term called secondhand smoke exposure which occurs when people breath in smoke breathed out by people who smoke and even this brief exposure has deadly effects on human body. 
Additionally, people in public especially the children between the age group of 15-19 basically teenagers get fascinated and influenced by this. Restaurant is a place where all groups of people come to enjoy their time and others smoking in an open place can be a very unpleasant experience for nonsmokers.
As I have mentioned smoking having impact on other's health it also can cause discomfort to people who have health issues like asthma. We can prevent the deaths caused by secondhand smoking by enforcing the laws. 
Lastly people visit restaurants to have a cheerful time with their families, friends or anyone it might be not to get affected by passive smoking.
In my opinion smoking ban law should be enforced in all restaurants in the country seeing all the negative effects the smoking behavior causes.
