 
 The case for banning smoking at all restaurants across the country has been a contentious issue. Smoking is a leading source of avoidable health issues, such as heart disease, respiratory diseases, various forms of cancer, etc.

Therefore, when smoking is permitted in restaurants, not only do smokers put themselves at risk but non-smokers are also put in harm's way due to indirect inhalation of smoke particles. Moreover, allowing smoking in restaurants can create an unpleasant and uncomfortable environment for non-smokers leading to limited options for customers who prefer smoke-free spaces. 

However, some restaurants have separate areas for smokers to smoke and enjoy whatever items the restaurant has to offer. Even so, restaurant employees are at a higher risk of developing health problems due to continuous exposure during their work hours in the smoking zone. 

By prohibiting smoking in restaurants, a healthier and more welcoming environment can be created, encouraging more people to dine out without the worry of being exposed to dangerous toxins and would protect the health of employees. 

As a result, I agree banning smoking in restaurants countrywide will be beneficial and create a healthier environment as well as encourage positive lifestyle choices. Even so, there might be negative economic repercussions for the restaurant industry, due to loss of business from smokers. On the contrary, they often result in increased visitations from non-smokers who appreciate the smoke-free environment.
