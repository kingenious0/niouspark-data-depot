 Smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants nationwide to protect public health, create a smoke-free environment and promote a more enjoyable dining experience for all.

 Firstly , a complete ban on smoking in restaurants is essential to protect public health. Smoking in restaurants exposes staff and other guests to these toxic substances, increasing the risk of respiratory disease, heart disease and other health problems. By enacting a smoke-free environment, restaurants can ensure a healthier environment for all and reduce the potential long-term health effects.

Secondly , banning smoking in restaurants helps create a smoke-free environment.. People with respiratory disease, allergies and smoking sensitivities may be particularly affected, which may cause discomfort or even refuse to eat out. The restaurant's non-smoking environment ensures that all guests can enjoy their meals without being exposed to dangers.

 Additionally, implementing a 100% smoke-free restaurant policy can have a positive impact on public perception and attract a wider customer base. Many people, especially families with children, prefer to dine in non-smoking establishments. By catering to this preference, restaurants can increase their appeal to a wider audience and potentially grow their business.. Many countries have banned indoor smoking in public places for public health reasons.

 In summary, a complete ban on smoking in all restaurants nationwide is a necessary step to protect public health, create a smoke-free environment, and improve the overall dining experience. The benefits of such bans outweigh individual preferences as they contribute to a safer, cleaner and more enjoyable dining environment for all.
