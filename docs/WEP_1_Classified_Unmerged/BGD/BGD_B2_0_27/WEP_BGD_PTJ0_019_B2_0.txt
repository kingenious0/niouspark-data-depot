 For a college student I don't think part time jobs are that important. The time span of a college student in this country is two years max. In these two years they have to complete a big syllabus for their HSC. I personally think that the time span is really short and the syllabus is big compared to the duration. Other than that you have to give several test exams for your preparation. It is important to utilize your time for studies. HSC exam is one of the most important exam in our life. For higher education as well as in the job life. The result of HSC matters a lot. Also, college is a place where you meet new people, new things to learn. The extra curriculum activities are also significantly important. I believe, the more someone explores new things, the more lessons they learn in life. 
At the end of the day, money is the most important thing in your life. In college life, one can do tuitions for some extra pocket money. I used to do it. But par time jobs are more hard working and time consuming. One need to focus more on their studies and other activities rather than doing a part time job.
So, I believe part time jobs are not important for college students.
