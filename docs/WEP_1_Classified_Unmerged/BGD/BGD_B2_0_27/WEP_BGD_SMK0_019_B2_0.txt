 Restaurant business is one of the most rapidly growing industry right now in our country. In every other corner we see a café or a restaurant.  From teen agers to millennials everyone often visits a restaurant. A common thing in these modern restaurants is almost every one of them has a smoking zone in there. Now, smoking as we all know is injurious to health and environment. But this is something that cannot be controlled overnight. There is no such law in our country where one cannot smoke publicly. The café and restaurant owners grabbed this opportunity with both hands and to attract more customer they provided a smoking zone. I am a nonsmoker but I often see smokers tend to have a cigarette with their coffee or having a cigarette after their meal. It is a very common practice for them. But there are other people in the restaurants as well specially kids. This can be very harmful for them. I believe that the smoking zone in a restaurant should not be in an open place where other customers will get affected. It should be in a separate place.
So, in my opinion restaurants can have a smoking zone but in a place where the other customers will not get affected.
