 A part- time job is a very important added advantage for an individual before getting a full-time job. It adds experience for that particular individual. More the experience, better for the individual. However, it depends on when the individual will start their part-time job. 
Having a part time job during college can be both good and bad at the same time. Good in this sense, this prepares the student before joining university or even long before he or she gets their actual job. But bad in this sense, the hours that will be spend behind part time jobs, these hours can be spend behind academic progressions which can help the student pass their college with ease. If somehow a student manages to do both, then it is good for him but it becomes very tiring and might also hamper their academic progress. It all comes down to how a student manages their tasks daily.
Let's say for example: I am college student, I spend most times in my college, come back home and run straight to coaching classes. This will already make me super tired. I won't be able to do other extracurricular activities, doing a part-time job besides college will cramp up my daily schedules as I will have less time to study for myself. However, if the student has enough time, they can have a part time job. So, I disagree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
