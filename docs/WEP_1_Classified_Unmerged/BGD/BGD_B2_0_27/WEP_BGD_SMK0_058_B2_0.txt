 Banning smoking at all the restaurants might create some short comings which seems neglectful but should be considered. I disagree to the fact that smoking should be banned completely in restaurants Because of three reasons. Such as: better monitoring system, less uncomfortableness for non smokers, less littering. 

At first, Smoking inside a designated facility such as restaurant smoking zone creates better monitoring. Nowadays smoking here and there has created a mass area to monitor. Which can be solved under designated areas as they are covered in CCTV facility. If this is not allowed, smoking inside sensitive areas will create much hazards.

Secondly, smoking inside a designated area will ease the pain of non smokers by making the situation less uncomfortable. No smokers face the majority of the problem of facing sudden blows of cigarette smoke coming towards their faces. Smoking inside smoking zones will lessen this problem even more. 

Lastly, smoking creates littering because of the burnt or used butts are not disposed accordingly. The smoke of smoking affects the air but the left overs of smoking affects the soil. It litters our roads, blocks our drainage system and if not affects the whole eco system. Every smoking zone in restaurants has littering boxes or ash tray and dustbin for the butts to be disposed. It Will decrease a marginal amount of littering. 

Banning a system doesn't change the affects rather creates permanent hazards which might seem negligible. Banning smoking inside restaurant will never stop people from smoking. Rather it is an opportunity to initiate better monitoring, ample ambiance for non smokers and less littering.
