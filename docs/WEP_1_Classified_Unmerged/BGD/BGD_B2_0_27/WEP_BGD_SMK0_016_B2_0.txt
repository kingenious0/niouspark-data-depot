 Smoking is a very common thing in every country across the world. Some like smoking, while others don't. It is a very personal choice and nobody is bothered if the other person is smoking or not, unless it's someone's parents or their significant half. However, in a country like Bangladesh, smoking is very common and people can be seen smoking in the open.
However, I don't think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. As long as the non-smokers are not disturbed by the smokers, it seems okay to smoke in a restaurant because most restaurants have a separate space for smokers and non-smokers. Some people visit specific restaurants because they can't smoke in the open or at their home, so they visit these particular restaurants to smoke. This also helps the restaurant in some way, as they have to buy food as well besides smoking in a separate space.
For example: I am a non-smoker, I don't like cigarette smoke around my food. If anyone smokes cigarette while I am having food, this will automatically irritate me and I will never visit that restaurant again. However, If I am having my food separately, and the smoker is enjoying smoking in cigarette in a different corner then I don't see any problem here. So, I disagree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
