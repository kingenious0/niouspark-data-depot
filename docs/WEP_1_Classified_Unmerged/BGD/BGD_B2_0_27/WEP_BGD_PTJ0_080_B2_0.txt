 A college education is becoming increasingly expensive and competitive, requiring students to work more than one or two part-time jobs to fund their education. However, this is mostly seen in Western countries but not as much as in other parts of the world. 

Some people may argue that working part-time may hinder academic performance and overall well-being. In my opinion, having a part-time job during college is beneficial for several experiences. For instance, working part time can help gain practical experience, which allows students to utilise their theoretical knowledge in real-life situations and develop a better understanding of their field of study.

Moreover, students learn how to manage their time between studies, work or other activities effectively, ensuring discipline and commitment. Furthermore, students get the opportunity to network with people which can open gates to better jobs, internships, etc. 

On the other hand, students understand the responsibility of handling their finances and independence. Students also have a personal growth when they encounter challenges, which in return may build awareness.

Despite everything, not every student can get the opportunity to work part-time and gain hands-on experience due to increasing population and demand for experienced workers or just because of lack of opportunity in their area.

In conclusion, I believe it is important for a student to work part-time during college, even though, it is not mandatory.
