I completely agree that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking is a very strong addiction that has taken over people of all ages. Smoking has so many harmful effects on a smoker's health. For example, it damages his lungs and increases the risk of getting cancer. A significant number of people, from all over the world die each year just because of this addiction. Smoking hinders a smoker's health improvement. However, this bad habit not only kills the person who's doing it, but also damages the health and risks the lives of people around him. As a consequence, when a smoker smokes in a restaurant, the smoke produced from cigarettes causes suffocation to others around him. In a restaurant, there might be people who are suffering from asthma. It can be really dangerous and deadly for them to stay in a room full of tobacco smoke. Moreover, old people with heart problems suffer a lot when someone smokes around them. So smoking in a restaurant can affect their heart and cause the heart to damage even more. Smoking also makes the place dirty and unhygienic. Smoking at a restaurant can have an impact on a child's health as well. Studies have shown that, smoke produced from cigars harm other people more than the one who's smoking it. So it should be banned as a smoker harms his health as well as of the others.
