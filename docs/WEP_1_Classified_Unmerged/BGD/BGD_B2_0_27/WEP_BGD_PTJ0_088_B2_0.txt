 Part-time jobs are crucial in an individual's life. It shapes their future by giving them a taste of the real professional world. Having a part-time job can benefit a student in multiple ways. Students are able to learn time-management and communication among other soft skills which are highly valued by employers and can greatly boost their chances of recruitment.

When looking for a part-time job, students must think about their interests, talents and availability.  Students can start their own businesses online. If they specialise in a certain skill set such as graphic designing, content creating or photography they may provide freelancing services. If they excel in academics and teaching, they can provide tuition to others. Personally, I have been tutoring ever since my IGCSEs because it gives me the opportunity to share my knowledge with others and create an impact. But the main reason is that it enables me to be financially independent.

Financial stability is one of the main benefits of part-time jobs. It allows students to pay for their education and lifestyle without the added guilt of pressuring their family. Another benefit is the ability to gain work experience which makes a student more valuable to recruiters during employment. It gives them a better idea of what field to pursue as a profession in the future. Part-time jobs also ingrain a sense of independence and self-assurance, even within people of timid nature, which adds great value to any individual's life.

If not conducted properly, there are also certain drawbacks to part-time jobs. Students may struggle to balance their work and academics, which can lead to them feeling overhwelmed and hamper their academic performance. Therefore, although I strongly believe part-time jobs are essential to a student, it completely depends if the individual themself can cope with the increased pressure or not.
