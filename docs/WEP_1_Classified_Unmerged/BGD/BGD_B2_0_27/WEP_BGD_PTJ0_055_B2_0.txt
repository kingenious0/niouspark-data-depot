 Yes, I agree that college students should have a part-time job. A job can teach a lot of things to a student at a youthful age. Some examples of it are managing money, time schedule, teamwork, working with clients etc. Managing a student life and a job at the same time can be a bold task for someone. It is an arduous task but if someone is up for it one should do it. 

 

In a typical middle-class family, the parents don't give pocket money to kids to spend on their leisure. Teenagers like to spend their free time with friends, going to the movies, eating at restaurants, café hopping etc. To do these activities one needs money. For upper-class kids, it might not be a problem as they get a handsome amount of pocket money but for a middle-class kid it is a problem as they do not have the luxury to spend money on activities like this. But it can be changed by having a part-time job. If a middle-class family kid works a part-time job, he/she can afford such activities and can have fun with their friend, they can be independent in a sense. 

 
 
It's not that upper-class kids shouldn't get part-time jobs, there is so much one can learn from them. Most of the population in this country are poor, most of them are doing odd jobs or doing part-time / lower paid jobs because of not having academic learning. By doing part-time jobs with them a student can learn about their struggles and hardships. This may help them in their future and to relate with people and sympathize with them and see that not everyone has luxury, and everyone has struggles in their lives. 

 
 
So, I would always suggest college students have a part-time job.
