Smoking is fatal for health, smoking can cause terrible health concerns such as lung cancer, stroke, heart disease, asthma, bronchitis and so on. Smoking can even make a person go blind. 
However, it is a choice a person makes. On the other hand, secondhand smoke which occurs due to being in front of another smoker can be equally harmful. It can be as fatal as smoking itself. Worst part of this is we do not even know what harm it causes us just being with them while they smoke. 

I agree, smoking in public places should be totally prohibited. There can be pregnant people who are unaware of the issues that smoking can bring such as harming the baby, including low birth weight. Sometimes it is more dangerous than smoking the cigarette ourselves as it is the residue of another person's smoke. 

Smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. If someone smokes at a restaurant where a family went to enjoy it might as well make them very uncomfortable and sick, if a member has asthma, he or she can have an instant reaction to second hand smoke.

By banning smoking in restaurants, we are enabling a safer and healthier risk-free environment for people around us which will protect everyone. By creating a smoke free environment, we are ensuring safety of everyone around us.  A person that wants to smoke can go to a smoking area instead of harming others through passive smoke. Smoking in public places should be banned.
