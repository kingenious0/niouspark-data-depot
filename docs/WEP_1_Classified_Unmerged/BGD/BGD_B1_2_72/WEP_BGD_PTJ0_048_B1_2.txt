The choice to work a part-time job while in college should ultimately be based on the person's personal situation, financial need, academic objectives, and capacity for time management.It can be advantageous if a part-time employment reduces financial strain without materially affecting academic performance. But if it begins to harm their performance in class or general wellbeing, it can be necessary to reevaluate the burden or look at other options, such scholarships, financial aid, or internships.
