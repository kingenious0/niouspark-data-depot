Nowadays, smoking cigarettes---which is extremely harmful to your health---is fashionable. In restaurants, both adults and teenagers are smoking in public. Such labor degrades the atmosphere of the restaurants and makes it uncomfortable for non-smoking patrons. 
Smoking in restaurants is harmful to people's health because it impacts everyone's health. People who don't even smoke have to breathe in the gas that smokers exhale, which has an impact on everyone's health. Anyhow, a restaurant is a common gathering place where many children go to spend time with their parents. But because of the gas the smoker breathed after smoking, the child also has to suffer. It adversely affects the environment in every way imaginable. 
Both smokers and non-smokers find it awkward to be at restaurants where smoking is allowed. When a smoker puffs on a cigarette, he detracts from the restaurant's lovely ambiance by expelling gas that makes the place quite odorous. Additionally, because youth in our society are smoking openly in front of their elders, their respects is eroding. 
Being in restaurants where smoking is permitted causes discomfort for both smoker and non-smokers. Smokers ruin the restaurant's pleasant environment by exhaling gas that gives the space a strong odor when they puff on a cigarette. Youth in our society are also losing respect for their elders as a result of smoking openly in front of them.
