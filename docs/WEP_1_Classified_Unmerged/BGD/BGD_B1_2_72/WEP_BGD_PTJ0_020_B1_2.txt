 I actually take a neutral stand for this statement. 
Doing the part-time is a good thing for student as by doing so, we are learning to be independent as well as earning some money.  It's also help us to understand the importance of money. As, we realize that earning money is not an easy thing to do. We have to do work hard to earn it. As a result, we learn the importance of money and learnt how to manage it. It also help us to develop our personality. Due to doing a part-time job, we became more confident. But doing a part-time job is a hard things to do as most of the student actually finds it quite difficult to manage part-time job as well as the time of studying and socializing with friends and family. Being a student, is actually a full-time job. Sometimes, students became too overwhelmed by maintaining both together. This might result in poor performance at college and having no friends and socials life. It's actually vary from person to person. If the student is actually be able to balances  both part-time job as well doing well at school. Then he/she should definitely do the part-time job. If not,  then he/she should not do the job and should just focus in his/her studies.
