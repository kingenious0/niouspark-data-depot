Many people might have issues. When it comes to family the parents never want their child watch smoking people around.it encourage people to smoke more.so we should create some limitations. Business persons says that it will bring loses if they don't allow smoke. But I believe restaurants can still make profits because the main purpose of coming restaurants is food and comfort. Everyone knows that smoking affects people's health. . Lung cancer and respiratory issues can both be brought on by smoking cigarettes. Undoubtedly, we cannot forbid someone from smoking if they do not value their own health. However, because the majority of restaurants are air-conditioned, when someone smokes, the smoke will spread over the entire establishment via the ventilation system. Additionally, secondhand smokers have a high risk of developing cancer. Without a doubt, the prohibition may have an impact on a few enterprises' revenue levels. However, nonsmokers make up the majority of restaurant patrons. The public's health will be enhanced if smoking is outlawed in all restaurants. The most crucial factor for people is their health. You can do everything you want to if you're in good enough health. Even though the current economic downturn requires us to take economic stability into account, if our citizens are healthy and willing to work hard enough, the economy will return eventually.
