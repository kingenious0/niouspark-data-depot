 We all know that smoking is injurious to health. Smoking causes cancer. Though many people smoke to get relief from their stress. During intense pressure or stressful work, some people are quite used to smoking as it works as a pressure reliever for them. Some people smoke in their offices, public places, home, restaurant, tea stalls, etc.
But restaurants are suitable places to hang out with friends, families, etc. No one wants to see young children playing with cigarettes. If people want to relax by smoking instead of taking coffee or food it will be disturbing and annoying for other people. However, those smokers can smoke at their homes or in suitable places so that people will not feel any disturbance. 
However most of the restaurants are air-conditioned, when someone smokes, the smoke will spread through the whole restaurant which is harmful to non-smoker people. They also have a great chance of getting cancer. 
So from all perspectives, I don't think that smoking should be allowed in the restaurant. However, I think the majority of customers are non-smokers so if smoking is banned from the restaurant it will not affect the profit of the restaurant. It will also help to improve the health of the people. Health is the most important thing.
So, for all these reasons I agree with the statement.
