 I totally agreed with the following statement that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. It should be banned because of the health risks.
As everyone knows smoking affects people's health. Smoking can cause lung cancer and many health problems. Most of the restaurants are air-conditioned. When someone smokes, the smoke will spread through the whole restaurant. Second-hand smokers will also have a chance of getting cancer. There should have smoking zone in the restaurants. Otherwise, other customers will face trouble, as they must breathe in the cigarette smoke.
Restaurants should be suitable places for families to go to. Sometimes young children and old people also visit the restaurants. If someone smokes in a restaurant that might be harmful for those people. The ban of smoking may affect the income for a few restaurant businesses. However, the majority of the customers are non-smokers.
Nowadays, people are more aware of the importance of health. So, people thing this proposal will bring about the benefits on public health. If smoking is banned in all the restaurants, it will help to improve people's health. Health is the most important thing for people. If you are healthy enough, then you can do whatever you want to do. Restaurants should consider people's health rather than considering their income.
