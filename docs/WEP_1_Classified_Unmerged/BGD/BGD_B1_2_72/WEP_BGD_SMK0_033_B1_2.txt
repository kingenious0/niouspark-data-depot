  Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country  I agree with this argument. There are various reasons for which I stand by this claim. Health issues, fine dining experience, clean and pleasant environment. 
Smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke have been proven to have harmful effects on health. Restaurants are public spaces where people of all ages, including children visit to dine and socialize. A smoking ban ensures that non-smokers, especially vulnerable groups, are protected from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke. It promotes a healthier society by reducing overall tobacco consumption and the associated health risks. Non-smokers can enjoy their meals without being exposed to the discomfort and annoyance of secondhand smoke. The implementation of a smoking ban in restaurants enables positive role modeling. By establishing smoke-free areas, it is made very obvious that smoking is not a desired or socially acceptable habit. This can discourage young people from starting to smoke and encourage healthier lifestyle choices. It helps to reinforce not smoking in public norm in society that creates a positive impact. A complete prohibition on smoking in establishments could be another incentive for people who want to give up smoking. By limiting smoking chances in public areas, it supports the decision to stop smoking and promotes an environment that is supportive of those trying to live healthier lives.
