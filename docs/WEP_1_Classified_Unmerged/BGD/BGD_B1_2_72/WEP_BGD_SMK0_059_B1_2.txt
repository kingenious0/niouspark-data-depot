 Smoking is definitely something negative and should not have existed at the first place, there is no doubt in that. But since it does, it is affiliated not only with our health, but also with a lot of important things like our entire economy. Here is why I disagree with the statement mentioned the title. 
'Smoking is injurious to health' is a statement we often see almost everywhere from movie intros to the walls of the bus. Ironic enough but the package itself has the statement printed on it. But people still smoke. As we know that it is a choice but sadly often it is not. People often get dangerously addicted to the point they cannot quit anymore. 
Now let's talk about smoking being a choice. As much as a fantastic idea it would be to ban smoking from all the restaurants in the country, it will still be a huge injustice to a large amount of people. No matter how self-sabotaging and harmful the decision is, it is still a country of free will. Just because some of us think it will be a good idea, we cannot just force our ideologies on someone else. Not to mention, how a great deal of customers a restaurant is going to lose if they ban smoking from their place because they won't have a variety of adjustments for all kinds of their customers. 
Although banning smoking from all restaurants in the country might sound like a good idea to a lot of us, it will be a matter of great disrespect towards people's respective choices and a huge business risk for restaurants at the same time. Instead, restaurants should make arrangements for both types of people by having two different areas for smokers and non-smokers. This way everybody wins.
