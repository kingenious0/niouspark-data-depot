.   There is a proverb  Smoking causes cancer''-putting that in our consideration we can agree to the above statement. If the restaurant provides a soothing environment for all the customers then smoking can be accepted there. Following the statistics of ''British American Tobacco(BAT) which is one of the largest multinational corporations, we come to know that-''Bangladesh contributes approximately more than two-thirds of the revenue derived from the cigarette industry,having contributed over BDT 29.5 crore as taxes to the National Exchequer in the year 2022.'' In this case an eminent part of our economy relies on the tobacco sales. An adult knows about the pros and cons of smoking. It depends on the person whether he/she will do it or not. To maintain a healthy life one must stop smoking as smoking can cause diseases like- cancer, stroke, diabetes,chronic bronchitis etc. Smoking in public places is hazardous not only for the smoker but also for the people around him/her. It also causes air pollution and endangers our environment. Now-a-days some restaurants in our country have smoking zone and it is separated from the food corner. According to me, it provides an acceptable environment for both the smokers and the non-smokers. My opinion about it will be- smoking can be allowed in the restaurants if the restaurant has a specific smoking zone. Otherwise the smoke can cause a hazardous situation for the non-smokers too. Our economy earns a good amount of revenue on the exportation of tobacco. It will not be a good idea to eliminate this from our industry. But when we are talking about a good environment in our restaurants,it is necessary for the restaurant to provide the customers with what they feel comfortable with.
