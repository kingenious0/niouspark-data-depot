Smoking is frowned upon everywhere in the world, it harms the person consuming cigarettes as well as the people around them and their environment. Smoking is not good for anyone except restaurant owners who can use it to their advantage. Nowadays, any place that allows people a place to sit down for a coffee and cigarettes becomes the new hotspot. Banning smoking in restaurants does not really reduce the number of people that smoke, as people that smoke will continue to smoke, just at a different place or at their own homes, therefore banning smoking at restaurants is kind of redundant. From a business stand point, having a smoking zone at your restaurant is a huge cash grab, as you will not be losing customers, instead you will be attracting more. You may lose some customers who actively are against smoking or have their kids with them, but in the bigger picture having a smoking zone is more profitable than not having one. Therefore, smoking at restaurants should not be banned if the incentive is to get people to stop smoking, in Bangladesh cigarettes are very easily accessible and even when taxed heavily it is quite cheap, it will be nearly impossible to stop people from consuming it, no matter how many labels you put on it with scary pictures and warnings.
