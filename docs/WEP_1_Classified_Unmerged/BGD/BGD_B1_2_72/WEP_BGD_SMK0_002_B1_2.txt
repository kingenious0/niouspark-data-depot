 Yes, I agree with the statement that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. No wonder how smoking is so much harmful for the environment and also smoking can be a bad influence for other people.
Smoking plays a big role in environment and air pollution. It pollutes the fresh air and makes it feel dizzy. There is no logic behind letting anyone smoke in a renowned restaurant. It can never bring any positive outcome.  If someone is going to a restaurant, they do not expect to get sick of its air or environment.  A restaurants atmosphere and air should be refreshing and beautiful to be in. 
 In addition, smoking is always a bad influence to everyone. No matter if a person smokes or not, if someone is smoking around or publicly, it can trigger the demand for smoking for those who soke. It can influence the people who doesn't smoke as well. 
Moreover, there is a thing called second-hand smoking. If someone is smoking nearby, it's smoke can lead to a second-hand smoking to the people who are not smoking. It's harmful just like first-hand smoking.
Thus, every restaurant should ban smoking. It will be a wise and logical decision keeping it's customers health and well-being in mind.
