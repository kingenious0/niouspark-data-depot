Without any doubt smoking is very dangerous habit for anyone. There are uncountable proven bad disadvantages of the habit of smoking. It is not only effects on the smoker but also causes dangerous health issues to the surrounding of the smoker. Now, offering smoking in restaurant has became traditional thing in human life style. But they should remember that only smokers don't visit restaurants. Family persons, kids, senior citizen, pregnant women also visit restaurant to spend some quality time with their dear one while eating food. Smoking permission in a restaurant is nothing but a cheap thrills. In this modern era most restaurants are fully covered with air cooler. So whenever a smoker light up cigarettes, smoke makes the environment very suffocating. Though it is very hard to stop smoking tobacco ,we can suggest a smoking zone. Surprisingly bunch of restaurant owner think that open place restaurant can offer smokers to smoke without any hesitations which is completely wrong. Beside so many restrictions, if we take any step to stop smoking in restaurant, it may take long time but in some day people will understand its importance. Therefore I do agree that smking should be controlled or even banned in restaurants, especially those which are family firendly.
