To ensure a healthy dining experience for all citizens, the complete prohibition of smoking in restaurants across the country emerges as an urgent and crucial necessity.  Smoking is regarded as a contentious and pervasive habit that offers significant health concerns to both smokers and non-smokers. As the harmful health effects of secondhand have become more apparent, the call for smoke-free environments has grown stronger.

To begin with, it is essential for eateries to be suitable place for families to go to. For instance, McDonald's attracts many families with young children. It is pivotal to make sure that such places remain smoke-free, as nobody would want to witness children exposed to such hazards. It is undeniable that many customers want to smoke while having their meals but if the new rules are imposed everywhere, they are bound to follow them.  

Furthermore, the ban of smoking will safeguard the health of both personnel and customers. Smoking in restaurants has been believed to negatively impact the flavor of foods and has also led to diminish employee productivity as they are constantly exposed to secondhand smoke. Besides, implementing a smoking ban could contribute in reducing the prevalence of active smokers. Banning smoking in public areas can act as a deterrent for potential smokers and motivating existing smokers to kick the habit. Consequently, there is a probable reduction in smoking rates, leading to a heathier population and a decline in smoking related diseases. 

To sum up, implementing a countrywide ban on smoking in all restaurants is an essential step towards promoting public health and well-being. Moreover, a nicotine free dining environment will enhance the overall pleasure for all customers, which will make restaurants more appealing and inclusive spaces for everyone.
