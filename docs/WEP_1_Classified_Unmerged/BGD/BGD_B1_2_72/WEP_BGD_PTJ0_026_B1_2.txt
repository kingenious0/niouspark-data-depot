 In 2023, having a part-time job as a college student is a must. Earning your own money should be a basic thing that you do and it is not something that should be glorified. It is essential to have a part time job as a college student because it will instill a sense of responsibility in you, make you appreciate what your parents do for you, and make you understand the value of money. 

Firstly, you will learn to take responsibility when you have a part-time job. This is because you will now be sacrificing your free time where you would earlier play games, watch movies, or go on hangouts. You will now be replacing it by doing a job and working really hard for it. This is a big step in life and it changes how a person views the world.

Secondly, you will learn to understand the value of money. Your personal income will allow you to be more realistic and thoughtful about your spending. This first-hand experience will make you financially responsible and give you skills that you can utilize in your future. 

Lastly, you will begin to appreciate everything your parents have done for you so far. Working in a part-time job will make you view the world from a different perspective. You will begin to see your parents' point of view as now you will be working really hard to earn every little money that you earn and you will get to have a glimpse of how much time and dedication your parents put in order to feed you and raise you.

To conclude, it is a no-brainer that working a part-time job as a college student is crucial. Without doing it, you will be limiting yourself in your comfort zone and will not develop.
