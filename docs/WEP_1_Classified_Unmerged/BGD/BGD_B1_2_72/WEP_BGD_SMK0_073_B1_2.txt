I agree with the above statement. Even though, smoking is a personal habit it comes with a lot of backlashes. The fumes from cigarettes are harmful for the people inhaling it passively just as much as someone inhaling it directly from smoking. Nicotine is a harmful substance which is a part of cigarette and it causes cancer. It severely damages one's lungs and can cause fatal diseases like lung cancer. When someone is smoking cigarettes in a social setting, the smoke is prone to be inhaled by everyone around them in a close proximity. Especially in places like restaurants a lot of people are likely to get affected by the fumes of smokers smoking in the restaurant. Some people might already suffer from major diseases and inhaling smoke may either create other physical complexities or can increase the fatality of the diseases that they may already have. Keeping that in mind, one should not smoke in a public social setting like restaurants because it may hamper other people's well-being. With that being said, everyone deserves to have their own rights and if one wants they can smoke but it needs to be made sure that one's personal habits shouldn't affect someone else or the society.
