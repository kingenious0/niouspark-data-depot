 In today's world doing a side hustle and making a passive income has turned out to be a necessity for us students. We want to be financially free and would want the tendency to be able to afford whatever we need, rather than asking our parents. 
Even though most of our parents are paying our education expenses, we should come to our realization to support them financially in whatever way we can. Moreover, doing a part-time job would also help us gain valuable work experience that may enhance our skills and career prospects. For i.e. If someone works in a call center agency, he/she might be able to develop a certain level of communication skills in English speaking or persuasion techniques to grab a customer.
Later on, this would also help us earn extra money which we might be able to use for leisure activities, invest in crypto or stocks, or save up for buying new gadgets. Certain jobs may also help us develop interpersonal skills by interacting with different people. For i.e. if someone is working as a salesman, he/she may be able to pursue customer wants by dealing with different individuals every day.
Furthermore, this would also help us to understand the true value of money by earning our own money and managing within our budget. Students should also be able to adapt to a work-life balance, so doing a part-time job would help us to learn time management by balancing studies and work commitments.
In conclusion, having a part-time job while pursuing higher education is quite prominent for college students as it allows us to learn sets of practical skills and gives a financial independence to live in the way we would choose to be.
