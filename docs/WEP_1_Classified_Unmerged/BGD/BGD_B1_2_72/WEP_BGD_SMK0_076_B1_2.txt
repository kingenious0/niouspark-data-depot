 Smoking has detrimental impacts on both active and passive smokers. It is proven that smoking leads to health issues for both chain smokers and people close by.  Due to its harmful effects, some believe that smoking should be banned from restaurants. I agree with their statement.
Medical studies show smoking causes bronchitis, asthma, coronary artery diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and cardiovascular problems. Tobacco leaves contain nicotine. Daily consumption of nicotine can lead to cancer. 
Smoking not only harms the people who choose to do it but also affects the people surrounding them. Passive smokers suffer from suffocation, asthma, lung damage etc. Families often visit restaurants and food courts with their children. Pregnant women, senior citizens and toddlers are often present in restaurants. Often, they suffer from serious health issues because of the toxic fumes.
Often students are seen smoking cigarettes in restaurants surrounding schools, colleges and universities. Non-smokers are usually uncomfortable in these situations. Students often fall victim to peer pressure and start smoking. Many students and employees smoke as a coping mechanism just to fit in their social circles.
Smoking can be a huge fire hazard in diners and restaurants. Most of the restaurants use gas stoves to prepare food. Gas needs just a spark to catch on fire and burn the whole place down. Uncontrolled flames like cigarettes can be very dangerous in these situations.
In conclusion, banning smoking in public places like restaurants can be controversial. Individuals who choose to smoke even after knowing the risk factors should be responsible only for their own health. Considering the damage smoking does it should be banned from restaurants.
