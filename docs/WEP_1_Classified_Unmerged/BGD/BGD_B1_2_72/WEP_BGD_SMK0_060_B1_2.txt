I strongly agree with this statement. We all can agree with the statement that smoking is very bad for one's health. Still some people smoke and they do it in their own will. We can spread awareness but can't force someone to stop smoking. People become addicted to smoking and this addiction is hard to just let go. Our loved ones like, parents, siblings, relatives, children, friends become addicted to smoking which is very sad to see. We want best for our loved ones so we want them to stop this unhealthy practice. Which is why it is important for us to take steps which will distract smokers from smoking and use that time to do or think about other things. And one place where we can take this step is at restaurants. Now-a-days restaurants are commonly one of the most visited places for family gathering, hang out with friends, dates, office discussions as well as to spend some me time. That's why smoking in a restaurant is not only unhealthy for smokers but also for all the people present in that restaurant. if all restaurant bans smoking inside the restaurant then those who smokes will be distracted for that time being. And this step can help casual as well as chain smokers to reduce the amount of cigarettes they smoke in a day. Which might make casual smokers to stop smoking. This step will eventually not only be beneficial for the smokers but it will also be beneficial for non-smokers as well.
