Smoking is very injurious to health. It can cause serious damage to the body. It can cause many lung, heart, and respiratory diseases. It can even lead to death. A cigarette is mostly tobacco that contains nicotine and many harmful substances. Smoking is usually an act of inhaling or breathing in the burned or smoked substance that is in the cigarette and then exhaling it. As it is inhaled and exhaled, the burned smoke goes into the consumer's body and also spreads into the surroundings where he/ she is smoking. So, those who are around can also unintentionally inhale that smoke. Since the smoke contains many harmful substances and harms the body, whoever inhales it gets affected by it. So, those who do not smoke also get affected and may develop some illnesses or diseases caused by the cigarette even if they do not smoke. Some people also have asthma and due to the smoke, they might face asthma attacks.  So, it is not right to smoke in public places. For example; restaurants, cafes, etc. Many people go to restaurants and there are children, the elderly, the young, and many different types of people with different health problems. If someone smokes in public places like this, it can affect the health of the non-smokers too. They can develop any lung or heart or respiratory diseases. The children or elderly might have an asthma attack. The smoker is risking everyone's health by smoking in a restaurant. So, smoking should be banned completely at all restaurants in the country.
