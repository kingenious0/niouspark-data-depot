I think it's important for a college student to do part time job if it is not affecting his/her studies.At this point of life everyone should start knowing how to handle their own finance and start saving for future. Everyone should carry their own responsibility financially.Generally the students who are attending college are 18 years old which is considered as the adult age for a person.At this age a person should try to start earning legally and try to become financially independent.This will also enable a student to have a proper idea about allowance. In 2020, the percentage of undergraduate students who were employed was higher among part-time students(74 percent) than among full-time students(40 percent).College period is an important aspect of life.It's necessary to focus on studies and maintain a good score in every exam. The lessons that we learn in college plays a great role in shaping up our future. If we pay enough attention in our classes our lessons become easier. Maintaining a good CGPA is also a significant part for a student. On the other hand, doing extra curricular activities such as- club work,debate,sports etc. are indispensable. These helps a student to socialize and to have a good experience on college life.Depending on the above discussion we can conclude that, a student should do a part time job and try to become financially independent if it's not endangering his/her academic life.
