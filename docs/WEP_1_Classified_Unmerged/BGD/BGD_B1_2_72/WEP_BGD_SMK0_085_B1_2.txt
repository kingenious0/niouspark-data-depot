 Yes, I do agree with the statement that smoking should be permanently banned at all the restaurant in the country. There are some logical explanations to support my statement.

Public Health Concerns : Smoking is a well-known health hazard. Smoking causes serious threat to everyone's health. Non-smokers who are exposed to secondhand smoke, run the risk of developing significant health conditions like heart diseases and respiratory disorders. It is just as harmful as actually smoking. In our country, Restaurants are indoor spaces with poor ventilation systems. So smoke can quickly spread throughout the space and cause health problems for both customers and employees. Banning smoking in restaurants would help protect everyone's health. Hence restaurants should prohibit smoking. 

Cleaner Environment : Smoking not only causes health problems but also creates an unpleasant environment for everyone. Cigarette smoke can linger on clothing and other surfaces, leaving an unpleasant smell and causing the restaurant to be less clean. So smoking restrictions will make the air cleaner and the surroundings more welcoming for everyone. When dining out, non-smokers frequently find it uncomfortable and unpleasant to be around smoke. 
Promoting Healthier Habits : A smoking ban in restaurants may persuade smokers to cut back on their overall tobacco use or give up completely. Because fewer people smoking will result in lower healthcare expenses and a healthier population, this could improve public health outcomes.

Overall, we can see the benefit of banning smoking at the restaurant. There are several strong reasons why smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country.  So we should be more conscious and aware regarding this matter to lead a happy and healthy life.
