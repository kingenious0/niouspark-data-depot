It is important for a collge student to have a part time job and i agree with that. Because in our country majority of the people are student.  And every student financial status are not the same as we know our is a developing country.Many of our students depends on part time jobs to pay their tution fees and other expenses.Not only it helps finacially but also it sharpens our skills.Which will help us in our future jobs and activities.But some people sees student part time job as a waste of their times.Because they think that part time jobs hampers their education and aslo wastes their time.But mostly it depends on the students. Although students should not mix or clash theirs educational studies with their part time jobs. As a result their education will go downfall. Student part time jobs are giving tutions and working as sellsman. This kind of jobs are suitable for students as it doesnt need that much skills. As we may know thats studying in a private university is expensive without scholarships so part time job can come in handy. So part time jobs have some disadvantages but its mostly advantages. So i agree with student part time as its mostly helpfull.
