 The term  part-time job  is a very commonly used phrase in a student's life. It not only brings a student some pocket money but also nurtures his true potential by bringing in a lot of skill sets. While a lot might not agree, I think a student having a part-time job is very much necessary.  
Most people in our society think a student should only run after good grades and heavy certificates before they step into the career phase of their life. They pressurize their kids into this inhumane rat race of getting higher and higher grades, which often kills their true potential and individuality. They fail to understand that having a good career or a successful life doesn't have a particular time to start, rather it's a process to practice and keep getting better at every day. 
When a student is affiliated with a part-time job, he/she will have to push themselves out of their comfort zones a lot. It helps them to acquire a lot of new skill sets. Helps them to get to know people, create a lot of meaningful networks which are helpful for their career in future. The more they blend with people the better they understand how the world works. Besides, by having a paid job they get to learn 'responsibility' and 'accountability'. It's a very important factor that helps them in personal, academic and professional life as well. Having a job teaches them 'professionalism'. Moreover, if a student is smart enough, they will go for a part-time job that will be relevant to their desired future career path. It will help them to better understand their goal and plan accordingly. 
With the entire statement mentioned above, having a part-time job is very important for a student in my opinion.
