As most of the students of college and university are adult, they can start a little step to earn. In south Asian countries like Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and so on, students are dependable so much on their parents money which makes students more unaware about money. When a student starts earning money, it not only teach him to respect even single paisa but also it teaches about money management. Beside understanding the right usage of money, he or she also starts to respect people from any job sector. As it is not possible to feel the struggles of earning money without hard work, part time job can be the most significant way to make it realizable for student at a early age. Beside all these vital matters, part time job can ensure students about what kind of progress and skills they should add in their life style to do better in future. Most of the students remains burden in the time of time management. Even sometime they feel lazy in doing their assignment and other stuffs of their institutions. Part time job can realize them the value of time and the importance of deadline both in job field and academic life. So, I am agree with the statement that shown in above.
