 Yes,I totally agree with the fact that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.College life implies the initiation of a student's independent life as a student learns to do many things to survive alone at this stage; starting from education to basic day to day chores.If a student doesn't grasp the idea of responsibility at this age,they might often take it lightly and suffer in the long run.

Being responsible is a great trait of a human being, so students must learn to be responsible which will often help them in the future.Earning and spending one's own money creates a strong sense of responsibility. It makes a person keep account of their spendings and makes them aware of their capability.It can teach a student to be more sincere about money and to spend it accordingly.For example,a person wouldn't want to spend their hard earned money on unnecessary things and thus be frugal.Besides, if a student has money problems from home, a part-time job could solve it to some extent.And for a student coming from a solvent family, the pay from the job could work as an extra allowance.

Besides growing the sense of responsibility, a part-time job also helps a student to increase skills,manage time,respect seniors in the workplace,learn proper dress code in the workplace,adapt in the new environment and so on. So, a part-time job is very important for students not only to earn extra money but also for developing life skills.
