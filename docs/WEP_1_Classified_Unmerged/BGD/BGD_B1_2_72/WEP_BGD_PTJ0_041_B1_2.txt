A student needs to have a part-time job. Education is expensive; students must spend much extra money on top of their tuition fees, and sometimes it gets difficult to bear. For example, I had to spend more than 3,000 BDT on projects in a course this semester; it felt like much extra money that I did not plan for and for which I did not have a budget. So, it was not easy to handle it. Moreover, students must communicate, socialize, make friends, and spend time with them. Furthermore, it can get expensive to do that. For example, I live in Dhaka city, where you do not have any choice but to choose a restaurant or café to hang out with friends because there are no open places where you do not need to spend money. Even if there were, the excess temperature and humidity would prevent us from doing that, so we would rather stay in our homes. Due to the immense pressure and stress caused by academic life, students deserve to have personal entertainment time. Apart from the fact that I spend a good amount of money on streaming and music platforms each month, sometimes I crave a specific food or drink I want to try out, or sometimes I want to go on a movie date, and mostly we all have our hobbies we want to pursue. So, I think students must have a part-time job.
