Smoking is hazardous to human health. It exists in our society for a long time now. In spite of severe awareness campaigns, smokers are still unable to quit this bad habit. Smoking not only affects the consumer but also people nearby suffer more and if it is a public place, non smokers find it difficult to stay. So, I agree with the statement , Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country .
Moreover, restaurants will be more healthy and safer for people who are health conscious and it will help attracting more health conscious people which as a result, will increase the revenue gained through restaurants. Serious health complications of smoking like heart disease, lung damage can be reduced through this ban implementation. As a result, families will suffer less from treatment costs of health issues. 
Furthermore, this implication may force smokers to quit the habit in a gradual manner. They will be refrained from smoking in public places .This may drastically improve the ambience of the restaurant where children, pregnant women and restaurant waiters and other people can breathe clean air. Restaurants can garner immense praises due to this praiseworthy action of ban on smoking. Everyone can have a wonderful dining experience with their families.
With all that this will bring a positive change in the society as well as health conditions will improve among people. Restaurant industry will thrive and attract new customers who were not pleased with restaurant environments before.
