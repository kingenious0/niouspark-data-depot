When we came to dine in the restaurants, we actually want to have a good time while eating our food. But if we see other people smoking, I as a customer actually don't like it. Moreover, It's also had a bad impact on our health even though I don't a smoke. It's actually remind me an incident when I first go to Ghatphar with friends. I was actually quite surprised to see the ambience. Everyone was actually talking, smoking and eating. It was totally different from my imagination. I was quite obnoxious and uncomfortable at that moment. Suddenly, one of my friends pulls out a pack of cigarette and start to smoke and casually talking to us. Actually, it was nothing new, I have seen my uncles and relatives to smoke. So, after sometime I get used to the scenario. But in my opinions, restaurants should respectfully tell customer they are not allowed to smoke. If they want to smoke, they should leave this restaurants. But most of the restaurants won't do it because it will make them lose customer. So, I think that my opinions about this actually do not hold any importance. But restaurant such as Wooden Spoon have an open space where smoker can dine in and have a cigarette. But this is solution is not applicable to all restaurants!
