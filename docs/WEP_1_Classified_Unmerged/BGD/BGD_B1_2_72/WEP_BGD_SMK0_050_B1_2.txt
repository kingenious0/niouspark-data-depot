 Yes, I agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants. Because everyone has the right to work in a comfortable, clean, and healthy environment. This is hindered due to smoking as it causes discomfort to others and dirties the place with cigarette ashes.   

We have a general idea of how harmful smoking is to one's health. However, inhalation of cigarette smoke present in the air by non-smokers, known as passive smoking or second-hand smoking is as harmful as smoking a cigarette directly. It's important to keep in mind that smoking doesn't only harm the smoker, but also the people around them. The smoke can cause discomfort for those nearby, and for children in particular, it may lead to serious illnesses like cancer later on.   

Smoking in a restaurant not only poses a health hazard to others but also increases the risk of a fire outbreak within the establishment. Additionally, this creates a negative impression for other customers regarding the restaurant's atmosphere. It's important to note that the odor of cigarettes can have a negative impact on the overall dining experience by affecting the aroma of food and potentially causing a loss of appetite.  

Every individual who visits a restaurant must be able to enjoy their meal in a smoke-free environment. To ensure that this is achieved, it is imperative that smoking be banned in all restaurants. This will enable all customers to enjoy their dining experience without being exposed to any harmful secondhand smoke.
