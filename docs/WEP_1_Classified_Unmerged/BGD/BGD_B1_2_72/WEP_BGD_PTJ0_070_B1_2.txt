  Yes I completely agree about the fact that college students should have a part time job. Part time jobs are those  work which we, the students can do in our free time and earn money. Many college students around the world is currently working part time and also continuing their studies at college. Students can learn about the real life experience while doing these part time jobs.

In Bangladesh the scenario of part time for college student is very rare. In our country we can see the highest number of college students are spending their time working on their academics but not on skill they can learn by doing part time jobs. Part time job maybe of several types like working as an assistant or working at IT sector/multinational companies or even working as a waiter at resturants. But we see the student of our country only try for tutoring sectors.

Part time jobs help us earn money. Instead of asking for money from our parents we can work on our free time and earn money. The hard earned money will give the college students a lesson about the importance of money.

These days we see many students are spending their time on many bad activities like drugs so if the college students remain busy at work they will get rid of their bad activities. Besides many family are unable to pay the college fees. So if the students work they can pay almost half or more of their tuition fees. Therefore college students should try to work besides their studies.
