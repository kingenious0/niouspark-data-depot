Yes, I agree with the statement. Smoking is already known as a bad habit. Smoking causes many incurable diseases such as cancer, bronchitis, asthma etc. People see smokers from negative perspectives. And when someone is openly smoking in a café or a restaurant, it causes inconvenience for the surrounding other customers. The other people who are consuming the smoke coming from cigarette feel uncomfortable. Sometimes, people in restaurants feel so uncomfortable to the point that they leave the place. Thus, some restaurant authorities prohibit smoking inside the restaurant. Smoking inside cafes or restaurants is inconvenient to the consumers. Though some restaurants have separate smoking zone these days. People who smoke use the smoking zone in those restaurants. This causes less inconvenience for the other consumers. But when all the tables of non-smoking zone are booked, some stubborn customers use the smoking-zone. And so, they have to consume the smoke. But when customers smoke in a restaurant without separate smoking zone, the other customers become bothered, feel uncomfortable. Children or any customer having asthma can have difficulty breathing due to the smoke. Again, some customer being annoyed can make complains against the smoker. Sometimes, teenage customers can be interested in smoking if they see someone doing so. For these reasons, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country.
