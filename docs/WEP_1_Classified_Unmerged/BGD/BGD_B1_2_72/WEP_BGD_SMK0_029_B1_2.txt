 
The topic of banning smoking in all restaurants across the country has two sides to it. Some people argue that a complete ban is crucial for public health. Others believe that individual rights should be considered and other alternative solutions should be implemented.

A complete smoking ban in restaurants is important to protect the public health and the well-being of customers and employees. Secondhand smoke can cause irritation and health problems to people who are simply bystanders. By implementing a comprehensive ban, restaurants can create a safer and friendlier environment for all.

On the other hand, the argument can be made that this violates personal freedom and opinion. Restaurant owners themselves should have the freedom to decide whether to allow smoking in their premises, and the customers can choose whether or not to visit the smoking zones in restaurants based on their preferences. Maybe it can be a better idea to have designated smoking and non-smoking zones within restaurants. That way, it provides the best of both worlds for all parties. There can also be other methods to solve this problem. Implementing stricter ventilation systems or designated outdoor smoking areas can help reduce the impact of secondhand smoke while still allowing freedom of choice.

In conclusion, the topic of a complete smoking ban in all restaurants generates strong arguments from both sides. While protecting public health can be important, it is important to keep individual rights in mind and come up with less drastic solutions. Implementing measures such as designated smoking zones or improved ventilation systems can provide a compromises that reduces the problem while respecting individuals who make the choice to smoke.
