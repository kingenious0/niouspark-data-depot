 In today's world, experience is what every employer is looking for. The students understand the importance of experience in job sector which is why they are very interested in taking part time jobs. There are lots of advantage for taking a part time job for students. They can earn extra pocket money, utilize time productively, develop interpersonal skill, helping build professional network etc. However, a student might get exhausted and will not have leisure time nor have time to study peacefully. Nevertheless, I think it has more positive effects than negative.

As students start working, they gain extra pocket money to fulfill their basic necessity in daily life and gain huge confidence an experience too which will have a positive effect when they will fully contribute their time to their career. Moreover, with this experience they will get better job opportunity. A student will understand the importance of using time productively as well as he or she has to divide time into a lot of segments so that they can get things done in a whole day. Furthermore, meeting diverse and people with different personality, The students will develop interpersonal skills. There would be respect for a different culture at workplace. It will also help to grow communication skills which will increase their demand in job sector.

Therefore, I agree that students should do part time jobs to gain confidence and to have backup income being a student.
