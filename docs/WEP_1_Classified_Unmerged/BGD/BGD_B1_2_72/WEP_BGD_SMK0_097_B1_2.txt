 Smoking has been an outrageous concern for decades and its harmful impacts on both smokers and non-smokers are well-known. Nowadays, public health concerns are rising and so the government is planning on taking certain steps to evacuate smoking from several public spots. Restaurants are one of the most scattered places for smoking nowadays and certain aspects say that smoking should be banned at all restaurants.
First of all, banning smoking would protect the well-being of not only smokers but also non-smokers since the polluted smoke won't be inhaled by humans anymore. Furthermore, some people visit restaurants for good ambiance, i.e. they may not want to take their children to such restaurants where people would smoke and so this becomes a down effect on the restaurant sales as well.
Secondly, smoking bans also come up with a lot of economic benefits. This would help lower healthcare costs, as fewer people would suffer from smoking-related diseases. A smoke-free environment would attract more customers which might help in generating more revenue. 
However, smoking bans might refrain a particular segment of young people from coming into restaurants because some of the individuals might not be bothered about health concerns rather they may just want to come with a circle of friends when seeking a place of smoking facilities. Also, some individuals might claim to have the right of making their own decisions, even if it impacts others negatively.
In conclusion, I believe that smoking bans could help influence people to leave this habit when they'll be in a situation where smoking is prohibited. As a result, taking this step would create a choice towards a healthier and safer society.
