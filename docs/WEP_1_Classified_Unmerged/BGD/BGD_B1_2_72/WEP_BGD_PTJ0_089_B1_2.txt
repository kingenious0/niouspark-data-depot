  While students should be allowed the space and time to study or have a social life outside of college or University, it is also quite important for them to take on the responsibilities of having a job. Starting a job at an early age not only will help their career by allowing them to find better job opportunities as companies look for experience over everything. Granted, not all of us want to climb the ladder at a corporate job, it is still important to learn about the environment of a proper workplace or even enhance your skills and learn about your assets and weaknesses.  Some students, like myself do not like having to rely on their parents for all of their financial needs, having even a minimum wage job can help us be less of a financial burden, especially in this day and age where it is extremely easy to start somewhere, whether it is an online clothing store or being a tutor for kids, there are endless simple ways a student can make money. However, one big downside to earning money as a student is that making money can be addictive and students might lose focus on their studies and simply start to concentrate on making more. It is possible to have a balance even as a student, especially with a simple part time job.
