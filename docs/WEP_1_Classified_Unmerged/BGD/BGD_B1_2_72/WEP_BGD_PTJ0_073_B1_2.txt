I agree with the above statement. Even though, it can be debatable but from my perspective a student should avail a part-time job if they can manage to balance other important aspects of their life such as academics and the bare minimum amount of social commitment to entities such as family, friends etc and to work on self-care/self-improvement for a healthy lifestyle. As real-life practical job scenarios will offer a better understanding on how the job sector operates, it will help a student with the information on how to work on themselves so that they can cater themselves to have the certain qualities and attributes an ideal job candidate should have in order to get access to better job opportunities by the time they graduate. Good part-time job/internship opportunities are a very good source to network with valuable people and make meaningful relationships that can be of profitable use. Another important factor is the ability to have financial independence from Job opportunities even though the amount may not be that significant. Some important factors that need to be noted are, one should only go for a part-time job opportunity if they can balance every other crucial factor in their life and without hampering them. Because as much as jobs need commitment academics need proportional commitment as well so one should make use of their time and energy wisely. If one can balance it properly then I think given their performance they can improve drastically and can avail significantly valuable assets that are demanded by our society and culture.
