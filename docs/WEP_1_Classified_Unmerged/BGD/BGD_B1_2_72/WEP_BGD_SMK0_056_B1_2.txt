 Smoking has been considered a health hazard in most advanced countries, not only for the smoker but also for others who have to inhale second-hand smoke. Smoking is a major cause of lung cancer and creates complications in treating some other major illnesses, like, diabetes and heart problems. 
In most of our restaurants, the ventilation system is not great, if at all present. I agree that some modern and expensive restaurants have good air conditioning which may alleviate some of the smoke accumulation problems. But a great majority of the restaurants are catering to common people and such have practically no ventilation system at all. Smoking in those restaurants will accumulate second-hand smoke and adversely affect non-smokers. That's why, without making any distinctions, most developed countries have banned smoking in public places and also outside within 10 meters of the place.
Some may argue that the restaurants would not get clients as many people still smoke. However, studies in some countries, as well as practical outcomes, indicate that people gradually adopt the new behaviour within restaurants. For example, in Canada, when smoking was banned in pubs and casinos, the owners predicted that their businesses would fail as smokers would stay away. This outcome did not happen. Of course, one could say that two other vices, drinking and gambling were much too attractive to stay away from! However, in the same manner, our people, poor or rich just cannot stay away from the restaurants. Not being able to smoke there would also help those who really want to kick the habit.
Therefore, considering the pros and cons, I firmly believe that banning smoking from all restaurants will ultimately be beneficial for non-smokers as well as those smokers who want to quit but haven't the firm resolve to do so.
