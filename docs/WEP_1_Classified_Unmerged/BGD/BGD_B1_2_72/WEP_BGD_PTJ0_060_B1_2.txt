Yes! I agree with this statement. Generally, most of the students from any college in Bangladesh are studying using their parent's money. Which is one of the main reasons why students don't understand the value of money. Students need to understand the value of money and one of the best ways to learn that is by earning money themselves. And part-time job plays a significant role in this. It shows them the value of money and how hard it is to earn and manage money. It helps students by making them financially independent and students can save some money for themselves for the future. By understanding the value of money they learn how to manage money as well as how to save money. This also helps them to understand what is their needs, wants and demands. It also takes a lot of load from the family members of that student. But In Bangladesh, unfortunately the term part-time job is viewed negatively. Almost all parents and relatives don't view part-time job as a good thing. Here students are not encouraged to do a part-time job. Which is why majority of the students are not even thinking about doing a part-time job. And the minority of students who want to do a part-time job feels ashamed to do it. That's why it is very important for parents as well as teachers to teach students about the value of money and encourage them to do a part-time job.
