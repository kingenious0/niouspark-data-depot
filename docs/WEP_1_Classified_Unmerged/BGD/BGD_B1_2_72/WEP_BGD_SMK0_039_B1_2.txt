 Banning smoking completely in all restaurants have both sides.
The good part is about health. It isn't unknown to anyone that smoking is injurious to health. Smoking is harmful not only for the smoker himself but also the people around him, the harm exponentially increases when it is done in a closed environment. So, if one person is stopped from smoking in a restaurant, which is mostly situated in a closed environment it will save many people from getting potential health hazards. 
Now let's talk about the negative sides. Firstly, as it will reduce the number of the cigars consumed, it will reduce the government's high earning from its tax, it will also reduce the cigar manufacturer's profit due to less quantities sold, the company even might cuttle its workers too. So it has a negative impact on the economy primarily. Then, smoking is nothing illegal, it is basically one's personal choice. So if one is stopped from smoking in a restaurant, it is basically harming his personal space, personal freedom. 
So, is there a way to minimize the negative sides while maximizing poaitives? Yes, there is. The simplest solution is to create dedicated smoking zones in restaurants which will be beneficial for all the parties involved.
