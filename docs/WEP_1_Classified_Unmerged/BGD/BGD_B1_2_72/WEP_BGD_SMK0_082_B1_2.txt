 
Yes, I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country.
Smoking prohibition in restaurants will improve public health. Many families with young children go to these restaurants. However, it will have negative impacts on children. Smoking will be very disturbing and inconvenient for the non-smokers at the restaurants. Restaurants owners have many smoking customers. Hence, they do not forbid smoking there. Smokers would undoubtedly spend less money at restaurants. If they learned that smoking is prohibited there, which would hurt both the restaurant industry and the overall economy. But smoking ban in restaurants is an essential move for the sake of the public health. 
Everyone is aware of the adverse effects smoking has on one's health. Lung cancer and respiratory issues are brought on by smoking. Smokers won't stop smoking, but there needs to be a private area where they can do so. Additionally, there are a lot of customers who are concerned about their health. Therefore, smoking near them will be harmful for them. Smokers endanger not only themselves but also other customers in restaurants. Without a doubt, restrictions could impact some businesses income levels. But the majority of the customers at the restaurants are non-smokers. 
We could conclude by saying that it is essential to ban smoking in all restaurants in our country.
