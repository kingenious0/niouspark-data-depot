  Smoking is injurious to health  this is what we see on packets of cigarettes, which is true. People who smoke should not do it in public places such as parks, beaches, local buses, trains etc. In short, they should not smoke around people who do not smoke, because smokers are risking others' lives including their own. But in restaurants the scenario is different. I do not support the idea of banning smoking in restaurants. 

Now a days restaurant is the place where we see most of the people spending their quality time with their friends and family. Now it is impossible that no one from that friend circle or family do not smoke, because here in Bangladesh 35% of its population is smoking cigarettes on daily basis. This is where restaurants did an amazing job, which is they came up with smoking zones. Smoking zone is a particular room or a corner of the restaurant which is covered with thick Thai glasses or bricks. It is usually a place where smokers can smoke without causing harm to any other people who do not smoke. 

There are so many people who do not smoke, but they breathe into that poisonous smoke which comes from their friends or uncles' cigarettes. This life taking smoke makes people sick and sometimes they cause diseases like asthma. But because of these restaurants and their smoking zones, smokers are now smoking away from others and not causing any social crime by smoking in public places. Though some people are still smoking in local places but the rate of that has decreased because of restaurants. Restaurants are helping to balance the number of local smokers.
