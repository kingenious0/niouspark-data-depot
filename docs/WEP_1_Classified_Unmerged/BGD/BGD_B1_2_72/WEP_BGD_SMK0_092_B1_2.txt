 I completely agree with the fact that smoking should be banned from all the restaurants of the country. It is because restaurant is a public place and smoking in restaurants hampers the overall environment.
 When a person smokes in a restaurant openly, the people around him are also get affected by the smoke which is being produced by him through smoking. As a result, these people might get affected by diseases like cancer, respiratory infection, hearth attack etc. for which they are not even responsible. Study shows that the people with secondhand smoking are getting more affected than the actual smokers. So, to save these innocent people we must prevent smoking at any cost.
 When smoking is banned in a restaurant, the smokers will feel hesitation to smoke. They will feel that smoking is not normal everywhere. Their sense of responsibility or even self-respect may arise. So, in this way their habit of smoking will reduce eventually.
 Some people may feel that smoking is their right and banning smoking is restricting their right. In this case, the restaurants may create a separate space for smoking, from where no smoke comes to the main area of the restaurant. 
 In conclusion, I will say that smoking should be banned in all the public places, not only in restaurants. The innocents should not suffer for the deed of the smokers.
