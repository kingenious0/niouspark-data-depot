 Smoking is widely acknowledged as a severe public health issue. Day by day, the number of smokers is increasing. However, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. 
Passive smoking is a big concern in a restaurant. Since most restaurants are not open-air based, smoking inside those restaurants leads to passive smoking.  Passive smoking is very harmful to our bodies, unlike active smoking. Several studies showed that being affected by passive smoking raises the chance of severe diseases like lung cancer, coronary artery disease, and breathing problems. Restaurants should be viewed as enjoyable places where consumers can eat without harming their health. Restaurants that allow smoking exposes non-smokers to the dangers of passive smoking and make the atmosphere unpleasant for people who don't smoke. According to economists, restaurants that do not allow smoking do not face any business loss. Smoke-free environments draw more customers, including non-smokers who may have walked back from dining in places where smoking is permitted.
A complete ban on smoking in all restaurants is necessary to ensure public health. The restaurant owners should know the customers' satisfaction and take the required step to build an enjoyable and safe environment. Moreover, the Government should make a strict law to ban smoking in every restaurant.
