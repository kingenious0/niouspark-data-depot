 Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country-yes, I am completely agreeing with this statement.
Smoking is very dangerous for the human body. But day by day it's just increasing. People are forgetting their morals. now most people start smoking anywhere at any time. they don't care about the environment or the people around them. if one person is smoking the people around that person is also affected in many ways. Nowadays some restaurants have a corner for people to smoke like a smoking zone or smoking corner. but where there is no such corner for smokers' problems happen the most.in restaurants, we usually go for enjoying our food or to take our meal. but nowadays people publicly smoke in a restaurant. whether it is an open space or in a room they don't care about the surroundings. there are special kids and old people who suffer the most in this case. the air gets polluted so much. Even the smell of nicotine can also mix with your food so in that case you will not be able to eat your food properly. Those who are non-smokers feel so much suffocation.
So, especially in restaurants, there should be strict rules for smokers. then all types of people will enjoy their meal in a good healthy way. So, Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country as soon as possible.
