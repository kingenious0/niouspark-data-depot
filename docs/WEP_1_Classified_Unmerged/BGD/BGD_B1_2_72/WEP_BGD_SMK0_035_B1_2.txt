I agree that smoking should be banned from all restaurants across the country. The reason I came to this conclusion has to do with the effect of secondhand smoke. Someone who smokes is decreasing their life span also as the smoked exhale is toxic he or she is also affecting others around them or without realizing it. Research shows the terrifying truth that second-hand smoke or inhaling the smoke that is being exhaled by someone who is smoking can lead to cancer. A restaurant is a place where we go just to eat or spend quality time with our family. There can be children, elderly people, or a nonsmoker in the restaurant by smoking in that restaurant we are putting those people at risk of cancer and other disease. To stop this we could ban smoking from restaurants so that we can spend quality time with our loved ones. In bangladesh more then 50% of the polulation is addicted to smoking ciggrate so it is diffucult to ban smoking from the resturent. If it is difficult to do so then restaurant owners should at least create a separate space (smoking zone) for the customers who want to smoke so that their poor choice or lack of situational awareness would not affect people around them.
