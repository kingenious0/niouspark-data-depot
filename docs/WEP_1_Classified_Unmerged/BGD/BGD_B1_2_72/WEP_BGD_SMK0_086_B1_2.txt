 No,I do not agree with the fact that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.Smoking should be obviously banned in the dining area, but outside that, a designated spot for smoking shouldn't be a problem to others staying in the dining space.

Smoking is a very controversial topic.The hesitation,discomfort and hatred towards smoking are connected drastically with the social norms than its actual dangers to both the human body and the environment.Smoking is more like a personal preference. It is undoubtedly injurious to health and many advertisements, seminars and campaigns are hosted for making people aware of its harmful effects. Even the packet of cigarettes holds images of severe health problems caused by smoking.But still, some people choose to do it on their own accord,which might or might not seem normal to the general people. So it's an imposition to tell them not to smoke.

However, people who smoke should be sensible enough to not make the people around them uncomfortable by their smoking, they should politely find a place where they don't disturb anyone.If smoking is banned at all the restaurants totally, it might result into a much bigger problem than smoking itself.For example,even after being banned, some people might still continue smoking in the washroom or the staircase.This creates a far more uncomfortable situation for the guests and ruins the reputation of the place.
Thus it is better to create a small designated space for people who smoke,outside or a bit distant from the dining hall, for creating a favorable environment for everyone visiting the restaurant.
