I strongly agree.

Restaurants are places where one can visit, sit and enjoy a jolly time with friends and family or just sit with themselves and enjoy the food. It is a place that serves us food while we spend moments with our loved ones. Having to smell smoke coming from cigarettes or vapes while we spend good moments should not be something tolerable.

Smoking is injurious to health, yet it is not banned completely. But one lacks the decency to smoke in restaurants and cafes. One should always remember to leave the harming factors behind and enter places where children might be present. It is just a matter of good behaviour and common decency. 

Moreover, our country Bangladesh does not possess any rules or restrictions behind smokers or public smoking, unlike many countries that take steps regarding such issues and maintain it thoroughly. However, in a country where decency is still alive, one expects citizens to behave properly when visiting the same place as families and friends. Although, it is required to take steps to ban smoking, especially publicly, as smoking does contain harmful substances that don't only affect the one smoking but also the one who is inhaling the damaging components residing in the smoke. Therefore, I unarguably agree that smoking should be dismissed completely at all restaurants in the country for valid reasons.
