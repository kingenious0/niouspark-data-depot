Smoking has become a very harmful habit nowadays. People know how bad smoking is for their health but still they do it. Nowadays we see people smoking even in restaurants. Not all restaurants allow smoking but some restaurants do. Especially in some big restaurants in our country, smoking is prohibited. And in my opinion, people should have this freedom. But of course, no one's problem like they can have a separate smoking room in the restaurant so that smokers can go there to smoke. Meanwhile, there must be a separate seating area for the common people who are there who don't like to smoke exclusively. According to me, smoking is a personal choice of people so if someone wants to smoke in a restaurant then he can go to a separate room to smoke. He should have this freedom. If someone wants to smoke in a restaurant and the restaurant has the capability to afford a separate room, then it will be okay for everyone. Finally, I can say that instead of banning smoking in restaurants, there should be a separate room for smokers where they can sit and smoke and of course, they should make sure that it is not a problem for common people.
