 Nowadays smoking is more likely a fashionable thing for young people. I agree with the fact that smoking at restaurants and other public places should be completely illegal. In this essay, I will discuss and give you some valid points about why this should be banned.

To begin with, Smoking is injurious to health. It can create dangerous health issues. Smoking affects not only the smoker but also the nearby people. Passive smoking is a proven health hazard, passive smokers can suffer from respiratory problems, heart disease, and even cancer. By enforcing a ban, we create a healthier dining environment, ensuring that non-smokers are not exposed to harmful smoke against their will.

Second, passive smoking has very hazardous health effects on children and young people. Smoking should not be introduced to children while they are still developing. Additionally, a smoke-free society will be promoted and a good example will be established for the younger generation by prohibiting smoking in restaurants. Additionally, with safer working conditions, restaurant employees who are frequently exposed to secondhand smoke will have fewer health hazards. Thirdly, smoking in restaurants contributes to environmental damage in addition to health problems. One of the most frequently found littered items is cigarette filters, which release hazardous compounds into the air, water, and soil, harming ecosystems and wildlife.

In conclusion, we can say that a ban on smoking at all restaurants in the country would be a brilliant decision. By doing this we can safeguard public health and promote environmental sustainability.
