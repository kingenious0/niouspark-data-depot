 
A part-time job makes a student financially independent, which leads them to be more conscious about the rightful use of money, time and skill. I agree with the statement that a part-time job is important for a student. 

 It is an opportunity where one can work for five to six hours daily or on specific days of the week. It is highly recommended for college or university students, as they have reached the age where they have started to prepare themselves for the challenges, they will face in the process of becoming an excellent human being and having a successful career.   

As a student myself, I come across a few situations of needing money for my projects or outings with friends, times like this I feel shy and embarrassed to ask for money from my parents. These situations made me understand that earning your own money is important. This is where part-time jobs help the most. It does not only help you to gain more independence but also to learn about real life skills, like – communicating with people, teamwork, coming up with quick solutions to various work-related problems, planning and organizing etc. These skills are important for everyone who wants to have a successful and peaceful life. A part-time job also helps a student to create their own personality and learn about new things all the time. It teaches a student to be more organized about their thoughts and work. Part-time job can be anything, like – working at a café or a restaurant, helping as a teaching assistant, doing freelance work for companies or designers and so on.  

Students are always eager to learn new skills and experience. A part-time job is the right place to find their passion and get ready for future challenges. It is a pathway to becoming a self-dependent person.
