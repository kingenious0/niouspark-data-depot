I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking is responsible for more than 1,300 deaths every day. So, it is clearly not a good habit. Allowing designated smoking areas in restaurants can unintentionally make smokers feel important, which encourages the habit. It also lets cigarette companies advertise their products unethically.
Restaurants are places where people of all ages go, including children. Seeing someone smoke might influence them in a bad way. Non-smokers have the right to breathe clean air, but smoking zones make them uncomfortable.
If restaurants stop having smoking zones, it could help smokers quit. If it's absolutely necessary to have smoking areas, they should be outdoors, away from the main dining section.
More importantly, such a ban would create a sense of community well-being as it reflects a collective effort to prioritize public health over individual preferences. It shows that as a society we value the health and comfort of all individuals, and we are willing to take necessary steps to protect everyone from the harmful effects of smoking.
Therefore, banning smoking in all restaurants is vital for public health and making sure everyone can enjoy their meals in a smoke-free environment. It encourages smokers to quit and protects non-smokers from harmful secondhand smoke.
