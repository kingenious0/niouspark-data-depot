Yes, I agree with the statement. Generally, most of the college students are above 18 and have reached their youth. At this very stage, they want to be independent.  Except for the expenses for which they have to depend on their parents, students try to carry out their daily expenses by themselves. For example, when they need to buy some stationaries or want to go out with their friends, they tend to dislike asking money from their parents. Because this would hurt their pride. And so, students in college try to get part-time jobs alongside their studies.In part-time jobs, students have to work for half shift and can get to choose the time of the job by their preferences. When it comes to the variations, there are many types of part-time jobs. Such as, freelancing, working in cafes or restaurants, working as salesman or saleswoman, part-time editor in publishing companies, communicating with customers in online businesses and even running online businesses etc. These jobs not only help the students to earn money  but also help them to gain experiences about work life. Students can bear their daily expenses with the salary they get from the jobs. Even students can save up for future from their leftover salaries. Again, if any student's family is in tight position due to financial problem, he/she can support his/her family by doing part-time jobs. Therefore, it is important for a college student to have a part-time job regardless of coming from a wealthy or a poverty-stricken family.
