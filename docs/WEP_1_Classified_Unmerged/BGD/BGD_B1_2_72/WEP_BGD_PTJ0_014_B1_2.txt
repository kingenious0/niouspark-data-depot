I agree that it's important for college students to have a part time job because part time job is a best way to learn how to manage time in order to keep plans, school programs and work schedules organised and to force them to keep a steady schedule. Many students work part time to earn money to fund their studies and to make their lives more free and more financially satisfied. . Some kids whose families can't supply their education fees with adequate money actually need money to supplement their studies and support their families. Others use their money to buy, instead of depending on the subsidies of their parents, on their own wishes. Working throughout studies appears to be a complete drag. Another advantage of part time job is that its future career is supported in particular by the major students. Students can practice theory they have learnt in class when they are working. This enables children to not only recall and understand lessons more fully but inspires them to study and realize exactly what is important. On the other hand, part-time employment provides a lot of trust, opportunity to learn about responsibility, teamwork – qualities highly important for the work. Because of part time job , students develop their time management abilities by balancing so many responsibilities. Students are usually organized and efficient to plan ahead to make sure that everything fits in the short time you spend. Another perk of part-time work is Regardless of where you work, you may network with other individuals through a part-time employment. So, even if you don't have expertise in a sector you wish to follow, in the professional world you still make contacts.
