 Smoking is something which is mostly viewed negatively but for some it's their coping method. It's something people do out of curiosity or being influenced by friends/ society. But it is something which is equally harmful for the one who's smoking and whoever is around them. That's why it should be totally banned from all the restaurants in the country in my opinion.

Smoking has infinite harmful effects on the actual smoker and the people surrounding them. It causes so many serious health conditions such as stroke, lung cancer, heart diseases etc. 

Restaurant is somewhere people often visit with their loved ones. So when someone is smoking in a restaurant it means they're putting their loved ones in danger of serious health risks. The smoke which comes out of a cigarette is heavy and spreads slowly. The slower it spreads the longer it's around people. 

A ban of smoking in restaurants can encourage a group of smokers to quit smoking as it is so harmful for not only them but the people around them. It will create a better environment for future generations and people will less likely to get serious health conditions. 

That's why I agree strongly with the fact that smoking should be completely banned in all the restaurants in the country.
