               I agree that college students should have a part-time job. We are studying so that we graduate in our chosen subjects with good grades. But ultimately, we want to work in the real world. In our own specialty area, we want a good job and do well in it so that we may prosper. However, in most jobs, we must deal with the public, our colleagues, and our juniors and supervisors. If we only have book learning, we miss out on the application of our skills to the target population. By doing a part-time job, we get the great opportunity to apply our knowledge and skills as we are learning them under an academic background. It makes us understand the relevance of what we learn. By doing a part-time job, no matter where it is, we meet with real people and learn how to deal with various situations that may arise. We can then apply what we learn in our classrooms. In our country, it is more important because we may have to deal with a cross-section of the population. A part-time job will also help those students who are not as financially well off as some others. It will give them a sense of dignity, accomplishments, and valuable experience. Then, why should a student not do a part-time job if he or she is able and offered a suitable job. The one thing that we should also remember is that a part-time job is only possible if the student can cope with an educational workload. If not, it's not in the student's interest to take a part-time job. 
            Therefore, I conclude t when a student can carry the studies workload and a suitable part-time job is offered, accepting the job is in the best interest of the student.
