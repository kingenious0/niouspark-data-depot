I agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country. Smoking being harmful is not the reason, but it is concerning because non-smokers, kids, and sick people might be harmed by it. Smoking zones do not help a lot. We can easily detect that there is heavy smoking going on around us. When people get out of the zone, anyone can smell it and become uncomfortable. In restaurants, people come to try out new dishes, items, and offers and have a relaxing time with their friends, partners, and loved ones. I do not see any reason why there should even be smoking in a restaurant in the first place. Trying out new food is a heavenly feeling for a food lover. And in a city, people often visit restaurants just for a get-together with their friends. Smoking should not get in the way of a beautiful moment. Smokers need restaurants to smoke; there are thousands of places for it. Most importantly, restaurants are for all kinds of people. There might be people who have trouble breathing, are dealing with mild sickness, are allergic to smoke smells, etc. Smokers should not have the right to make their smoking habit a priority and ruin their time.
