First of all, smoking is harmful to health. Smokers also suffer from other diseases such as tuberculosis and heart disease. Symptoms may take a while to appear, but eventually lead to a serious crisis. It affects not only the smoker, but also those around him. Both active and passive smokers can get sick, so a total ban on smoking in public places needs strong support. Second, smoking is an addiction that also affects non-smokers. Anything addictive is not safe and tends to spread quickly. The influence of peers and peer groups is common in the formation of smoking habits. It's easy to start smoking when you're a long-term smoker. People spend a lot of time in public places, so smoking in public places should be banned to avoid this negative effect. Finally, among smokers, non-smokers feel stressed. Pregnant women, the elderly and children have difficulty adjusting to an environment filled with cigarette smoke. It can irritate non-smokers of all ages. Smoking in public places should be banned as it causes a serious nuisance. In my opinion, there should be some smoking areas in the common areas. Bus stops, shopping centers, restaurants and offices must have separate smoking areas so addicted smokers are not influenced or disadvantaged.
