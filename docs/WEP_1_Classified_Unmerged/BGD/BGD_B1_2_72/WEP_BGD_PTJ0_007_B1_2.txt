 I totally agreed with the following statement that it is important for college students to have a part time job. It helps the students to become responsible.
I truly believe that being a student there is no wrong in doing a part-time job. Those students who hold part time jobs have learned time management skills. Working in a structured job, it will push them to organize their life. It will also make them flexible. It will also motivate the students to finish the work early.
Most of the students, they want to do part-time job. The reason behind is to earn some money. Having a part time job can help a student to pay for college, pay for rent and contribute for family expenses.
Working a part time job will help a student to gain new skills. During the job, he/she must communicate with many people that will help them to improve their communication skill. It will also create an opportunity for the students to gain work life experience. 
In a part time job, students are allowed to try different tasks which might help them to find their passion. Having a part time job might help the college students in future. As the will have work experience, so they will get any job earlier.
