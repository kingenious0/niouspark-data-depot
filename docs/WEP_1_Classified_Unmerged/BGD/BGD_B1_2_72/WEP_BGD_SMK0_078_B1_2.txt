 It can be an argumentative issue to discuss on if smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country or not.
If we look at it from a moral point of view, it is utterly wrong to smoke in a public restaurant where people come to spend their time with their beloved ones. And the smoke can be extremely disturbing for those people and let's not forget how harmful it can be for health.
On the other hand, from the marketing mindset, if we can manage an extra 'smoking zone' for the smokers, not just regular people but also the other people will go to that restaurant. Thus it will increase their customer engagement for both party with respect. And no one will be disturbed by the other party. 
It is a matter of fact that smoking will never be banned because of the market value it created in economy for years. Preventing something which is nearly impossible to do so is a waste of time and effort. Rather with strategic mindset we can take necessary and strict rules to make people understand and respect the other party with absolute decency.
Since smoking helps growing the economy and kills our lungs at the same time, we can try to help both party through a few arrangements. That's what I believe about banning smoking.
