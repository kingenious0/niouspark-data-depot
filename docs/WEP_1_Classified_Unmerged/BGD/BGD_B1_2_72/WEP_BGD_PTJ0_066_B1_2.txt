 In this period of inflation, students need part time jobs so that they can earn money for their expenses. I strongly agree with this notion and provide my overall opinion in further paragraphs with a suitable conclusion.
Supporting my agreement or disagreement with the given statement, I firmly believe that students have to do part time jobs for their life. It not only helps them to earn money but also helps them to have various experiences which are very much needed for their future. For Instance, nowadays, companies want experience with academic scores. Students don't get a job if they don't have any kind of experience in their sector. Moreover, there are many students in our country who don't have enough money for their education. If the government ensures part time job facilities for those students, then they can easily lead their life
Explaining some of the another supporting points, it is true that part time job is essential for student because it helps them to become more independent. They can implement their educational knowledge in this job and become more practical people. This practical knowledge will help them in future when they have to do work in professional life. Furthermore, students who have part-time jobs can earn their own pocket money on their own and build good networks which will help them in future.
In conclusion, students should do part time jobs and gather experience for the future. I believe that the aforementioned points are strongly supporting my viewpoint.
