Smoking should be completely banned at the restaurants in the country and I completely agree with that. We all know that smoking is injurious to health. If a person smokes it not only affects his/her health but also affects the people surround him. In Dhaka there is a vast amounts of restaurant and there is a smoking zone, many people go to the restaurant for smoking. Many child and young see that and it become curiosity to their minds. They started to do smoking because of their curiosity. Smoking not only affects his/her health but also disturbs the whole environment. There is nothing advantages about it. Smoking should be completely banned in the restaurants it will maintain health cautions in restaurant. A smoker brings a bad odor in the restaurant which discomforts the consumers.  Some people are allergic to smoke and when they come to restaurant with their family for refreshment and when the smokers smoking in the restaurant it will bring bad impacts to their family and children. Not only that smoking also harms the pregnant women and their unborn child. Some people only comes to the restaurant for smoking and they dont order anything. It impacts the economy of the restaurant. So we should create awarness about smoking in restaurant as it ony creates bad images and discomforts the non smoking consumers. Smoking at any public place has impact on others and hampers their without even their knowing. So im strictly against the smoking in restaurants.
