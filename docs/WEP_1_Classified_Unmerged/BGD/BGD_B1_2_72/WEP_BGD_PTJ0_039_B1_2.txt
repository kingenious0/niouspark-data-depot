 There are a few things that need to be considered before commenting on this topic. They are- the student's goal, financial condition, academic pressure, preference.
Firstly, we have to know the specific student's goal. If they want to achieve higher academic excellence, they might not get enough opportunity because of the job, or they might become so tired that they cannot focus on studies. In this case, its better to avoid parttime jobs.
Secondly, the financial condition of the student. If the student is poor, having hard times filling up his basic needs, he might consider doing so called odd jobs.
Then we have academic pressure. If the college or the subject he studies in gives him too much pressure or requires too much dedication, its advisable for him not to engage in any part time job. 
Preference, it is indeed the most important scale. If he wants to pass his pastime this way, if he wants to learn things this way, if he wants to havehiw own money, then he definitely can and should get himself a parttime job.
Therefore, we can say that it can't be a general comment that the student should do parttime jobs or not.It varies from student to student.
