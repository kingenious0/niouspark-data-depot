I disagree for the unnecessary of having a part time job among students. The reason why, students will spend less time on their studies , also students might not give their complete focus on the study , rather than they will be more encourage to earn more money. At a sudden period, they might plan to drop their study and plan to start their own startup. The power of money at this young age may divert them into dark sides, such as, drugs, parties and many more things. Moreover, part time job will not give any job security, nor any employee benefits, and it will be an unaccounted experience, often ignored by recruiters and headhunters, and most importantly it is difficult in measuring working hours. Another reason for disagreeing part time job for college students, it might cause physical and mental health issues, it will be more pressure for a student to lead their daily life and study. They even get sick from poor immune system due to lack of sleep or overwork. However, we always need to take care of our self, our health is our main priority , we have to make sure we eat right and get enough sleep, importantly we all need to take a break if things got to stressful.
