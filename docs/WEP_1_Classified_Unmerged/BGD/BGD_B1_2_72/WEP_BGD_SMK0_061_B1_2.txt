Smoking is injurious to health and it is known to everyone. Smoking in a public place should not be done. But i think smoking should not be banned in every restaurant in the country.  If it happens, people will smoke outside in public places, smokers will suffer to find a place to smoke and a negative  impact will be on the environment.

Many restaurants have smoking zone. People who smoke regularly can go there to smoke, otherwise they have to smoke outside, which is not good for the public. 

It is not possible to quit smoking easily. So for them, it is necessary to have an open place at restaurants so that other customers can  enjoy their respective time. If they do not find any proper place to smoke, they may smoke at home, which is unhealthy for their family members. 

Again, it is not good for the environment if anyone smokes outside or in any public place. It is pathetic for non-smokers, children, pregnant women and senior citizens.

So I think it is necessary to have a smoking zone at restaurants. If it is totally banned, all will suffer simultaneously. The environment also has to suffer because of this. We should work on how to make people aware of the dangers of smoking instead of banning the smoking zone at restaurants.
