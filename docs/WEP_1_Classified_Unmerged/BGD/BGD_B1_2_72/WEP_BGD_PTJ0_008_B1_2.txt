I agree but partially.

College life is one of the most critical moments in our lives that we will forever remember. It teaches us the value of hard work, maintaining relationships and aiming higher. Although it is crucial, it is also the time of our lives when we prepare for life when we start earning income for our journey of adulthood.

I am a 1st-year student of my university, and getting a job would significantly help me in numerous aspects. But, on the other hand, I believe that a student should settle down first, get used to the way the organisation works in his/her college and then, if wished, should start looking out for a job as that helps the student get used to a new life.

Indeed, a part-time job helps a student, particularly in factors like buying usual stationeries or hanging out with friends in between class breaks, and even contributes to the transportation from home to the institute and then back home. These minor things don't necessarily need a parent's income to be fulfilled. Therefore, I would definitely agree with the importance of a part-time job in a college/university student's life.
