 Part- time job is a form of work arrangement that involves fewer hours than a full- time position. Most students in Bangladesh grow up seeing the norm of studying at least to the point of graduation, go in for job hunting, land a job after much effort. To acquire work experience, I believe it's important for college students to have a part-time job in addition to their studies. 
Compared to other economically developed countries, student-friendly part-time jobs are still uncommon in our country.  Our parents sometimes end up saying,  Just focus on studying, we will bear your finances . However, gaining work experience while in college is precisely not about achieving financial independence. There are myriad reasons to start part- time jobs as college goers. We can combine our class schedules and come in shifts while getting practical workplace knowledge.  Working part-time enables students to develop skills including leadership, time management, decision-making, flexibility, and communication. Tutoring is one of the work opportunities available to college students. Additionally, one can determine what their career calling is. Nowadays, freelancing is a wonderful side hustle because it allows us to determine our own work hours while earning a decent pay. 
Part-time jobs work for many students, although it's not suitable for everyone. While it can help some students thrive, it can also cause significant difficulties for others. Juggling academics with part-time work may take a toll on one's mental health. 
In conclusion, college students can take on various part-time jobs to learn life lessons and career skills that they would not have learned in college. Thus, in my opinion, it's essential for college students to work part- time while maintaining mental health and keeping study a top priority.
