 I do agree that it is important for college students to have a part time job. 
As we grow up we try to be less dependent on our parents. Because asking for financial help aside from the academics feels like a burden when we are capable of making money on our own through our talents. 
But most importantly, having a part time job gives us the real world experience of struggle and hard work. We learn how to build communication and network, how to fulfill responsibilities within a certain period of time, leadership requirements, need of improving soft skills and more. All of these can be experienced prior to the graduation. Therefore after graduation, students have less chances of failures since they have already worked in youth organizations, profit or non- profit organizations in their student life.
I believe it's quite difficult to succeed or even survive in a world with so many talented, passionate and dedicated people who know how to achieve their goals. So, having a part time job isn't just about money. It's way more than that. It's about finding one's own potential that stays within oneself.
With that being said, no matter how small the payment is or how insignificant the job is, students should keep themselves busy and productive as much as possible so that they don't hesitate to fight against the greater issues in their occupational lives. After all, exploring and learning are all student life is about.
