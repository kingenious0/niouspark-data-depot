 Smoking is the most prevalent issue we encounter today. There is much discussion concerning the negative effects of smoking, including whether smoking should be entirely prohibited in all restaurants across the nation. This essay argues for a widespread smoking ban in restaurants.  

For instance, smoking in public settings, especially restaurants has drawbacks including the risk of hurting others, the disruption of other patrons and the issue of non-smoking establishments. Firstly, food can become unappealing to non-smokers because of smoke. Additionally, many people will steer clear of eateries that permit smoking for this reason, which may disadvantage restaurant proprietors. Secondly, dining establishments should be welcoming to families. For instance, many families with young children frequent restaurants. There are kids there who enjoy it. However, cigarette smoke is extremely dangerous to young children if anyone is smoking there. Thirdly, customers and employees both face a health risk because of smoking . It is unfair to subject customers and restaurant staff to these risks given that smoking has been linked to major health issues like cancer among non-smokers. So, restaurants ought to be smoke-free. We might therefore draw the conclusion that smoking ought to be entirely prohibited in all restaurants across the nation.
