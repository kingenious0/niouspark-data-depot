 Smoking is a dangerous habit that has severe health risks to both smokers and non-smokers. In Bangladesh, where the majority of the population is exposed to secondhand smoke in restaurants, I agree that smoking should be completely banned in the restaurants of the country. Smoking should be banned because as it has detrimental health effects, it also poses health risk for non-smokers.

Firstly, the health risks associated with smoking are clinically proven. Smoking not only harms the individual indulging in the habit but also the people around them. Studies have found secondhand smoke to various health conditions, including respiratory diseases, heart disease, and even cancer.

Moreover, banning smoking at restaurants is will safeguard non-smokers. Peple who choose to dine out will not be in risk of diseases associated with inhaling the secondhand smokes. Besides, families with children have the right to enjoy a meal without being exposed of little ones to such harmful environments. By banning smoking in restaurants, a safe, healthy and enjoyable atmosphere can be created for all.
To sum up, we can say that to ensure the good health of both smokers and non-smokers, ban on smoking in all restaurants is essential in Bangladesh. By stopping smoking from such establishments, government can protect the health of the population. It is high time for Bangladesh to take wise step towards making a smoke-free future by banning smoking at all restaurants.
