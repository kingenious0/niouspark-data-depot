 In modern times, the issue of smoking has become highly controversial. There are some people who say that smoking must be banned in restaurants, however others believe that it's a wrong idea. I strongly agree with the former view and my opinion will be discussed in further paragraphs with a suitable conclusion.
Generally speaking, there are a number of reasons why I believe that smoking should be canceled not only in restaurants but also in all kinds of public places because it harms our health. The people who smoke cigarettes harm themselves as well as the people in their society. Smoking can cause various diseases in our body which are very harmful for us. To cite an example< it causes diabetes, Lung cancer, asthma, stroke etc. Furthermore, the smoke form cigarette smells terrible. That's why the government should forbid smoking in restaurants and all public places.
Despite these arguments, many people feel that smoking should not be banned in restaurants for a number of reasons. The main reason is that there are many smokers in our country and restaurant owners should make a place for them so that they can smoke, Overall, I don't think it's a good idea because we should not encourage people to smoke. If we allow people to smoke, the number of smokers will continue to increase, and we will get nothing but lose a lot.
In conclusion, it must be said that smoking is extremely harmful for us. That said I feel that smoking. should be banned in restaurants including various public places.
