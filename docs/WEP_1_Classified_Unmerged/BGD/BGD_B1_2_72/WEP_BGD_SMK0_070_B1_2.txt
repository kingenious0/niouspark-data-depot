 Smoking is one of the most worst habit of human being. It is also popularly known as cigarette to mass people. It is made of tobacco plant. Smokers smoke kind of all the time. That is at work,free time and even they are tensed about something. Smoking causes different types of diseases like cancer, bronchitis and other lung diseases. We cannot totally ban cigarette as much revenue of our country comes from this. 

I feel that smoking should be banned at resturants because it is a place where people eats. Restaurant is a family place where people of all kind comes with their family members and enjoys a good time there. Now a days we can see smoking zones at restaurant which is good as people who doesn't smoke can ignore that part. But the main problem arises when we see people under eighteen goes to the smoking zone.

We should keep restaurant clean and not use it like a pub. Yes many elderly people does smoke and they can use smoking zones for that but we should be careful about the young generation misusing it. Strict rules should be set for smoking at restaurant as it is a public place otherwise it is fine.

Besides government should take initiative about the uses of tobacco around the country. A fine example is our neighboring country Bhutan which is the first smoking free country. We should always remember smoking will cause bad effect on our health in the long run.
