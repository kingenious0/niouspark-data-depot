 Smoking is one of the most widespread causes of death in the modern world. When smoking is permitted in public settings, particularly restaurants, everyone is at risk of being exposed to secondhand tobacco smoking. From my point of view, smoking should be entirely banned at all the restaurants throughout the country.

To begin with, the scent of smoking might suppress one's appetite and turn them off their food. People visit restaurants to eat good food, not to be thrown off by polluted selling smoke. It also makes restaurants unsuitable for family outings. For instance, lots of families with young kids visit restaurants. Nobody wants to see little kids inhaling smoke or playing with cigarette butts. Furthermore, smoking should not be permitted in eateries due to the dangers of secondhand or passive smoking. Asthma attacks and possibly cancer can result from passive smoking, caused by inhaling tobacco that comes from smokers.

Bangladesh legislation prohibits smoking in restaurants with four walls and allows restaurant owners to build smoking zones in open areas. It's undeniable that many restaurants have a significant number of regular consumers who smoke. While many restaurants may suffer without such consumers, businesses can still turn a profit by targeting to non- smokers.

In conclusion, smoking in restaurants must be banned so that all diners get to enjoy a smoke-free meal, which is the only healthy thing to do.
