 Yes, I agree, Smoking is a bad habit that has an impact on the smoker as well as others around them. Smoking has been linked to a number of detrimental health impacts, including a higher chance of lung cancer, heart disease, stroke, and respiratory disorders. Despite this, a lot of people still smoke, frequently in public settings like restaurants.

I believe that smoking should be entirely prohibited in all dining establishments across the nation. Both smokers and non-smokers would benefit from a safer atmosphere as a result of this. Smokers would be urged to give up or find other locations to smoke, while non-smokers would no longer have to worry about the health consequences of secondhand smoke.

This restriction has previously been enacted in a number of nations, including Ireland, Norway, and New Zealand. Positive changes in the air quality and smoking rates have been observed in these nations.

Additionally, prohibiting smoking in public places like restaurants can help lessen the social acceptance of smoking. We can help prevent young people from adopting this deadly habit by reducing the visibility of smoking in public areas. Young people are particularly susceptible to peer pressure and societal norms. Smokers who assert that they have the freedom to smoke wherever they like may, of course, object. This argument, however, ignores the reality that smoking creates adverse externalities that harm those nearby. Smoking is prohibited in restaurants only to safeguard patrons' health and safety. 

In conclusion, I think that all restaurants across the nation should be entirely smoke-free. This will not only make everyone's environment safer, but it will also urge smokers to give up and lessen the social acceptance of smoking.
