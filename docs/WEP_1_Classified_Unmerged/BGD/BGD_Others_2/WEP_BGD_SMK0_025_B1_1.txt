 
         Smoking is a way of inhaling and exhaling smoke from burning plant material. This contain tobacco which is burning through cigarette, pipe etc.  
          I strongly agree with this statement because smoking is not good for health at all. It causes many diseases like heart diseases, lung problem, kidney failure, heart attack, diabetes, cancer etc. Even though people knows it's effect but still they inhale it into their body because of anxiety, depression or bad days they have been face through all day. All the individuals go to restaurants to eat food and they pay their bill for food, not for inhaling smoke. Non-smokers are badly effect if they are around the person who are smoking, surprisingly, they are effected a lot than the smoking person. Who have asthma problem are affected by it a lot. Moreover, in some recent restaurants, there are separate smoking zone where people smoke but it still dangerous because there are lots of children who come in a restaurant to eat. Another reason of banning permanently is tobacco contains nicotine which helps to increase the rate of heartbeat, breath. In this way, it will be big problem and restaurant lost their lots of valuable customers. That's why restaurant should completely banned smoking.
            In public areas like restaurants, smoking should be prohibit permanently by the law so that no one can die or have health issues because of smoking.
