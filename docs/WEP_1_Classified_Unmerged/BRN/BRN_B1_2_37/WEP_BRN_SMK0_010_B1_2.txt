It is very important that smoking any kind of cigarette and its kind be banned completely in public places especially in closed and crowded settings. It is well known that smoking brings way more harm than good to active smokers as smoking can contribute to numerous lung-related issues, such as compromised breathing, bad breaths, and lung cancer. In public places, such as in restaurants, having just one active smoker within the vicinity can make everyone else passive smokers. The smoke of the burning cigarettes can also pollute the surrounding air, causing inconvenience to other people and not to mention contaminating the food and drinks being served in the restaurants. It is essential that restaurants to not just follow the standard operating procedures in preparing food and drinks, but also to implement strict guidelines when it comes to the environment in which their products are served so as to maintain the quality of the products being sold and the health of the customers. Furthermore, the customers are of different age, which include children and the elderly. These people are at an even higher risk of developing lung-related issues caused by smoking compared to the general population. Thus, banning smoking is both an act of protecting health and also respecting others, particularly the young and old generations.
