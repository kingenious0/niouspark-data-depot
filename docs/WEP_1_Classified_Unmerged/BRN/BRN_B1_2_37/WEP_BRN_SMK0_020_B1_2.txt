I am of two minds about the statement. On one hand, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants because of the health risks and concerns caused by inhaling cigarette smoke. The smoke is harmful to everyone regardless of their age and gender, but especially to the elderly, pregnant women, children, babies, and people who have asthma. A lit cigarette is also dangerous and can cause an accidental fire inside the restaurants, for example, if the tablecloth or napkins catch fire. The smoke of the cigarette is also unpleasant to those who do not like it. So while dining in a restaurant, inhaling the smell of the smoke may make others uncomfortable and that would ruin the dining experience. On the other hand, I disagree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants because if the restaurant provides a designated area for smoking, that should not be a problem. The smokers and non-smokers can be separated while dining in the same restaurant. The smoking area should be hygienic and provided with ashtrays but without combustible materials present. That means no tablecloth, napkins, tissues, carpets, paper menu, and so on. The restaurant staff that can serve food in the smoking area should be those who are comfortable with cigarette smoke. Moreover, restaurants that cater to smokers and non-smokers would attract more customers.
