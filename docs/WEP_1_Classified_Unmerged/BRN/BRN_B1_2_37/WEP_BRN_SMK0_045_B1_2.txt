I totally agree with the banning of smoking not just in restaurants, but also in all public spaces, for example at bus stops, outside of public buildings, while driving the car, and at recreational parks. In my opinion, smokers who smoke publicly are the carriers of heart and lung diseases of people because they don’t care about the health risks imposed by second-hand smoking on others. They also don’t care about the pollution caused by the smoke and littering of the cigarette butts in the river, sewers, and on the ground. Despite the general knowledge that smoking is harmful to one’s health, selfish smokers don’t care if they are also harming the health of others. The smoke gets mixed with clean air, the air becomes contaminated and non-smokers bear the consequence of second-hand smoking. Not only that it’s a selfish behaviour, but it’s also unfair to non-smokers. The idea of smoking in restaurants is beyond comprehension. Eating meals at restaurants with your company, such as your friends and family and even alone, should be a pleasant experience. The air should be clean, the room should smell of delicious warm food and drinks, the tables should be clean, and the customers should be smiling and laughing while enjoying the meals. Smoking in restaurants destroys this pleasant experience because the air is now filled with smoke, the room smells of cigarettes, the food and drinks now smell of cigarettes, the tables now have cigarette ashes, and the non-smokers are coughing and irritated by the presence of the smoke. In my opinion, if smokers want to smoke, they should do that in a space with no one else around them. They should also be responsible to throw the butts properly. This way, they respect non-smokers and the environment.
