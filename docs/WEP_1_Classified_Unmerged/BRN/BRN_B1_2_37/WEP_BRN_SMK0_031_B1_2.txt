I have to disagree because I grew up in a family of smokers. Although I don’t smoke, my dad and grandfather always smoke after lunch and dinner so I’m used to being around smokers since I was young. I can say that I’m a passive smoker since I was young and I’m not bothered by people smoking. I understand the country’s law to ban smoking in public places is to reduce the bad impact of smoking but people like my dad and grandfather still smoke at home and when driving in cars. They never complained about the banning of smoking though. I guess they agree to do it responsibly so they don’t get fined. In other countries that are okay with smoking at restaurants, the smokers are smoking outside of the restaurants. That way the people are separated into two areas. For people like me who don’t mind the smoke, they would sit wherever. For pregnant women and people with asthma, they should sit indoors. I guess it all depends on the people themselves. The cigarette makers won’t stop producing cigarettes but if no people buy them, so they will have to close down their business. If restaurants allow smoking, that can be profitable for them.
