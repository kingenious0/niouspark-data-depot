In my opinion, I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are many reasons for this. For those who are financially inadequate, having a part-time job could alleviate their financial burden which is especially important for students overseas as there is quite a distance from their living area to university. We need to take into account their rent, spendings on food and essential items and especially transportation fare and fuel. In the case of Brunei, it is mostly on fuel costs and miscellaneous spending. Another important reason is to expose them to the real world. In my personal experience, I have those who have not worked part-time are mostly naive and spoiled, which could affect their mental health on their first job. The real world is not all sunshine and rainbows where everything is handed nicely to you, we will encounter a toxic environment, harsh and strict working conditions and even unfair ones, lazy colleagues, mean bosses, etc. This is important to shape and prepare them for future jobs as enduring and becoming resilient is very important. Another reason why it is important is that it can teach college students about time management, juggling between job and school is quite hectic if unprepared and the discipline needed, if they go through it till the end.
