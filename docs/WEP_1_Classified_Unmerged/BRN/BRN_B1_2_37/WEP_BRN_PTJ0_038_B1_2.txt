I must say that I agree with the statement. College students need to have a part-time job despite for the reason to earn extra money, but also to acquire soft and hard skills. Such as they will be able to manage their own time between studying and working, and they will also be able to discipline themselves. Furthermore, by having a part time job will assist them in the future employment as they already have the working experiences. Also, working a part-time job while in college can really help students expand their networks by connecting them with industry pros and potential future employers. It also helps students learn to handle multiple responsibilities which builds up their sense of independence and time management. Besides improving time management and discipline, working part-time also teaches students the value of money and budgeting which can give them a head start on saving money for future. On top of that, the skills learned from these jobs - like communication, teamwork, problem-solving, and customer service - are super useful no matter what career path students choose. These experiences make students more competitive in the job market and also give them practical extra skills and knowledge that complement what they've learned in college. Basically, a part-time job acts as a crucial link or bridge between college life and the professional world.
