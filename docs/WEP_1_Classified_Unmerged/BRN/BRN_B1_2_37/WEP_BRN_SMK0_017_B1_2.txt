It should be banned totally in the restaurants and it doesn't matter where in Brunei. Brunei had already implemented this rule not to allow the public to smoke in restaurants and open air. These really help the country as this is one of the ways to improve the country’s economy and the health of the people in Brunei. Because of this Bruneians have somehow dropped in the number of population who are smoking. Having smokers to sit around after eating with non-smokers also had caused bad impact on the non-smokers especially for newborns and near sick people who had asthma and heart problems and also near pregnant women. So it is really a good decision to ban people from smoking in the restaurants. We are not only helping our children and family but indirectly we are also helping our future generations and the country. By not smoking, we will not have littering of cigarettes on the ground and fire accidents such as house and forest fires. Smokers do not realise if the cigarettes that they throw away are still burning. The government had spent countless money to pay for sick people having because of cigarettes. Bruneians are just so lucky that medicine and consultation is free.
