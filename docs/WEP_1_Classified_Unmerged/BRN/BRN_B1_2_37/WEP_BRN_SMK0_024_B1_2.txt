I agree that smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants. The Brunei government has banned smoking in all public places so I can only find people smoking in the comfort of their homes. I never smoked in my life but I used to think that people look cool when they smoke. Now that I’m older and wiser, I’m glad that I never smoked. Restaurants are public places where people come for the dining experience with their family and friends. For the comfort of everyone in the restaurant, smoking should not be done inside the restaurant. Not only that the cigarette smoke is harmful to health, it also contributes to safety concerns of the restaurant’s staff and customers. Smoking not only harms the smokers but also the people around them who breathe in the smoke. Some people can tolerate inhaling cigarette smoke, some cannot. It can be bothersome to some. It is also not fair for second-hand smokers to have serious health problems like lung cancer because they do not consent to breathing in the smoke. It can only be fair if only the smokers have lung cancer. Although I have seen restaurants such as in France where there are outdoor open smoking areas, the smoke can travel inside the restaurant. Pedestrians who pass by can still inhale the smoke. I know that I must consider the rights of smokers to smoke, but smoking can be done privately and responsibly.
