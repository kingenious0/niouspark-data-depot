Smoking should definitely be banned in all restaurants. This could be a very biased opinion since I do not smoke, but when I go to a restaurant, I come to enjoy the food, not to smoke or to inhale smoke. Personally, I would find it rude to smoke in a restaurant especially if it is indoor settings, because second-hand smoke is not only detrimental to my health, but also towards those who are working in the restaurant. Because smoking can cause a lot of health issues like lung cancer and heart disease. Second-hand smoke can cause respiratory issues like asthma, for instance, and harmful for vulnerable people like pregnant women and the elderly that are eating in a restaurant. I would generally want to a restaurant and to enjoy my meal without the nuisance of inhaling second-hand smoke. Not only its uncomfortable but it can sour the experience for everyone that does not smoke. This might negatively affect the ratings or reviews of a restaurant that doesn't ban smoking, which might cause a lot of non-smokers to avoid visiting a restaurant that does not enforce smoking bans. Plus, I think that smoking bans would encourage people to stop smoking, which is good in terms of public health in the long run in Brunei. If people still want to smoke after their meal, there should at least be a designated smoking area that would cater to customers that smoke. Since I believe that everyone deserves to have clean air while enjoying his or her meals.
