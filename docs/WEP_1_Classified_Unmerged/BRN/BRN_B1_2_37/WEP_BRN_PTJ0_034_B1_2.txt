I agree that it’s important for college students to have a part-time job because it offers work experience, money, time management, and various skills. The work experience will benefit the students when they apply for jobs after they graduate college. Having the experience can boost the students CV and employers usually are interested at employing graduates who have work experience. The money earned from the part-time jobs can help the students with paying for their car fuel or repair, food, college accommodation, and other college necessities like purchasing a laptop and stationery. With the money, the students don’t need to depend on their parents. Having a part-time job and being a student can make the student manage his or her time better and increase their focus. Managing the time also include the time spared for self-care, family time, and hanging out with friends. The skills that can be obtained from having a part-time job can be communication, adaptability, and other tactile skills like organizing objects, counting money, making art coffee, or cooking. Although there are many benefits of having a part-time job while being a college student, there are downsides as well. In my opinion, the downsides are mainly from the well-being of the students. If the students can’t balance or manage the academic tasks and job tasks, it can make the students feel overwhelmed and stressed because of having multiple things to do everyday. They can lose their friends if they begin to spend less time with friends or family and focus on studying and working only. Having a part-time while being a student requires physical and mental capabilities.
