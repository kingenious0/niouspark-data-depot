I think the answer to this question depends fully on each student's situation. As a college student myself, I don't see the importance or have the urgency of getting a part-time job. This is due to two main factors. One of them being my parents, the other reason being financial security. The concept of doing part-time jobs is not foreign to me, since several of my family members and friends have them. Even I have considered getting one myself, mostly out of concern for my family and the desperation to feel independent. However, for some reason my parents have never allowed me to work until I finish studying. I assume this is because they worry for me and my well-being, they have expressed before that they dislike the idea of me participating in something that does not contribute to what I do in the future. They also repeatedly highlighted the fact that they have the finances to support me and my educational journey. With that said, I would like to acknowledge the privilege I have and I'm aware that not everyone is lucky enough to not have part-time jobs. I understand that most people take up part-time jobs due to financial reasons. Some of them have no choice but to have a part-time job to either help their family's financial issues or afford buying items they need. However, I actually think this experience helps them build their social and interpersonal skills, as well as get them familiar with earning money and what to do with it. The final answer fully depends on the student itself. If it was me, I personally don't have the need to get one even though I want to. But for other people, having a part-time job may be extremely important due to personal reasons.
