I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country because it is really bad for health and pollutes the environment. In fact smoking should be completely banned at any public places. If people want to smoke at their own private homes, that should be fine. Restaurants are usually a place where people come to eat and dine with their family and friends so if people smoke inside the restaurant, it will create an uncomfortable environment for the others who don’t smoke. Some people may not mind the smell of tobacco but some others may feel irritated by it. Personally I don’t mind the scent of tobacco but smoking should be done outside in the open air and space. I think it is fine for restaurants that allow smoking outside to provide ashtrays for the cigarette butts. It is annoying to find people littering the butts on the ground. Some people don’t realise that the cigarette that they have smoked are still lit when they throw it on the ground. This can cause unintentional fire to spread. Tobacco industry will never stop producing cigarettes but all public places such as restaurants have the right to ban smoking whether indoors or outdoors for the safety of everyone.
