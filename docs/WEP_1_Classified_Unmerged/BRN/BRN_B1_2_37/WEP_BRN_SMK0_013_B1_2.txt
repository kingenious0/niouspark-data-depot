I completely agree with this, except that it should be banned not only at restaurants but any public spaces in general. I personally think that people who smoke openly are selfish people who do not care for others and they deserve punishments. Smoking in itself is already harmful for the smokers’ health but spreading that harm for innocent people who do not even smoke is very irresponsible. If one is so desperate to smoke then perhaps find an enclosed space or smoke only at their personal areas (i.e. their homes). Moreover, not only is smoking bad for the health, but in Brunei, I am pretty sure that it had been made illegal to even bring in cigarettes. But of course, the people here have found ways to bring them in secretly anyway. Breaking that rule is one thing but smoking them in public just makes it worse. Focusing the no-smoking-rule in restaurants, I do not think that such rule should even be overtly announced in restaurants to begin with because restaurants are places where people eat, and having the smokes from cigarettes would ruin the customers’ experience, surely. Although, these shameless smokers might not realise the unpleasantness that they bring to non-smokers. Other than the smell from the smokes, some even litter their cigarettes buds everywhere in public! This is a problem because not only does this disrupt public cleanliness, the toxins from these cigarettes buds are also bad for the environment. I personally do not see any advantages for smoking cigarettes so I do not think that it should be banned only at restaurants and frankly, I think it would do us all a favour if it ceased to exist altogether.
