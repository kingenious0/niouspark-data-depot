I agree that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country because there are no good benefits that come from smoking cigarettes. When a person is smoking, the non-smoking person next to them also inhales the bad ingredients released from the cigarette. If the non-smoking person has breathing problems such as asthma, he or she will experience breathing difficulty because of the smoke. People usually just want to eat, talk, and drink when they sit in a restaurant. If people smoke inside the restaurant, the smoke can be unpleasant to others. In cafes, usually there is a warm smell of coffee but if people smoke inside a café, the smoke ruins the smell of coffee and that is very unpleasant to the others who want to enjoy the café environment. So smoking can also ruin the restaurant experience. In my opinion, people who want to smoke should go outside the restaurant or café and smoke outside. If they only smoke when they are in their own homes or inside their cars, that is even better because that is their own business and health concern. At least the smoke can’t be inhaled by others who do not want to get the dangerous risks of inhaling cigarette smoke. Many countries have no-smoking law in public places which include restaurants as well.
