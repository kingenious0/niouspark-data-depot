I agree that it’s important for college students to have part-time jobs, but juggling both work and study can be very challenging for one person. I acknowledge that part-time jobs can provide students with financial support and work experience for their future career prospects. Having a part-time job can help students earn extra money if they don’t receive an allowance from their parents or their college. The money can fund essential expenses such as food, accommodation, car fuel and maintenance, and academic resources. If the students receive regular allowances from their parents or college, they can save the earned money for their future needs. In a way, having part-time jobs can teach financial management and responsibilities. However, there are downsides of having part-time job while still being a student. Some students may struggle with managing their time for both academic responsibilities, such as finishing their assignments and studying for exams, and a part-time job. With limited free time due to juggling both work and studying, the students may feel left out by their friends and experience hardships because of stress. The stress can affect the work and academic performances of the students. So students should be aware of the well-being of their physical and mental health before deciding to take part-time jobs while they are still studying at college.
