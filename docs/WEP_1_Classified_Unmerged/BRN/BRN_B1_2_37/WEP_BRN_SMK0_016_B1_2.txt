I'm afraid I have to disagree smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. Firstly, smoking should not be treated like a crime or discriminated against. I believe that it is people's choice to smoke. However, with everything, comes a risk. However, to combat smoking in restaurants, restaurants should allocate an area where people can smoke. This may be more effective in preventing children from inhaling cigarette smoke which we know how harmful it is to inhale second-hand smoke. In my opinion, all restaurants should have an open area designated for smokers. They should have both an indoor and outdoor seating area. The outdoor area can be used by smokers while being served food but realistically, smokers usually start smoking after they are done with their meal and start socialising with their fellow smokers. Another reason is that banning smoking in restaurants may affect businesses. The traffic may become slower. Smokers would have to smoke out of sight to prevent people from seeing them or being fined. Consequently, banning smoking will drive away customers and they will not have a strong desire to dine in for a long time. They would feel the need to hastily go and seek for a place to smoke.
