I disagree because college students should focus on their study than having a part-time job. If they work part-time the students may score poorly on their assignments and cannot graduate because they don’t have more time to study. For example, there are many modules for undergraduate students in a semester so it will be hard to balance studying and working. Lectures usually occur in the morning and tutorials in the afternoon. Many students spend their time studying in the library or coffee shops to finish their assignments. If the students have part-time jobs the students will also not have time to hang out with friends, rest, or do their revision after lectures or tutorials. Of course earning money is important but it is more important to finish studying when at college and gain academic knowledge. If the students must worry about their assignments due to having deadlines, their performance at the part-time job would also be affected. The manager at the job would probably ask the student to leave the job because of their poor performance at work. Full-time students usually receive allowances during their study so that can help the students with paying for their travel money back and forth from their homes to college or paying their dorm fee. So college students must be able to save their money during their study and not spend on unnecessary things.
