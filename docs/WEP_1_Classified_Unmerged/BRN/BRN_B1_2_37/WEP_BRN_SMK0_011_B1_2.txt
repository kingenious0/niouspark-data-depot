First of all, cigarette is made from substances including tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide. Smoking can make the smoker become addicted of the cigarette. Other than that, it can affect others that smell the smoke called passive smoker. Smoking is very bad for a person’s health. In Islamic context, smoking is forbidden in Islam. It is ‘haram’ as far as the statement from the State Mufti’s Office. So, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. Although, some scholars say it is ‘makruh’, but it is important to focus for our health being. So, as far as I know, in Brunei there is law about forbidding of smoking in public places. So, it includes restaurants. In fact, some country not banning people to smoke in public but In Brunei specifically, it should be banned. In my opinion, it is a good way to reduce smoking in a country that can make people live peacefully. It is very bad decision if a country decide to not ban smoking activities in public places. I remember reading that tobacco kills more than 8 million people each year and that includes around 1 million non-smokers who are exposed to second-hand smoke. I also found that the majority of the world's smokers are actually living in low and middle-income countries. Finally, smoking is very bad that can make smoker can damage their lungs and affect other non-smokers. For me, I agree smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
