I agree. Having a part-time job comes with a lot of advantages for college students. First, working while studying can really help students get better at managing their time because they need to juggle college and work. Second, making some extra cash can give the students a bit more independence because they are earning their own money. That sense of independence can really make the students feel more responsible and rely on themselves. Third, having a job can be good for the students’ mental health. It keeps the students busy, gives them a sense of purpose and working with others can help the students feel less lonely. But the reality of balancing work and school is not for everyone especially if the students don’t want to step out of their comfort zone. The reality of having a job means having less free time which could cut into the study time and affect the students’ grades. With less free time, the students might end up hanging out less with family and friends, which can make them feel lonely. Doing both work and studying can make the students feel overwhelmed. Although a part-time job can teach students valuable skills and help them financially, it’s much more important for them to first figure out if they can handle it without sacrificing their grades or well-being. For some students, it might be better to focus on their academic performance and personal growth during college rather than piling on extra responsibilities that could lead to burnout.
