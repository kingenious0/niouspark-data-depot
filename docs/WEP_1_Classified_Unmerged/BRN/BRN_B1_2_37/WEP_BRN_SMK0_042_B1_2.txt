I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Brunei. It is really important to ban smoking in public places, especially in enclosed and crowded spaces. Smoking causes a lot of harm, like respiratory problems, bad breath, tartar on teeth, teeth yellowing, and a higher risk of lung cancer for active smokers. Even just one person smoking in a public space like a restaurant can expose everyone else to secondhand smoke, basically making them passive smokers. This not only ruins the air quality but also affects the food and drinks being served. This can make the whole dining experience worse and possibly harm the health of all customers. Restaurants need to follow strict guidelines to ensure that their environment is clean and safe for everyone, not just in food preparation but also in where the products are consumed. This is because it is really important for keeping the quality of the products high and the customers healthy. Since customers include people of all ages, especially kids, pregnant women and the elderly who are more at risk from secondhand smoke, the complete banning of smoking is essential. This is because it is not just about protecting public health but it is also about respecting others, especially the younger and older generations who deserve a safe and healthy environment. At the end of the day, banning smoking in public places is a necessary step to create a healthier society and make sure that everyone can enjoy public spaces without being exposed to harmful substances.
