As a smoker myself, I have to say I disagree. I enjoy the taste of cigarette ashes on my meals. It is like a little treat for me, I could take a huge puff and down it with a spoonful of soup. I think banning it would only encourage people to be more violent and angry all the time since smoking is a way to get relaxed and stress-free. My father was a smoker and so was my mother and my grandfather and his father before that. They always fought at the dinner table while I was a child and the only reason was because they were so dry for not smoking while having dinner. This was because my little sister had asthma and so everybody had to cater to her which sucked because then everyone would be in a bad mood. I have brought this on in my adult life and now am a smoker. I think it would be best to allow smoking in restaurants. I also think it actually makes the food taste better. Sooner or later, normalizing this will eventually normalize the smell and effects of smoking to the public. I also think restaurants would make more profit by allowing smoking, they could release their own cigarette merchandise and have cute little ashtrays to sell. I think it would make the business mainstream. While we are used to food-eating competitions, they could attract more customers with smoking competitions to be more inclusive to the communities of smokers. I conclude that we should be more open to smoking in restaurants and have the restaurants be hazed with thick smoke which could then cause a fire hazard but what matters is that people can happily enjoy a ciggie while also having a bite of their favorite meal.
