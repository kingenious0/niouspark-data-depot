As everyone aware that smoking is hazardous, not only to the smoker itself but also to others, which also called as a passive smoker. Hence, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country due to its causes and smoking can pollute the environment. We should ban smoking in restaurants to make the dining experience better for everyone. Non-smokers, especially kids and people with breathing problems, shouldn't have to deal with secondhand smoke while trying to enjoy a meal. Secondhand smoke can cause all sorts of health issues, from minor annoyances like coughing and eye irritation to serious conditions like heart disease and lung cancer. On top of that, having smoke-free restaurants would also make these places cleaner and more pleasant. The smell of tobacco can put off many customers and even affect the taste of the food. In contrast, a smoke-free environment would create a fresher, more enjoyable dining experience, which could attract more customers and improve the restaurant's reputation. Banning smoking in restaurants would also be a big step in reducing smoking overall. It would show how important public health is and might make smokers think twice about their habit. By doing this, the country could make big strides in protecting its citizens' health, keeping the environment clean, and promoting a healthier, livelier community.
