I agree to this statement, only due to the fact that I personally know someone that has suffered from lung cancer, even though they were not the ones who smoked. They inhaled smoke as a second-hand smoker so I do think smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country, now I understand some people cannot live without their nicotine so I believe a compromise should be done which is to allow the smokers an area where they can smoke and ensure that it's ventilated and away from the rest of the citizens. There has been much too many cases of people getting it due to second-hand smoking and I personally would like to live for a long time. And considering restaurants are public areas I can only imagine the issues if kids or babies were around that type of air. It is just not healthy. I think smokers should also think of the life if they have their loved ones with them. Some smokers have chosen to chew gums instead of smoking to gradually reduce their nicotine craving. Some smokers chose to do exercises instead so they will be distracted from thinking of smoking. When they are tired after exercising, they will shower and sleep early so they do not have the time to smoke. Some smokers simply have the determination to stop smoking once they get married or know that their wives got pregnant.
