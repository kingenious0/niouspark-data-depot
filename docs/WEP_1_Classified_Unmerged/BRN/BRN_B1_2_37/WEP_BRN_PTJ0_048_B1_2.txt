I think deciding whether or not to get a part-time job as a student really depends on each person’s situation. Although it is encouraged to experience the real world through working while studying, but there are pros and cons of it that need to be considered. I know a lot of students out there take up part-time jobs because they need extra money to pay for their college essentials, transportation, and monthly expenses, and to afford whatever they want without depending on their parents’ money. I think this part is great because it teaches the students to be more self-sufficient and independent. Even if they have parents who give them allowance or pay for whatever they need, the earned money from the part-time job can be saved for future needs, like buying their own car or paying for house rent if they want to move out of their parent’s house. Apart from managing their own money and being independent, I also think that working a part-time job teaches a lot about social interactions, time management, and handling responsibilities, which are skills that are definitely valuable in the long run. The cons of having to do both part-time jobs and attending college are the stress and having less free time. I think it’s natural to feel stressed when we have to do so much yet want to excel at everything. At the of the day, students must prioritise their studies, not their part-time jobs. With less free time, there won’t be much social interaction with friends and family which can make the students feel lonely. All that considered, it really depends on the individual.
