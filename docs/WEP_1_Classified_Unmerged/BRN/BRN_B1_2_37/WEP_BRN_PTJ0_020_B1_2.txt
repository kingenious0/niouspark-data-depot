I am of two minds about the statement because I both agree and disagree. On one hand, I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job because they can gain work experience, earn a salary, build connections for their future careers, and personal development. Nowadays, in addition to academic qualifications, work experience is also what most employers would look for during a job interview. If you only have academic qualifications, employers might think that you are lazy at finding a job or building your skills. Some college students hop from one job to another, for example, from working as a barista to a cashier to a pump attendant at a gas filling station to childcare workers, just for the search of extra money. When they earn their salary, it builds a sense of achievement, which I think that is what adulthood is about. When you earn your money after a hard work, you will care for it and spend it wisely. Building connections with employers is also important so the students can get a job straightaway after they graduated from college. In terms of personal development, having a part-time job teaches us to be independent, responsible, and how to manage time, energy, and money. On the other hand, I disagree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job because it would take away their social life and time for studying and completing their assignments. Say if your lecture classes are in the morning, then you have tutorial classes to attend from 1pm to 3pm. Your part-time job is from say 5pm to 11pm. That means you will have less time to sleep and study.
