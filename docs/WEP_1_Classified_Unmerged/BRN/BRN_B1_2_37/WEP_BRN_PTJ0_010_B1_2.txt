Having a part-time job offers several advantages to college students in a number of ways. Firstly, working while studying can help students to discipline themselves better and in managing time more effectively. Secondly, having a part-time job helps to generate income for the students. Thirdly, the students get to become more independent in life as they are earning their own money with their own struggles. Fourthly, it is beneficial in terms of their mental health by keeping themselves occupied with both study and side work so as to reduce their lonely time. Regardless, having to multitask is not meant for everyone and this also applies to having a part-time job for students. This is particularly true for those who are heavily dependent on their parents and are not willing to push themselves out of their comfort zone. Having a side job also means that the students have to hustle even more and this can take up a lot of their free time that can otherwise be used for doing additional reading, spending more time for completing assignments, and concentrating more to produce work of better quality. Additionally, social time with family and friends is reduced and that can have undesired effects on the students’ mental health.
