I completely agree with the statement because of many reasons. First, smoking cigarettes itself is bad for health and the quality of air. Smoking can cause many health problems like lung cancer and respiratory issues. Smoking cigarettes is destroying the lungs. The smoke itself is not pleasant to smell and it could linger on the clothes worn by the smoker. Smoking can also cause dental problems like having tar residue between the teeth and yellowing the teeth. The bad and dangerous ingredients from cigarette smoke are not only harmful to smokers but also to second-hand smokers. In fact, it is more dangerous to the second-hand smokers because their clean lungs are not used to the smoke. The other group of people who can be badly affected from inhaling the smoke are pregnant women, infants, and asthmatic people. Second, restaurants are places where people eat and drink and enjoy their time with their family or friends or by themselves. No sane people would want to have the taste of their food ruined by the cigarette smoke. Third, smoking in restaurants is really dangerous because it can cause fire to start. The ash from the cigarettes can also make the restaurants dusty and dirty. Lastly, the smoke can cause stress to the staff and customers who do not like it. They might leave the restaurants.
