I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are several reasons in my opinion on why it should be banned first and foremost the most important is health issues. By banning smoking in restaurants, it can hinder smokers a bit while they are not in a restaurant, but healthwise if they continue to smoke in restaurants, they can also affect other people even if they don't smoke. They are called passive smokers. There are cases where a person who doesn't smoke gets lung cancer by being around a smoker for a period of time. This can affect children as well as having breathing issues. By allowing smoking in a restaurant, it introduces a risk of fire as many items in a restaurant are flammable. The smell is another factor as the smell sticks to the fabric in my opinion and can be hard to get rid of. Based on my experience, in the restaurants I have been to which allow smoking, the walls are yellowed due to the smoke and degraded faster and is hard to breathe in. All in all, I agree that it should be banned in restaurants for the sake of the health of customers and smokers alike.
