Generally, having a part-time job would give significant benefits to college students. For instance, it provides financial aid and support for students and their college life. Since college students are more prone to socialize with friends and often hang out, therefore, having extra pocket money would be comforting. Moreover, the students can also save up for their future after graduating from college. This would enormously help since getting a permanent job is getting tougher. Likewise, having a part-time job before graduation would be also helpful as it provides a good history record for their curriculum vitae and preparation for the permanent job. However, having part-time job can arise in difficulty and requires high level of commitment. This is because college student needs to balance their time very well as some college lesson periods are on a tight schedule and require much attention to accel in the course. Furthermore, it can also decrease socializing time if the time for the meet-up does not align with other people such as friends, college, and family. Therefore, for these reasons, it is important for the college student to have a part-time job only if the students are able to find a balance in socializing, studying, and transportation.
