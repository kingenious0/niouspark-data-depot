I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job because there are many benefits that come with having a work experience while being a student. By having a part-time job, college students can earn extra money in addition to their monthly allowance. If the student doesn’t spend the money much, the money can be useful for future needs. Having a part-time job can give the student a work experience which can boost skills and connections. Most students who have graduated university look for jobs where they worked part-time, so since the students used to work there and understood the workplace, it will boost the chance of the students to get accepted there for a full-time job. Having a part-time job can teach the students how to manage their time so they can balance studying and working. Since anyone can have more than one part-time jobs, some hardworking college students even work part-time for seven days a week so they can earn more money. They even work at weekends which I think is very impressive. It is also important to have enough time to rest especially when the students have to study for an upcoming exam or to submit their assignments. I believe that if the students are committed to do well in their studies, even if they have part-time jobs, they will succeed in finishing their studies.
