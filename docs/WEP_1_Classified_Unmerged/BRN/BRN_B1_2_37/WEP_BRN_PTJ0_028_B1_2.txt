I think I can agree to a certain extent. I agree that it is good for college students to have a part-time job but I don’t agree that it is important. In my opinion, having a part-time job is great for work experience, the CV, the money, and connecting with others professionally, but it is not a must thing to do. Because students need time and energy to focus on their study. I myself as a university student find that if I work part-time, I don’t think I would able to divide my time between working and studying. I think that is because I can be absorbed into studying because I like it. If I work, that would be chaotic for me. But I can understand if other students have part-time jobs because they want to earn money because students can’t just depend on their allowances. Some students are fee-paying and some are government-funded so it is a different case for everyone. I think that if the student can find the balance between working and studying, then they should do that. If not, then I think that there is nothing wrong with focusing on doing one thing at a time because everyone is different. I myself can’t do many things at one time because I can get overwhelmed and panicked. So I prefer to finish my undergrad first, then I can look for a job.
