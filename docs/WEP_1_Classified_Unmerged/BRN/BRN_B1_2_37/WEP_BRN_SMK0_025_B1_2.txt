This honestly shouldn't even be a question. There is only one answer: yes. Not only does this apply to restaurants, but to other public and private areas as well. Elaborating on the reasons why won't take long, since there is clearly only one answer. Smoking does not only affect your health, but it affects your mental well-being and relationships as well. This is quite embarassing to admit, but if it helps me reach my point across then I don't mind sharing this personal information. I grew up with a father who smokes, so I often hear complaints about the stench and how harmful it is from my other family members. Since the idea of smoking was introduced to me at a very young age, I never really batted an eye over my father's actions. However, I've recently noticed how he started coughing more often which worries me to death. I can't help but think about how much time I have left with him every time I see him smoking. Despite our warnings, quitting smoking is much harder than it seems. It's addicting to smokers, and it takes a very long time for people to quit. Banning smoking in restaurants implies that people are allowed to smoke somewhere else, and encourages them to smoke in hiding. That way, it's harder for us to catch them in action. Instead, I suggest we ban and offer them help in the form of therapy or a substitute to help smokers get over their addiction.
