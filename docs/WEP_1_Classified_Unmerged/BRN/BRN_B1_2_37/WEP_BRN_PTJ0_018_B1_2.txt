I slightly agree to getting a part-time job during college only based from my experience. I think it is important for the lifelong skills you will gain throughout the job and above all that, you will also be getting some income which I think is a need for college students. This means no crappy food and actually eating the food that you want. In terms of skills, it depends on what kind of job you get, whether it is an office internship or simply working in a cafe. Building connections throughout could benefit you in the future and in the meantime of doing the job, you are seeking your hobbies and passions. I personally enjoyed having a job during my time in college. I did gain some sort of experience in the field and connections which then did benefit me for future jobs. The money was great too, I bought the things I wanted to and ate the things I wanted to simply because I could afford them. I also saved up some cash for emergencies. As much as I enjoyed working, there are downsides to it. The work-life has completely consumed me and I became a workaholic. I had made a part-time job a full-time job; ignoring all assignments and priorities changing. I had no time for classes and social life. Ultimately failing my classes and having friends cut me off for not making time for them. I worked too much that my body was shutting down on me and I was not taking care of myself. I had developed sleep deprivation and had issues driving back home. So I will say that having part-time jobs as a college student is very much a 50/50 for me, as much as I enjoyed it, it was also killing me.
