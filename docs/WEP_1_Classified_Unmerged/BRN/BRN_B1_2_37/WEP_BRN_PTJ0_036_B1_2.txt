I’m not sure if I 100% agree or disagree on the statement because college students having a part-time job can be a good and also a bad thing. Some people say that the good thing about working part-time can give students practical experience and valuable skills, which can be a big plus for their future careers. However, some people also say the bad thing about working too much is that it can hurt a student's ability to stay in school and do well. Juggling work and school can be super stressful and make it harder for students to finish a degree. They may end up failing their modules or extending their semesters because they can’t take a lot of modules in one semester. In my opinion, it's important for students to have the option of working part-time because of the work experience and salary, but colleges need to step up and provide support to help students handle their work and school commitments. Like at UBD, students who can’t take a lot of modules in one semester can take a minimum of two modules per semester. In my opinion, whether or not to work part-time should be a personal decision based on a student's individual circumstances, goals, and ability to find a balance between work and school.
