Having a part-time job while being college students can have its pros and cons. This means that part-time jobs can be both necessary and unnecessary depending on the living conditions of the students. Hence, this essay will briefly explain the two situations by considering the possible living situations of the students. Having a part-time job can be important for college students. In this case, their living conditions may be the catalyst to want and willingly look for part-time jobs. The students may be financially unstable or preferring financial independence from their families or simply desiring to achieve financial stability on their own too while also being given financial support from their families. All these factors may lead to the determination to look for part-time jobs, especially if they already have plans on how to use their earnings such as for buying foods, paying for school fees, paying for insurance, and more. Particularly for those who live in college dorms, they may want to earn money to pay for their rents which can be costly. In some other case, having a part-time job may not be as important for college students. There can also be various scenarios why students may not have plans to do part-time work. They may prefer to focus on their studies first or to have resting time after their studies. They may be financially stable especially if their families also give them enough financial support. This is not necessarily suggesting that they are lazy to put some efforts into the financial stability of their lives. Rather, they may have other priorities first and would like to experience things in order such as finishing all studies first. Only when they feel academically satisfied enough will they start looking for jobs.
