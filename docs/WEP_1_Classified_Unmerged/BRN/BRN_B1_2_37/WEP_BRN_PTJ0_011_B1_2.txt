Part-time job is a very good way for college students to gain side income for their life. As far as I know, I agree that college students should have a part-time job as long as the students can divide their time perfectly. It is important because, it’s a win-win situation for student to get their experience in a working environment preparing them for their future. Additionally, it serves as a lesson to them, gaining necessary skills and information. Therefore, part-time job is much suitable for college students to gain experiences and skills rather than just doing school assignments such as homeworks, presentations and others. In my opinion, Part-time job has more advantages than disadvantages. Among its disadvantage is that it can make the student’s grades affected badly as they will not be able to stay focus during their classes. Other than that, it can drain their energy as they will be focusing on two sides of work; which is studying and working. It is a long-term investment while they study so that they can manage their time, their activities, their home errands etc. Finally, for college students, it is very good decision to make money in a young age. So that they can manage early their lives well-being.
