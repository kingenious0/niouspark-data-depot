It is important that students should have part-time jobs other than studying. One of the reasons is that they will have more money to pay their daily living expenses such as buying gas for their car, paying for food and groceries (which are very expensive in this time and age due to inflation), paying their phone bills (be it postpaid or prepaid, our data is very little and expensive in Brunei), etc. Next, by having part-time jobs, they will also learn how to divide their time between working and studying. By dividing their time into two, they will learn to allocate study time, working and studying creates a nice balance. This may be practice for when college is over and working for a corporation is a routine unlike studying where classes are not 8 hours a day. Another reason why it is important is because having experience in any industry may apply when working for a corporation, for example, working with people, meetings, developing social skills with clients, networking, etc. Another example is a student were to work at a cafe and from there, they would acquire skills such as working in a fast-paced environment and learning how to deal with conflicts that may arise with customers.
