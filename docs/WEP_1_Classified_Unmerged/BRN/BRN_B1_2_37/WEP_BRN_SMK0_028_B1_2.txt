As a student of health sciences myself, I definitely agree that smoking should be banned at all restaurants. Smoking is not only harmful to our health but it is also harmful to the environment. Just with one lit cigarette, the harmful smoke can badly affect the respiratory system of the smoker and also others who inhale the smoke. Restaurant types can be open or closed spaces. If someone smokes while sitting in a restaurant, the smoke can be inhaled by others whether the restaurant is open or closed space. Most people wouldn’t enjoy eating their meals while also inhaling the cigarette smoke so that would ruin their dining experience in restaurants. Customers can also be people with asthma, pregnant women, children and those who don’t like cigarette generally. So if someone smokes at a restaurant, that is selfish and inconsiderate of others. But I’m aware of restaurants that provide a smoking space so smokers can dine there. Smokers are people too, so if restaurants provide a smoking space, that is to accommodate the smokers and non-smokers but that would mean the staff must be comfortable with that too. Some of the staff may not want to enter the smoking area, so that means there should be members of the staff who are fine with smoking. There should be extra safety precaution implemented in the smoking space so that no fire can start from the lit cigarette or the ashes, like no tablecloths or napkins on the dining tables, no carpets, and fire extinguishers must be present and ready in the room.
