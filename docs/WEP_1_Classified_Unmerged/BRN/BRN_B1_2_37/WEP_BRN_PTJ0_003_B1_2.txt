I agree with the statement. Most college students only earn a stipend during the duration of their study which they would spend on their accommodation, travel expenses, food, and study materials. The stipend is usually not much but enough to cover their needs. If the student is frugal, they will be able to save some of that money every month even after paying for their accommodation, transportation, food, and books. If the student finds it difficult to save money, they would need to work to earn extra money. A part-time job is perfect for college students to earn that extra money because they can attend their classes and come to work when their classes are finished. However, part-time jobs can either be advantageous or disadvantageous for the students. Some part-time jobs offer works that can be done from home so the students would not need to physically attend the workplace and do the job anywhere as long as they have a computer. Other part-time jobs require physical attendance and staying at the workplace hours until the end of work hours. So, it all depends on the students which type of part-time jobs they want to do. Nevertheless, the importance of having a part-time job while studying at college is that it gives a balance of a real-world work experience and teaches the values of responsibility, time-management, independence, and the joy of earning money from hard work.
