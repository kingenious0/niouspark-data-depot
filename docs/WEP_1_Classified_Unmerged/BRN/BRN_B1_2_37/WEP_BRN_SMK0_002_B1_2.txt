Yes. Smoking should be banned completely at all restaurants in the country because smoking is very harmful and bad for our health, especially when being exposed to children, pregnant women and those who have become a passive smoker inside the restaurants. Banning smoking at all restaurants is a good practice that can help people to live longer, improve their health and have a healthy lifestyle. Smoking is not only bad at the restaurants, but also unhygienic as the smoke produces ashes.  Although the restaurant provides an ashtray, the ashes that are being placed inside the tray can travel easily when exposed to the wind. Those ashes can spread and destroy the quality of the food without us knowing. All restaurants should not provide two different types of areas; the smoking room and non-smoking room, because it will encourage people to smoke anywhere at any time. Smoking produces smoke that leaves smells on the rooms, furniture and clothes. This might affect the room air quality of the restaurants as well. Personally, I dislike the smell of cigarettes. I come to enjoy my time appreciating the foods that I have ordered at the restaurant but I get disappointed because my clothes and stuff all smell like cigarettes.
