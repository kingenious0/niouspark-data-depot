I am quite in the middle for this question, to some extent yes but sometimes no. I believe that if the person is able to manage their time well then they should try and get a part-time job however if you are the opposite then it would not do well for you. Because having a part time job requires a big level of commitment along with a lot of planning on your side as the employer, so that you can ensure you have enough time to study but also work. All the while making sure you are physically, emotionally and mentally sound. The planning includes managing your time between working and studying. Since you are still studying, you are going to attend lectures and tutorials, work on your assignments and sit for an exam at the end of the semester. If you are working part time then you are going work maybe six hours a day. However there are caveats such as if you are someone who is really in need of money then yes by all means take a part-time job, if you want to have the part-time job to have a little bit of freedom then please go right ahead. I think at the end of the day people should decide for their own whether having a part time job is worth their time.
