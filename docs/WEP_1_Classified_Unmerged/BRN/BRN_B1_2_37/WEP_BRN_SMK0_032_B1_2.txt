I totally think smoking should be banned in all restaurants. It's just not cool for public health, non-smokers, and the overall dining vibe. First off, smoking is really bad for everyone's health, not just the smokers but also for those who breathe in the secondhand smoke. Secondhand smoke has all kinds of dangerous chemicals and can cause breathing problems, heart disease, and even cancer in non-smokers. Banning smoking in restaurants would keep customers and staff safe from these health risks and make it a better, healthier environment for everyone. Plus, lots of people hate the smell of smoke, and it can totally ruin the dining experience. Restaurants want to create a chill and enjoyable atmosphere for their customers, and having smoke around can really mess that up. Having a smoke-free environment means that everyone can enjoy their meals without dealing with the unpleasant smell or health concerns from secondhand smoke. Also, banning smoking in restaurants fits with the bigger effort to get people to smoke less and live healthier lives. Many countries that have put similar bans in public places have seen good results, like fewer people smoking and better public health. These measures also encourage smokers to cut back or even quit so that’s making life better for everyone. Some might say that smoking bans take away personal freedom, but I think it's important to think about the rights of individuals and the safety of the public. Having a smoke-free environment in restaurants is way better than the downsides, giving everyone a healthier and more enjoyable dining experience.
