I agree with the banning of smoking at restaurants. The danger of cigarette smoke affects whoever breathes in the smoke, that means the smokers themselves and those who indirectly inhale the smoke in the air. Smoking, both directly and indirectly, can cause the lungs to deteriorate and the worst outcome is lung cancer. For people with asthma, the smoke can cause uncontrollable coughing and breathing problem. By banning smoking in restaurants, it can help increase public health awareness and cleaner air. Since restaurants are places to dine in and enjoy our meals and where the staff work and cook, the air inside should be clean from any pollutants. By banning smoking, restaurants don’t need to prepare ashtrays or worry about the fire hazards of cigarettes. Restaurants can prepare napkins and tablecloths for the dining table, and carpeting for the floors. Without the cigarette ends and ashes, cleaning up the restaurants is also easier for the staff. Without the smoke travelling around inside or outside the restaurants, the dining scene is comfortable and pleasant to the eyes and attract people to have meals there. Although the banning of smoking at restaurants can still make people smoke anywhere else, smoking should be done with responsibility and consideration of other people.
