Yes, I agree because many students require additional financial support to cover essential expenses like food, transportation, and fuel to continue their education. Even though schools may provide allowances, these funds may not always be sufficient for students who need to save for the future or prepare for emergencies. Some students are fortunate enough to receive extra money from their parents. But other students often still struggle to save due to various expenses. For instance, students who own vehicles must have their own savings for car maintenance, repairs, and daily use, which adds to their financial burden. Moreover, it's crucial for students to learn how to earn money while they are still young. This is because, after graduation, they may face challenges in securing permanent employment and those who haven't developed financial independence might find this transition difficult. In situations where graduates struggle to find a job, starting their own business from scratch could be their only option. They can use their talents in cooking or making drinks to build businesses in food and beverages. Despite the challenges of entrepreneurship, it is essential to be persistent and resilient for sustaining their livelihood.  We need to accept the fact that some people find jobs more easily than others, while some face repeated rejections despite their efforts. This is why having a part-time job during college is so important. Part-time work not only helps students meet their immediate financial needs but also teaches them valuable lessons about earning money and coping with the realities of life after graduation.
