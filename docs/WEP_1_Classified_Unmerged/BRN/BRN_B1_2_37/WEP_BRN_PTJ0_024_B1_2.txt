Based on my experience working as a barista at a café, I agree that having a part-time job is important for college students. Before I was offered the job, I relied on my college allowance which was just enough for me to spend on travelling by car. I was lucky that my parents had a spare car which I could drive. But students don’t always receive the allowance on time. I experienced three months without allowance so my parents had to give me money for travelling and food. Now I work at a café so I have my own money and I no longer ask my parents for money. I have always loved the smell of coffee and wanted to master coffee-making so I enjoy working as a barista. The downside of working part-time while being a student is I always look at the time. I have to manage my time between going to college and coming in for work. My employer is kind to me because he understands that I still study at college. At first, I find it difficult to balance studying and working but after a while, I realize that I get better at managing my time. I learned that it is important for me to just focus on attending lectures and doing my assignments when I am at college and not to participate in extracurricular activities. If I join such activities, I won’t have the time to spend on my assignments. Another good thing about working part-time is the free food and drinks I can bring home at the end of the day. Sometimes I can bring home coffee and baked food. My coworkers are also nice to me so I find my work environment comfortable and not demanding.
