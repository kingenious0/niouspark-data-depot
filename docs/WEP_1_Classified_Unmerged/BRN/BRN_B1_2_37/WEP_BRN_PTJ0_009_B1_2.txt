I disagree with that idea if the students are under the Brunei government scholarship. The main reason is because the government has paid any cost incurred during their study. The scholarship also includes several allowances for the students. The government is awarding the scholarship to allow students to completely focus on their study, personal development, and maximise any opportunities provided by the university during their course of study. If the students were to have a part-time job, it would defeat the purpose of the scholarship. Significant amount of time would be taken by the job. Those time could have been used to join UBD clubs, participate in extra projects, and revision. In which, all those things could equip the students with valuable experience and knowledge that they likely would not be able to get from other places, except in universities. However, the decision is up to the individual themselves and to Brunei government. This is just my opinion. I am only talking from my experience that is different from everybody else. The Brunei government might actually be okay with the students doing a part-time job during their study. Regardless of whether they are doing a part-time job or not, both experiences are valuable and unlikely to be a waste. Having a part-time job could be difficult to maintain with studying. The skill to manage time could be a good lesson for the students.
