I would say I agree but also disagree on the banning of smoking. Smoking is really bad for our health, especially the secondhand smoke from tobacco cigars. It can mess up the lungs if we are around it a lot. E-cigarettes, or vaping, might not be as bad for people around the smoker but they can still be addictive. Smokers often feel the need to smoke at unexpected times, like when they're dining out. But they need to be considerate and not expose others to the smoke. Good ventilation is key to keeping the air clean and making sure everyone can enjoy their time at the restaurant. If restaurants have designated smoking areas and good ventilation, then maybe a complete ban on smoking is not necessary. However, even with designated smoking areas, there are still concerns about the effectiveness of separating smokers from non-smokers because smoke can easily travel through open spaces. This means that non-smokers could still be exposed to harmful substances. The presence of smoking areas might also encourage smoking especially among young people who are still forming their habits and beliefs about tobacco use. Experts on public health often advocate for stricter regulations and they always argue that a complete ban on smoking in public places is the most effective way to protect everyone's health and reduce smoking rates overall. But the source of the problem is the industrial production of tobacco. Smokers might find ways to get their hands on the cigarettes.
