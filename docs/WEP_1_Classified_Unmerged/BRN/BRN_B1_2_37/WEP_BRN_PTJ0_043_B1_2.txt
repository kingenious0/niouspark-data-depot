I think it’s important for students to have part-time jobs alongside their studies for several reasons. First, students can have more money for paying fuel for their cars, car maintenance, covering the expenses of food and accommodation (if they live away from their parents), and paying their phone bills. The money can be saved up for emergency situations as well. By earning their own money, students can achieve a sense of financial independence and responsibility which is a crucial part of growing up and real-world. Secondly, dividing their time for both work and studies teaches students the valuable skill of time management. They can learn to divide their time for work while also making sure that their academic priorities are not neglected. The time management skill is a valuable practice for the students’ future professional lives, especially when they are transitioning into a full-time work environment. Thirdly, the experience gained from part-time jobs is valuable because it provides students with practical skills that can be applicable across various industries. For example, working with colleagues, interacting with customers, joining company meetings, and improving networking skills are all important things that students can learn through having part-time jobs. Working in settings such as a café and restaurants can equip students with essential abilities, like adapting to a fast-paced work environment and handling customers’ demands.
