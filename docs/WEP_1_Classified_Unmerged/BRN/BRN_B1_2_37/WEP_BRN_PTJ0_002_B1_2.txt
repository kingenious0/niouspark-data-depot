I strongly agree with the statement above that college students should have a part-time job. This is very important as this will prepare the students for their future to at least have a job once they graduated avoiding unemployment. Having a part-time job not only prepare the students for their future, but also helps the students to unlocked their time management skills. They can become more focus on what they are doing and punctual as they need to divide their time for college assignments and part-time job or even multitasking. A part-time job, likewise, can support the students financially. Some students might have financial problems and some might not, but having a part-time job really helps a lot in improving their needs. Nonetheless, not all jobs are suitable for college students as that requires more time or energy to complete the task given. In my opinion, college students should be able to find a part-time job that can be done online from home or anywhere, and did not take a lot of time to do the job such as virtual assistance so they can still prioritize their college assignments over work while earning some money. This can also help them to save more time, not to travel from one place to another.
