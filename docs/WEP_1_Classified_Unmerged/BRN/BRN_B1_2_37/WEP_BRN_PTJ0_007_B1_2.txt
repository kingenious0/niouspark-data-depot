I am neutral on above statement. There are several reasons for my argument on why I agree on the above statement. First, the worsening economy in the country. Likewise in Brunei, our economy are getting bad where prices for almost everything rises but salary or in this case, allowances stays stagnant. Most students struggles with saving money, so they tend to splurge especially on foods when their allowances is credited to their account, making them struggle financially for the remaining weeks until their next allowance. Atleast, with a part-time job, they will have extra money that they will be able to save up or use during emergency situations. Next, with a part-time job or jobs, they will be able to make a better content on their resume or curriculum vitae on their work experience as most job looks into these students previous job experiences. These part-time job will also make these students marketable and ready to work with confidence. Although, the following are some of the reasons why I disagree with the statement above. Part-time jobs usually clashes with the students' class schedule. There are often time where students skips their class just to attend their part-time job. Some of the job also tend to happen during odd hours, such as from evening to 10pm. This eventually distract the students from focusing on their study, and they may perform badly on their classes. And lastly, depending on theit part-time job, some part-time job are physically demanding, where this may affect the student's health and well-being in the long run. In conclusion, the importance of a part-time job depends on how well the students are able to handle them.
