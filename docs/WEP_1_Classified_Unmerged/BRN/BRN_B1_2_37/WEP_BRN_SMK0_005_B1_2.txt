The risk of smoking can be detrimental to the people who are exposed to the smoke produced by tobacco types of cigars as it can cause several lung problems to the person who inhales it, i.e. passive smokers. However, it may or not be affected by the type of e-cigars like vaping as they have different types of compositions. Moreover, both, tobacco and e-cigar types can be addictive and much needed for smokers to inhale it and survive. The addiction can occur at random times such as when in a restaurant. It is comforting for smokers to relieve the desire to smoke when in a restaurant. However, the smoker must be far away from other people when smoking to reduce the risk of inhaling the smoke. Moreover, proper ventilation is needed to remove the smoke from other people to inhale it. This will also be helpful if the restaurant provides a space for the smoker to smoke and makes other non-smoking people not rest assured without thinking about the consequences of the smokers. Therefore, for these reasons, completely banning smoking in a restaurant is not necessary unless the restaurant provides a space and installation of good ventilation in the restaurant for the smokers and non-smokers to feel comfortable.
