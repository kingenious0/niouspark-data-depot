I disagree. College students have their own occupation which is to attend lectures, study, finish their assignments and then graduate. When I was doing my undergraduate degree, it was a lot to do in one day because I had to attend either lectures or tutorials both in the morning and in the afternoon. Then when I came home, I had to do revision because if I didn’t, I would forget what was taught in the lessons. Then I also had to prepare some research idea or topics for assignments. I was not a super smart student but I did my best to meet all deadlines and did revisions especially for exams at the end of the semester. To me at that time it was already so much to do in one day. If I also had to work, I don’t think I would be able to do that. I probably wouldn’t be able to graduate after four years of doing an undergraduate degree. I would suggest college students to finish their studies first before taking a job so that they can focus on studying and graduating. I was fortunate to have parents who had extra cars which I could drive to and from university. Some friends were dropped off and fetched by their parents so they had to walk from one building to another. Other friends carpooled to save money or if they didn’t have extra cars to drive.
