I’m somewhat in favour of having a part-time job during college because of my own personal experience. I believe that it’s important to have a job while being a student for the valuable skills it can give. These skills can be useful in life. The skills one gains depend on the location and position of the job, such as working at restaurants or cafes, supermarkets, schools, etc. By having a job, the student can earn some income to pay for their food, accommodation, car fuel, emergencies, etc. Since nowadays students enjoy studying or working on their assignments at cafes, the earned money can buy them a cup of coffee or a meal. The money can also help the students to be more self-reliant even if they live with their parents or drive their parents’ car. At the workplace, students can build up connections so that they can target the job they want once they graduate from college. But there are also drawbacks to having a part-time job and being a student. The student’s health and well-being can be affected due to not having enough time to rest or sleep. Their daily routine can become repetitive, and exhausting, and assignments may not get done. Their academic performance may decrease, leading to failing their course. They may also lose their friends if they no longer hang out as much as before. In conclusion, if college students want to have a part-time job, I believe that having a balance between working and studying and taking care of their physical and mental health is important.
