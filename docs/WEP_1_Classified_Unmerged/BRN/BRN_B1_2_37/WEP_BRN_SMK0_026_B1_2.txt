As one of the common causes of lung problems and even death, smoking should be banned not only in restaurants but in almost all places in the country. Smoking can harm people based on two categories, the smokers and those surrounding the smokers. Focusing on restaurant situations, first, smoking may harm the smokers. In this case, their health would be the most risked from smoking. This is because the harmful substances that have affected the lungs may cause difficulty in breathing. In restaurants that serve smoked foods, the smokes may add to the breathing difficulty aside from the side effects of smoking tobacco. Not only that, but smoking may also cause other health problems such as headaches, yellow eyes, teeth and fingernails, and also nausea which may further make it difficult to consume food. In restaurants, smokers may find it difficult to eat even though they may have the appetite. This would not only trouble themselves but also the staffs who put their time into making the foods. Second, smoking may also harm the surrounding of the smokers. In restaurants, smokers may pose a potential risk in making other customers become passive smokers due to inhaling the smoke. Not only that, ashes that fall on top of the tables may also be harmful if not cleaned properly before the next customers use the tables. Not only directly on the customers, but the smoke and ashes from tobacco that go around the room may diffuse into the foods and may also indirectly lead into harmful substances being consumed by the customers. All these possible situations may also lead to lung problems for the customers, headaches, and possibly other health issues, and they are especially harmful to young children and those who are pregnant.
