I agree that smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants in the country. For now, I can only think of three reasons. The reasons are because of health, environment, and social or public comfort. First of all, smoking is really bad for health. It harms not only the smokers but also the people around them who breathe in the smoke. Not everyone can stand inhaling cigarette smoke. It can be extremely annoying to some people. For the non-smokers who inhale the smoke, it can cause serious health problems like lung cancer, heart disease, and even breathing problems such as asthma. Besides, restaurants should be places where people can eat comfortably and relax without worrying about their health. Secondly, banning smoking in restaurants can help the environment. Air pollution is already bad, especially during the extremely hot weather in Brunei. People would do open fire to dispose their wastes, which I think is really bad for the environment. So if there are cigarette butts, that will add to littering and of course air pollution as well. I think, without smoking, the inside and outside of restaurants will be cleaner. We also won't have to deal with as much trash from cigarette butts and ashes. Lastly, without smoking inside or outside restaurants is better for everyone socially. Families with babies or children and people who don't smoke can enjoy their meals without being bothered by the smoke. This makes restaurants more welcoming and comfortable for all customers, which can also help businesses attract more people.
