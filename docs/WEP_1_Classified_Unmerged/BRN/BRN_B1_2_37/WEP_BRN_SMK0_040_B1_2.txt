I would disagree because many restaurants offer both outdoor and indoor dining spaces which allow a variety of experiences. Some people, especially those visiting cafés or restaurants after work or on weekends, enjoy relaxing with a cigarette while hanging out with friends. For them, smoking is a must-have part of their dining experience, particularly after a meal when they consider it the perfect time to smoke. If all restaurants in the country were to ban smoking, these customers might choose to stop visiting altogether and they might search for other restaurants where they can smoke freely. This could lead to a decline in business for restaurants that ban smoking because they may lose some of their regular customers. I think the perfect solution is to balance the needs of both smokers and non-smokers. Restaurants could implement innovative ways to cater both smokers and non-smokers rather than enforcing a complete ban. For example, providing designated smoking areas with proper ventilation systems or smoke vacuums to ensure that non-smokers are not disturbed by the smoke. Additionally, using ashtrays or aluminium trash bins specifically for cigarette disposal to help maintain cleanliness and reduce environmental impact. For indoor dining areas, closing windows and using effective air filtration systems to prevent cigarette smoke from entering and disturbing non-smoking customers. By adopting these measures, restaurants can create an environment where all customers feel comfortable and respected. This solution would help retain loyal customers who prefer the option to smoke while dining, and ensure that they continue to enjoy their time at their favourite rertaurants.
