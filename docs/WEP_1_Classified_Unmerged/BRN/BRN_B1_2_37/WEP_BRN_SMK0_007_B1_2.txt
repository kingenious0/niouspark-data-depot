I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. There are several reasons behind this. Firstly, health concerns where the fumes or the smokes from a cigarette can be harmful to those people around. This could lead them to be a passive smoker, and affects their overal health. It is especially dangerous when these fumes are exposed to infants, younger children, pregnant woman, and old people. The smokes may also triggers breathing difficulties for people with asthma. Restaurant is a place for family bonding, a place to enjoy foods and perhaps, a place to chill. It should not be a place where someone's health could be at a risk. It should not be a place to make someone feel uncomfortable because of the smokes. It should not be a place where people cannot enjoy their time regardless of them dining alone or with others. Secondly, a restaurant is usually equipped with highly flammable appliances or things, such as gas. Smoking at a restaurant increases the risk of accidental fire, which will lead to damages and loss to the restaurat. There are incidents where restaurants caught fire just because someone had forgotten to properly dispose cigarettes. They may have been unaware that the cigarette was still lit and winds may have carried the lit cigarette to nearby electrical appliances or dry flammable materials located near the restaurants. Such incidents would not only cause a huge loss to the property of the restaurant but also concerns of the safety of the people inside the restaurant. Lastly, foods can be contaminated with the smokes or particles coming out from the cigarette, decreasing the overall quality of the food.
