I agree with the statement because smoking is clearly bad for health and it affects both the smoker and the people nearby the smoker. However, it is impossible to completely stop people from smoking when and where they want. Some restaurants allow smoking by providing outdoor dining area to accommodate smokers who would want to enjoy their meals while they smoke. If the restaurant does not accommodate smokers by banning smoking completely, it would be a financial loss to the business itself because smokers also want to dine in at restaurants and have a good time, just like non-smokers. Customers, whether they are smokers or non-smokers, are the ones who should respect the rules and others around them while they are at restaurants. If the restaurant does not allow indoor smoking, the smoker must go outside to smoke to respect the rule made by the restaurant. If the restaurant bans smoking both inside and outside the building, then smokers should respect that rule and not smoke at all. Non-smokers who dine outside should also not be offended when they find customers smoke nearby them. Pregnant women should dine inside the restaurant. If they choose to dine outside the restaurant where smoking is allowed, then they cannot be upset when they find people smoking there.
