Personally, I agree that students should take part-time jobs, especially if you are a university student. You definitely can make the time especially during semester breaks or take up jobs with flexible working hours, say like working as a Dart driver or Gomamam rider. In this current economy like Brunei, work experience is really important nowadays, as that is what most employers look for no matter the job position. Some skills you get during part-time jobs can be carried over to future positions and those new skills you learn from each new workplace during your part-time job can stack altogether and make a really make a good CV. So it makes it easier to apply similar jobs that require more similar experiences but with higher pay, say like working as a barista or tuition teaching. In addition, doing part-time work as a student also teaches you discipline, because you are learning how to properly balance work and student life, one of the favorable characteristics and skills that many employers look for. I feel like a student who has a good amount of work experiences are likely to have better chances to be employed compared to those who only focus on studying. Early exposure to work life as a student also teaches you to be humble and understand the real world before you graduate. Plus, early exposure to part-time jobs can make you more comfortable doing more part-time work in other future establishments or perhaps full-time work during the student-to-work life transition phase. Lastly, there’s satisfaction of earning your own money. Since relying on student allowances is not sustainable in the long run, having other alternatives of earning money is good, especially for emergencies, helping paying the bills or even treating yourself for your hard work.
