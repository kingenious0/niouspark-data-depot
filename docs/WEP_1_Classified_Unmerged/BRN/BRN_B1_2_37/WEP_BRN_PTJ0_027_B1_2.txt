I both agree and disagree to the statement. First, the reasons why I agree is because of the experience, income, skills and length of time working. If college students work part-time, they will have a work experience which they can write in their resume. To any employers, if college students have work experience, that could give a good impression of a hardworking person. By working at a part-time job, the students will gain many skills such as how to do tasks efficiently and co-working with others at the job. The money that the students earned by working at a part-time job can help the students financially. It is no surprise that being a college student needs money to pay for the accommodation, transportation (unless the students can walk to and from college to their home), food, tuition fee, and registration fee. When the students graduate, they will need money to rent or pay for their graduation gowns. Apart from food and transportation costs, the other stuff is costly. So the money earned from working at part-time jobs can help pay most if not all of that. Lastly, the good thing about working part-time is the length of time. Usually, part-time jobs end after 1 or 2 years. So the job commitment is not long-term. The students can move on to other jobs they like after the current one ends. Now the reasons why I disagree with the statement earlier is because of time management. It will be difficult for students to balance their time between working and studying or completing their assignments to graduate. They can become tired or sleepy when they attend their classes.
