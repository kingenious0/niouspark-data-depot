I disagree with the college students doing a part-time job. As what I had experienced looking at my college students whom I tutored, they had a part-time job like working at the Jollibee, McDonald, at the cinema, and etc. I found my students had become very exhausted when they attend classes at college. They had lack of attention in class because they said they had less sleep and their body ached due to their part-time job. As for their academic performance, normally they did not complete their homework and always did not submit their assignments. When they had examinations, they did not prepare at all and the results were always just enough to pass or they would just fail. They not only did not focus in class but I also noticed that they focussed more on their jobs than on studying. Their interest to study is getting lower each day. I understand that they enjoyed working because they received money on time every month unlike the campus allowances which were always not on time and only less than $300. Most of them even can afford to buy a second-hand car while doing a part-time job and become committed to it to pay monthly. On the positive side of doing a part-time job, the students have work experience and earn extra money so they do not depend on their allowances.
