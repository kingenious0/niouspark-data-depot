I am fully agree with this. Personally, I think it should be banned from other public places as well. Which is exactly what the Brunei government did. The problem with people smoking in public places is that they are causing inconvenience, and more importantly, harm to the surrounding people. The smoke can be uncomfortable to some people. Not just because of the smell, but because of the smoke itself. The cigarette, as we know, are harmful to us humans. The danger is even worse to the surrounding people, which is called the passive smoker. If smoking itself is harmful and highly discouraged, being a passive smoker should be even worse. Thus, justifying that it should be banned from public places. Public places is a shared space with other people. People should not act as if it is their home. Even at home, they should not harm their own family or friends by making them a passive smoker. In short, smoking around other people is discouraged for both public and private places. In my humble opinion, the Brunei government did the right thing. Any opinion stating otherwise should be rejected. People can express their opinion, but if it were up to me, I would reject the opinion after listening to it and trying to considerately understand the different perspective.
