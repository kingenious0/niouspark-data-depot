I agree that smoking should be completely banned because cigarettes are full of health-harming substances and toxic chemicals like tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide, all of which are really bad for our health. Tar can gunk up the lungs and lead to lung cancer. Nicotine is addictive, which is why people find it so hard to quit once they start. Carbon monoxide is a poisonous gas that messes with how much oxygen our blood can carry, causing heart and lung problems over time. The harm of smoking extends beyond the smokers. Second-hand smoke, which comes from both the cigarette and the smoker’s exhalation, is dangerous for anyone nearby. These passive smokers can end up with respiratory infections, heart disease, and even cancer just from being around the smoke. This makes smoking really risky in public places, especially small spaces like restaurants. Many countries have implemented a law that bans smoking in public places, including restaurants, which is great for protecting public health. Letting people smoke in public places is a bad idea for any country. Most of the world’s smokers live in low- and middle-income countries, where healthcare systems are already strained. So it’s even more important to prevent smoking-related illnesses through public health measures like smoking bans. The only thing that smoking does is mess up the lungs and put others at risk, especially in public places. That’s why I strongly believe smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants in the country. This would protect non-smokers and help reduce the number of smokers, leading to a healthier society overall.
