As someone with a deep interest in diseases, I have always been aware of the dangers and harm of smoking cigarettes. Cigarette smoke can cause lung and heart-related diseases and cancer whether you inhale it directly or passively. This is because the lungs must work extremely hard to filter the contaminated air while all the toxicants stay in the lungs and enter the bloodstream. Once the toxicants enter the bloodstream, they then contaminate the heart, brain, and other vital organs.  We can imagine how polluted the air can be if smoking is allowed inside the restaurant. The fact that restaurants are places where people of all ages come to enjoy their meals, I think everyone would agree that when we want to enjoy our meals at restaurants, we want the place to be nice and clean. Therefore, I am completely on board with the banning of smoking at all restaurants. Not just at all restaurants but at all public buildings and facilities. However, I grew up and was raised in a household where my dad was the one who smoked. When I was young, I always asked my dad why he enjoyed smoking so much. The reason is that I always watch the health advertisement on TV where a smoker’s lungs become completely damaged. I admit that I was a passive smoker because I remember inhaling the smoke when my dad was smoking outside the house. I believe that people who smoke in public areas prioritize their personal pleasure over the health risks they pose to others.
