While I do agree that having part-time jobs is important in some aspects, having them when you are still studying may sometimes cause problems to the students, as well as the people around them. Having a part-time job as students will help them in terms of gaining income, especially if they are not given monthly allowance by their schools or parents. Being a student may sometimes require quite a sum of money (i.e when conducting researches, accessing books and references for essays, and even the gas for transporting from home to college), and that does not include the money that might be used for daily needs such as food. So, in this case, I think having a part-time job would be great to aid students financially. However, this might be an individual difference, but some students may not be able to manage their time with school work and their part-time job efficiently. Being too busy with work might disrupt their main responsibility as a student, leaving no time for them to do their assignments and some might even not attend classes in order to cover their shifts. Additionally, this might also affect the students around them. Based on my experience, for one of our projects in class, I was once in a group with someone who had a part-time job. The journey was not easy as I had to continuously pester them to finish their part while I did most of the work, since they were too busy with their part-time job. I thought it was unfair on my part. Having a part-time job might be important, mainly to help the students financially but it might have negative outcomes if one does not know how to manage their time efficiently.
