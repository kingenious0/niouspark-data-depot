I disagree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. Firstly, I appreciate the health concerns related to smoking and the importance of protecting non-smokers, but I believe that there could be a more balanced approach to solve the rights of smokers and non-smokers. Perhaps it is by having designated areas for smoking outdoors so that non-smokers can dine inside the restaurants. If restaurants do this, it could provide a compromise that respects the preferences of both smokers and non-smokers. At the same time, it could increase the business profits earned by the restaurants because it would attract more customers to come and dine there. By allowing on-site smoking, restaurants should also take into account the health and safety of their staff and the areas. This means that only staff who are comfortable with smoking can serve food and beverages in the smoking area. The staff should also be aware of the disposal of the cigarette butts to ensure that they are properly unlit. The restaurants should also keep both indoor and outdoor dining areas clean. It is also important to consider the potential impact of banning smoking on businesses because a total ban could affect the overall dining experience and customer satisfaction. Customers who used to enjoy smoking at the restaurants might no longer come to dine there.
