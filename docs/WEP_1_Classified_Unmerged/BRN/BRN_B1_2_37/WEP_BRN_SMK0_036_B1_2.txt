I 100% agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country because nothing good comes from smoking. First and foremost, smoking in restaurants carries serious health risks not only to smokers but also to non-smokers especially pregnant women and people with respiratory problems. Secondhand smoke is more dangerous because it can cause heart disease, lung disease, and even cancer. When people go out to enjoy a meal, they should not be exposed to harmful toxins that could jeopardize their health. People should be able to enjoy good food and good company in a clean and pleasant environment without their taste of food being ruined by the smoke. In its common sense, the main reason why smoking is banned in restaurants is to encourage more people to quit smoking. In a way, if smoking is causing inconvenience to smokers, they may find it much easier to cut back or quit smoking altogether. This could lead to a healthier population overall and at the same time reduces the burden on healthcare systems and improve public health. On the other hand, people who are against the ban might say that it's too much government control and takes away the personal freedoms of people who choose to smoke. But they are still allowed in their private homes so that’s still their freedom.
