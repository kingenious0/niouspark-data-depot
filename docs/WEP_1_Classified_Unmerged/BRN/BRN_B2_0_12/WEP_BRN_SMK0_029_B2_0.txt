I agree. Since Brunei is one of the countries that have banned public smoking, I am grateful to not have encountered a single person smoking in public places including restaurants. If a person is caught possessing cigarettes, they will be fined. There are no benefits from smoking cigarettes. Smoking will slowly destroy the lungs, skin, teeth, and appearance. It’s like killing the body slowly. Smoking in restaurants ruins the environment of the restaurants. The smoke will travel in the air and get inhaled by those who are eating and drinking or chatting at the restaurants. That can destroy the taste of the food and drink, and people can cough because of the smoke. That is not a nice experience at all. Smokers should also consider the health and safety of others so if they want to smoke, they should do that in their own space alone. After they are done with smoking, they should dispose of the cigarettes properly. Although smokers claim that smoking can instantly relieve their stress, but how can they be not stressed when they are actually burning their own money. They have to buy the lighter and the cigarettes, so they are actually losing money. They are killing their own finance, health, and beauty, which I think is really stupid. If someone is smoking near me while I am eating at a restaurant, I will call the waiter to wrap up my food to take home and leave the restaurant.
