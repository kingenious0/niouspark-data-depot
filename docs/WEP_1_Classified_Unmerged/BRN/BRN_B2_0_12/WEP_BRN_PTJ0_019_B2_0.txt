In my opinion, college is when you transition from being a teenager to a young adult for a lot of people, so it is important for college students to have a part-time job to gain experience. It does not have to be specific or related to what they are studying as the experience is not limited to working but also life. I cannot say for those who landed a job through connections, however even getting one has its processes, like stages in life. For example, a student would first need to search for a job depending on their preferences or the situation they are in. Once they found an appropriate one, they would need to apply. Otherwise, send in their resume. If they are noticed, they will need to go through interviews and once they get accepted, they will need to learn the company’s standards of procedure. Another thing is learning how to work with people, like working with the higher-ups, setting up boundaries between coworkers, dealing with diverse types of customers and so on. Having a part-time job while studying may also help with time management as the student would need to plan out their schedule around the classes, assignments, and their shifts. While having a part-time job that is in line with their majors can be beneficial, experience is much more valuable. After all, that is what employers usually seek.
