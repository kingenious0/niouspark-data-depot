The prohibition of smoking in public spaces has long been established in major public areas, and for the most part has been accepted by the wider society, even by smokers themselves. The banning of smoking at restaurants can be bad for businesses, as it makes the space less welcome to families with smaller children. This could in turn lead to negative effects on businesses and restaurant establishments. Further, the scientific evidence of passive smoking and its effects to a passive smoker’s health is another reason why smoking in public places, especially places where customers are to eat in, are why smoking should be banned at restaurants. Lastly, smoking in general is a habit that is directly detrimental to a smoker’s health. The act of smoking in public by other smokers might not encourage quitters to relapse or defeat the purpose of an ex-smoker quitting by turning them into passive smokers. However, there are some who may argue that banning smokers from restaurants may also be bad for restaurant businesses. This may be so in a case where smokers and their friends may use public spaces and restaurants to socialize and bond. This argument could easily be debunked when considering that smokers could easily opt to smoke in private spaces.
