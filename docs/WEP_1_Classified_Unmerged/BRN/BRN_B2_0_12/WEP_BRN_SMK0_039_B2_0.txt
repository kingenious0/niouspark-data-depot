I think smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants in the country to protect people's health, enhance the dining experience, and keep the environment clean. First off, looking out for public health is super important, especially in restaurants where people of all age gather to enjoy their meals. Secondhand smoke is seriously bad for non-smokers because it contains toxic chemicals that can cause respiratory issues, heart disease, and lung cancer. By getting rid of smoking in restaurants, we can reduce non-smokers' exposure to these harmful substances, like kids and other vulnerable old people, and keep them safe. Also, having a smoke-free environment makes the overall dining experience way better for customers. The smell of tobacco smoke can be gross and ruin people's meals. Many non-smokers prefer to eat in places where there is no smoke. Restaurants can create a more welcoming and comfy atmosphere for everyone by banning smoking. This can lead to happier customers. Lastly, a smoking ban in restaurants would help keep the place clean and pleasant, both indoors and outdoors. Cigarette butts are everywhere, making a mess and polluting the environment. Banning smoking would cut down on the litter, making public spaces cleaner and more attractive for diners. Plus, the absence of smoke would make the air quality better, making the whole dining experience fresher and more enjoyable for everyone.
