Yes, somewhat because it’s important because it helps with students to get experience and get acclimated to working conditions. It’s also good because it helps with getting some money on the side. But it shouldn’t be too much effort that it takes away time for students to study, or that it becomes a distraction. Even so I think that getting experience might be good to put in a CV. Personally I’ve never pushed myself to get one, but from hearing my friend’s stories it might be really difficult to juggle studies and a job, especially with families asking for help a lot. I think an example could be getting a part-time job as a barista. You would learn ways to make coffee and probably stuff about hospitality since you would work in the food and beverage industry. Another good part-time job could be interning at companies, because you could learn and get hands-on experience in your field. Again I’ve heard stories about interns being asked to do real mundane stuff so it’s a coin toss for whether you would get anything out of it. So conceptually it’s good, but in execution it could be really difficult, since a lot of factors could change your experience.
