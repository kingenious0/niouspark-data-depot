I agree because not all college students are given incentives such as scholarships that could alleviate potential financial problems while they are attending college. As a college student myself, I understand the problems a college student may face, and the most common problem is finance. Even though I was given a local scholarship, the allowance is not enough to help pay the cost that exceeds the given allowance. One experience was the repair cost of the cooling compartment of my car which cost about $500+ and that was not enough with the allowance I was given. So, my dad helped pay part of the costs and I would have to pay him back with next month’s allowance. Having a part-time job can ease the stress of financial problems. The one advantage is learning how to manage your finances. It’s not too early to learn about managing finances, especially as a college student, we are at the age where we are considered adults and by the time, we have graduated, we would be released to the outside world. Finances is not something to underestimate so it’s better to learn early. Having a part-time job can be a reason to start learning about managing finances especially when given our first paycheck and learning about savings and even potentially how to gain more money for our current self and the future as well.
