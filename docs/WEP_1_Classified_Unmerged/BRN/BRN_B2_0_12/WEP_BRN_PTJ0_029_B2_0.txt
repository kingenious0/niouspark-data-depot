I disagree. Being a college student is already an occupation. The student has to attend classes like lectures and tutorials for many modules. One student can have up to six modules per semester at Universiti Brunei Darussalam. One module will have one lecture and one tutorial every week. That means six modules will have six lectures and six tutorials each week. Each module will have assignments like an oral presentation, written report or essays, and examination. That means for one student, he or she will have six lectures and six tutorials to attend every week and have to find the time to study for assignments. I think that is too much of a workload for one student and being a student, finishing the study is much more important. If the student works for a part-time job, how can they find the time to balance both studying and working? Unless that student is a genius then I think studying is not a daunting task for them. Many students have failed their modules because they don’t attend lectures or tutorials and submit their assignments on time. This is an issue itself. In a course of 20 students, less than 10 will pass the module. Those who failed the module will have to take the same module again in the next semester. Some of those students chose to quit university before graduating because they can’t cope with the workload. So I think that is why having a part-time job is not important while being a college student.
