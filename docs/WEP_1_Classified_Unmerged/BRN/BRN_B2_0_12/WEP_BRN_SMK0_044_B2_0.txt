I agree that smoking should be completely banned. It is a well-known fact that smoking is dangerous and harmful to both the smokers and the people around the smokers. It only makes sense to ban smoking in public places, including all restaurants in the country. It is a slow killer of our health because the effects of smoking are not immediate but the results are always the same, that is it can lead to complications such as heart and lung disease. It also affects second-hand smokers even though they are not the actual smokers but the harmful substances enter their bloodstreams once inhaled. It is not fair for non-smokers to have their health destroyed. Usually, restaurants are where families with small children may dine. Because smoking pollutes the air and the smell gets trapped in fabric and liquids, it ruins the quality of the environment and dining experience. This will only make it unpleasant, especially when eating at a restaurant where it is usually indoors or within closed walls. Other than that, cigarette butts are often littered. The butts take time a long time to decompose and are toxic to the environment. The appearance of the littered place is also affected and unpleasant to the eyes. Overall, smoking should be banned because it is harmful to the health and environment as it pollutes air, water, and land. Even so, I understand that smokers might find it difficult to quit smoking so there can be designated smoking areas, but it should not be at restaurants.
