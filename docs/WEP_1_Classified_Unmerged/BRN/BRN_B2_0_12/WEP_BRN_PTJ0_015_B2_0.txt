Acquiring a part-time job as a college student is a decision some students may face in the midst of studenthood. The incentive of part-time jobs for a student is easily the financial perks and experience they gain, but the downside to part-time jobs is the need for discipline to balance out both schoolwork and the part-time job description. It is important for college students to have part time jobs as it teaches students about hard work, introduces students to real-life situations that they will face after graduating, to preventing the ‘culture shock’ factor as they transition from becoming students. However, part-time jobs can also be tiring both physically and mentally. This can lead to other effects on the student’s health such as the feeling of burn-out, not being able to cope with their college studies and workload and losing the or work and school life balance. Overall, it could be argued that to have a part-time job is more ideal – mainly because it teaches the student to gain discipline which could easily cross out factors such as lack of student and work-life balance. Another option might be to take hours off from the part-time job when crucial school dates such as exams are around the corner.
