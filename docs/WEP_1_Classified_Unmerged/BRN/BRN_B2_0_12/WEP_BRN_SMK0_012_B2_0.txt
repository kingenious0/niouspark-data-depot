I think yes because we’ve been taught early on that passive smoking is a thing and it’s pretty devastating to kids and compromised people. Not only that it’s just going to make a restaurant feel really stuffy and smelly. As an asthmatic, the smoke does trigger my asthma so my opinion is very biased. I do get that social smoking and leisure smoking is a thing but it does affect the people around you. Plus I reckon the cigarette smell also affects the ambience of a restaurant so it’ll change how your food tastes. I don’t like saying this but if kids see people openly smoking it’ll probably get them curious, but I don’t think it’s that much of an influence. The only thing that is quite scary is passive smoking because if restaurants do allow smoking and people eat out a lot, some effects could build up and affect other people's health. The only compromise could be having smoking rooms, or just having the people smoke outside for others' sake. But overall I do think that restaurants should ban smoking inside premises because it could affect other’s health and probably their dining experience as well. People can smoke outside if they want.
