Smoking has been proven to be harmful to both the user and the people around it, so it is only right that it is completely banned at all restaurants in the country. It is damaging to our health as it can lead to complications such as heart and lung disease. It also affects second-hand smokers even though they are not the actual smokers which would not be ideal, especially in restaurants where families with small children, pregnant women, and asthmatic people may be present. Even more, smoking pollutes the air, and the smell gets trapped into fabric, food, and liquids. This will only make it unpleasant, especially when eating at a restaurant where it is usually indoors or within closed walls. Other than that, cigarette butts are often littered. Those take time to decompose, can be toxic to the environment, and only reduce the value of the place where it is littered as it affects the aesthetics of the area. Overall, smoking should be banned because it is harmful to the health and environment as it pollutes air and land. Regardless, I understand that quitting smoking can be difficult so there can be designated smoking areas, but it should not be legal in public places such as restaurants.
