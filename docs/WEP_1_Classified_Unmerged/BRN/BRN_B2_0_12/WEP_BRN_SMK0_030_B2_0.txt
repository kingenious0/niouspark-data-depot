I agree with this because smoking is harmful wherever we do it. It doesn’t matter if you smoke outside of restaurants or alone at your home, smoking is harmful for our health and the environment. The smoke can cause health problems not only to the smoker, but also to the other people who indirectly breathe in the smoke. These health problems can be lung cancer, breathing problems, teeth problems, or skin problems. The harmful smoke can pollute the air and the cigarette waste can pollute the land. Overall, it is not a pleasant sight to see and smell to breathe. Smoking can also cause personal relationship problems with others. Pregnant wives may not like it when their husbands smoke because the harmful smoke can get inhaled by the wives and can cause the unborn baby to develop abnormalities. Even unmarried couples can fight or end their relationship because one of the partners is smoking. In restaurants especially, people usually dine in to have a good time. Smoking at restaurants can pollute the clean air of the restaurants and people with breathing problems can cough uncontrollably. The people dining there can become annoyed and angry at the smokers and also at the restaurant staff or managers for allowing smoking. The taste of the food and drinks, the quality of the air to breathe, and the mood of the people all are ruined.
