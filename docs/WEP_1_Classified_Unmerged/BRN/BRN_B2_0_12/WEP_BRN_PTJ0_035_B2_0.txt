No. I disagree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. College students have a lot of studying and assignments to complete before the end of each semester. Depending on the programme of study, different students have different lengths of study. Studying, completing assignments, and preparing for the final exam can be stressful and require hours of focus and dedication. If students have jobs while they are still attending college, they may have less hours to spend on their studies and their personal resting time. Students also need a lot of rest and peer support to help with their studies, and having jobs could take that personal time and support away. Rather than having jobs, I think that having a balance between studying and personal time is much more important. Students should dedicate themselves to activities that they find enjoyable, relaxing, or fulfilling, such as hobbies, exercise, reading, meditation, or simply resting. Personal time is important for maintaining a healthy college-life balance, reducing stress, and improving overall well-being. If the students have to work in addition to attending college, they won’t be able to find quality time to decompress each day because both studying and working can be stressful and tiring. Although having a job has its benefits such as earning money, time management skills, communication skills, and work experience, students must have a strong mentality to be able to work and study at the same time. It is not easy but many have successfully done it, and it is also okay to do one thing at a time and prioritise health and well-being.
