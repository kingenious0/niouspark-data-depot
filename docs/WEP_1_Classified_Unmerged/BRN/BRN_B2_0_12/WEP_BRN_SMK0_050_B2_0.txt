Smoking should definitely be banned in all restaurants across the country and the biggest reason is the harm it causes. Even if just one person is smoking, the biggest issue is the passive smoking. This means that everyone else in the restaurant is breathing in the secondhand smoke which can be just as harmful as smoking directly. This includes problems like breathing difficulties, heart and lung disease and cancer. It's a major health risk for everyone in the restaurant, regardless of their age or gender. Restaurants are supposed to be places where people go to relax and enjoy a good meal. The last thing anyone wants is to deal with the smoke from cigarettes while they are trying to eat. The smell of smoke can ruin the atmosphere of the place. Not only that it is unpleasant, it can actually make people lose their appetite because their good mood is ruined. Imagine sitting down for a nice meal only to be overwhelmed by the smell of cigarettes. Nobody wants that. Nobody wants to eat in a place where the air smells like an ashtray. Allowing smoking can hurt the restaurant’s reputation. If people start complaining about the smoke and how it affects their dining experience, you can bet that negative reviews will follow. The restaurant will be cancelled. The restaurant will lose customers and drop in sales. Smoking in restaurants is not just a matter of personal choice because it affects everyone who walks through the door. It's about creating a pleasant and healthy environment for everyone.
