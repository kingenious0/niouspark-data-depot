I agree because not every college student is lucky enough to get scholarships or other financial help to ease the burden while they are in college. As I was a fee-paying student myself, I understand how tough it can be to save money for my own needs and to pay my tuition fee. Although my parents helped pay the fees at the beginning so I could attend university, they also taught me to work to pay them back little by little. So I had to work part-time to earn money so I can pay my parents back slowly. Apart from paying the tuition fee, I had to save money for car repairs and food. Luckily I never had to pay for anything or buy other necessities throughout my undergrad years. One of the best things about having a part-time job as a student is that it pushes you to start managing your money and teaches you to be responsible. It’s never too early to get a grip on your finances, especially when you’re in college and starting to take on more adult responsibilities. I’m grateful that my parents taught me early to act like adults, such as dealing with bills, rent, and everything else that comes with being independent because that’s how it is in the real world. Another thing is that I’m lucky that I could always find the time to study for assignments and exams so my academic performance was not affected even though I had to work. I was able to attend lectures and tutorials because I managed my own schedule. My free time was spent on studying and revising for exams.
