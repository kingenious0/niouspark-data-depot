I both agree and disagree on this because there are advantages and disadvantages to having a part-time job while studying at college. Having a part-time job can boost the student’s work experience, social skills, and financial support. With work experience, the student can form a social network for his or her career opportunities after graduating from college. Let’s say that the student worked part-time as a barista, he or she may get another opportunity as a full-time barista at a better coffee shop with a higher salary. Some workplaces present awards to the staff so if the student has a great work performance, he or she may get the award and that can boost the student’s work achievement. The manager or boss of the workplace may suggest better opportunities. Of course money is an important reason why students work part-time so they can support themselves without burdening their parents. The disadvantages of having a job while being a student is the time management and stress from doing so much in a day. The student’s energy can decrease after a day of working and studying and he or she may not get enough rest at night. Balancing both working and studying can also deprive the student of the freedom of hanging out with friends and taking part in extracurricular activities. This can lead to the student feeling burnout and stress because of the overwhelming burden of both working and studying. In conclusion, I cannot decide which one is better but it all depends on the will and determination of the student.
