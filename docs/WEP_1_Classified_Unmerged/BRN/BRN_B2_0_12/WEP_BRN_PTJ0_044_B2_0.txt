I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job to gain work experience. Studying at college is the final step before entering the real world of working, so having part-time jobs can prepare for that transition. This experience is not just about building professional skills for their resume, but also about personal growth. Personal growth is the experience of being independent and responsible and developing crucial skills such as time management and money saving. I realize that the job search process can be challenging, and even landing a job through personal connections involves its own set of experiences that parallel those of life. It can be daunting to search for a job and go through the application and interview process. Once hired, there is a lot to learn. It is not going to be just about the job itself but also about interpersonal skills and time management while juggling work and studies. I believe that having a part-time job can provide an important experience that employers value regardless of its relevance to one's major at college. It is important for students to remember that they are not alone in navigating the journey from college to the professional world.
