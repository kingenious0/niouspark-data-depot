I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. The main reason for this is the health risks associated with secondhand smoke. It is well-known that exposure to secondhand smoke can cause many health problems such as lung infections, heart disease, and lung cancer. By banning smoking in restaurants, it can protect the health of non-smokers, including children and employees, and also make the dining experience better. By not having the unpleasant smoke in restaurants, it can make the atmosphere more welcoming for everyone. This also supports the shift towards healthier lifestyles. Although smokers may feel that the banning of smoking takes away their rights to smoke but non-smokers also have the right to not want to get the harmful effects of secondhand smoke. Smokers should be more responsible about when, where, and how they smoke. If they want to smoke, they can smoke alone in their own space and they should throw away the butts in a ceramic bin or metal bin. Smoking not only pollutes the air for breathing but it also pollutes the environment. The improper disposal of the butts can get washed into the sea and ocean, clogs the drains, and cause fires.
