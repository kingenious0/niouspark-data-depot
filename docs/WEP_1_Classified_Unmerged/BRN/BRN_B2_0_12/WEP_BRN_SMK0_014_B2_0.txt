Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant in the country where the agreeable reason is the harm it causes. Although only one customer is smoking in the restaurant, the concept of passive smoking exists where other people breathe in the fumes from the cigarette. It has the same effect as a smoker: difficulty breathing, heart disease, cancer etc. The restaurant is a public space where everyone comes over to rest and enjoy a meal and passive smoking affects everyone no matter their age or gender. It is also important to mention that the smell of smoke may disturb the environment of the restaurant because no one would want to smell the smoke fumes while trying to eat their food. The smell, of course, would disturb everyone’s mood and their appetite. Adding on to that, this will also affect the restaurant’s popularity as everyone would comment whether or not the restaurant is good. In a scenario where smokers are allowed, the situation as I mentioned about the smell would then certainly happen, leading to negative reviews and comments about the restaurant and then the restaurant may lose its sells. Smoking is known to be harmful especially to those that are not even smokers themselves. So, a restaurant should consider if smoking is allowed.
