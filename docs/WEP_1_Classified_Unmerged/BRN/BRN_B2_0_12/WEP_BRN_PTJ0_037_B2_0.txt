I would say that I’m neutral on this because of many reasons. First, while it is important for college students to have a part-time job if they need extra money, they also must be able to balance studying and working. Attending university requires money for car fuel, food, stationeries, and other important items like a laptop. Second, while having a work experience is important for when the students apply for jobs after they graduate, juggling between working and studying can be overwhelming and stressful. The students may not have personal free time to escape work or their assignments. If they have upcoming exams, that will be even more stressful. Some employers at part-time jobs may not let the students be absent from work just because of having exams. I think it would be much better if the students can find flexible jobs that suit their schedules. Third, having a part-time job gives the students life skills and knowledge that they won’t acquire from studying at college. These skills depend on where they work. If the students really enjoy working at their jobs, they may think that the skills they obtain from college are not necessary. They may decide to quit college all of a sudden and that means they won’t receive a qualification of higher education. Based on these reasons, I would say that the students must be able to juggle both attending college and working for them to be successful at both. If they can’t do that, it is okay to focus on one occupation at a time.
