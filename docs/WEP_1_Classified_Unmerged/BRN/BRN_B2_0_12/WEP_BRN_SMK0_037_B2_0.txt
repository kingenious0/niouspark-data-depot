I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. In fact, smoking should be banned completely in all places in every country. Not only does it protect non-smokers from secondhand smoke, but it also creates a healthier and more pleasant environment for everyone. In other countries where smoking can still be done publicly, it is not healthy for others who breathe in the smoke. Even if smoking is done privately, it is not healthy for the smokers themselves. Smoking is destroying the lungs and heart so I can never understand why people smoke. Restaurants that offer smoking areas are restaurants that only want to get more financial gain and do not care about the safety and health of the staff and customers. Of course, smokers have the right to smoke whenever and wherever they want, but it can’t be denied that smoking only contributes to air pollution, littering, and serious health concerns, which is why it is better banned. Smokers should take the initiative from the inconvenience of public smoking to quit smoking. They should do healthier and safer activities like jogging, swimming, or gardening, so they no longer want to smoke. Some smokers just want something to chew on something to quit smoking. They can chew on sugar-free gums or nuts which are healthier.
