Yes I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Brunei has banned public smoking since the mid-2000s if I’m not mistaken and I have never encountered a single person smoking publicly or in restaurants because they will be fined. Brunei is pretty strict in adhering to the no-smoking law, which includes the banning of selling and owning cigarettes and vapes. I think the law is beneficial for everyone’s health and the environment not only in Brunei but also for the Earth’s health. The implementation of the no-smoking law has reduced the risk of Bruneians of getting lung cancer and respiratory diseases while also purifying the air in Brunei. Although some smokers would still buy tobacco sneakily in Brunei through the Brunei-Miri and Brunei-Limbang borders, they still abide by the law by only smoking at private places like their homes and throwing away the ends responsibly. The “no smoking or vaping allowed” signs are displayed on the walls in all Brunei restaurants so that’s already a clear rule that everyone must follow. Of course it’s hard to control everyone from not smoking especially when they are in their own homes and events, but smokers can still be responsible about it and not involve anybody else by smoking alone. That way no one else is affected by the harmful effects of inhaling the smoke.
