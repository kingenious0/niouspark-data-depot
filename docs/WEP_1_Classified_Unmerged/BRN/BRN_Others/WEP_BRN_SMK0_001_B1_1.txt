I would say disagree because some restaurants have outdoor and indoor place to eat, so some people in café or restaurant would like to relax and spend more time with smoking and hangout with their friend especially after work or weekend. If all restaurants in the country banned smoking some of these customers don’t want to go there again just because cannot smoking especially after eating they would find some good spot just to have smoke, some people say that is a perfect time for smoke. This type of customers sometimes will go to other place if the restaurant banned smoking. So banned smoking in restaurants maybe will also decrease customers. For environment, if they don’t want smoking to be banned they would have to make some good idea to make all customers in the restaurant feel good and safe. Example to put an ash tray or aluminium trash for the cigarette, and for the smoke some good idea is they have to put some smoke vaccum so other people who don’t smoking will not smell the smoke. For the indoor, they have to close all window so customers who eat at indoor doesn’t feel disturb by the people who smoke on outside. So actually,  smoking in restaurants is not the thing that you have banned but people who smoking in the restaurants can be controlled by some genius idea. So restaurant that have loyal customers doesn’t go to a new place just because cannot smoke.
