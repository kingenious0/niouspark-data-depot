Yes I agree, because some students need more money to buy food or fuel to continue to go to school. Even all student has been given allowance from school maybe they will need more money to be saved for future money or for an emergency use. Some student got lucky because of their parents gave them extra money for school but still they cannot save the money. However, student with own vehicle also need to give some maintenance to their car for everyday use. As a student, they also need to know how to find money since they are still young. They will have a hard time if one day the students get graduated, some of them will know how hard to find a permanent job. If one day they get stuck with no job, other things to do to continue their life or get money is by doing their own business from zero. No matter how hard they have start the business they need to continue as long as to continue their life. We know some people get lucky and easy to find a job, some people get hard even they try so many times to apply to the company. So that is why college students need to have part-time job. Part-time job has been teaching them how to find money and how hard is life in the next level.
