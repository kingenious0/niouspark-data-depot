I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Although it may be controversial, I believe that there are more reasons that outweigh the potential drawbacks. Firstly, due to the importance of the public health. Things such as secondhand smoke from smoking can harm the health of people who don't smoke. By banning smoking in restaurants, they can protect both their customers and restaurant workers from unnecessary health risks which include risk of respiratory problems, heart disease, and various types of cancers. Also, many people may prefer smoke free environments when they go to eat in a restaurants. Banning smoking in restaurants can create a much better dining experience for everyone. As an example, for restaurant employees, by banning smoking would create a safer and healthier workplace and this can improve their well-being and job satisfaction as well. Another reason is that banning smoking can reduce cleaning and maintenance costs for restaurant since smoke leaves behind ash, burnt furniture and bad smells that may require additional cleaning and repairs, which can be expensive, therefore by banning smoking they can cut down unnecessary costs and generate more profits.
