I agree that smoking should be  banned at all type of restaurants, because restaurant is place where we can enjoy the precious breakfast, lunch or dinner with someone especially beloved ones. Another concern of this going to be problems related to health, which means not only active smoking but also passive smoking that is crusial to concern. Smoking in public place specially in restaurant makes a lot of problems, such as air pollution and rising global warming, harming other people, annoyance from other guests. So country should protect people, guests of restaurant from smoke fume at any cost. If they can implement this, that country going to have a healthy environment. Unless if they can't ban smoking in restaurants, Restaurants should have smoking room seperately from their main hall. That is goiing to help a lot for distribution, pollution of smoking fume in this area. Also implementing smokng room idea, restaurant owners will not lose their money by losing active smoker guests. In conclusion smoking in the restaurants has a lot of side effects including health problem, other guests satisfaction. It shouldn't be banned completely if that restaurant have smoking room or area which placed seperately from main meal serving place. It is good that country decision makers should look into it and take action in short time.
