Nowadays a lot of students around the world, especially university or college students used to do a part-time job during their free times. The number of youths among Mongolians, who did or doing part time job has been increasing rapidly and this shows that perspectives of people has changed, compared 19-20th century. However, there are still few, who argue that part-time job is waste of time; students should only focus on their study and education. Personally, I do believe part-time emplyoment is crucial for youths. There is a few reasons, why I support part-time job, which will be explained in the following paragraphs. First of all, part-time job is opportunity to develop yourself. Dear reader, you must be wondering how particular job can influence in personal development. So, in any jobs person will face different difficulties, obstacles, beginning from unethical rude customer. In this situation, for example, employee will learn how to communicate with different types of people who have different personality; how to manage them; and the most important- they will obtain will-power to overcome these difficulties. Secondly, it is a great chance to obtain experience. All of us know that the companies always aks about our previous experiences, and even if I have only one, this will be one big advantage of me and I will have a higher chance to get a job in that company. At last but not least, it is money. I think I can not pass this thing, since the money is one of the most important requirements to be happy and qualify our life. Having own salary and apprtoving parents that we are already mature enought to feed ourself is a dream of most of us. In conclusion, I want to advice to younger population that you need to have this experience of part-time job at least once.
