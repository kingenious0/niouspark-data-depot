 Most of the people believe that part-time job is crucial for college students. I completely agree with this statement. Because as students making money by 
themselves, they stop asking for money from their parents for daily basis. Moreover they will start feeling more independent and comportable about themselves. 
Since everyone values the education in this century, almost most of the university tuition fee are very hight. When university students have part-time work, they
 can cover at least some part of their study expenses which can lessen the pressure on their parents. So that not only students can benefit from the money that 
they are earning from part time job but also they can help their family by not always asking money which is huge financial burden on their parents and relatives. 
In additionally, as students provided by part-time job they can have sense of pride about how they are managing their daily life financial situation. In the meantime they 
can spend their money on whatever they want which is the expression of independence. In contrast, if students would work full time while studying in college they 
cannot earn enough education because of lack of time dedication for class. All in all, when college students have part time job they would still have time to spend on 
class work while earning money for living which can affect their self-esteem in a positive way.  In the mean time they stop begging for big amount of money from family 
all the time.
