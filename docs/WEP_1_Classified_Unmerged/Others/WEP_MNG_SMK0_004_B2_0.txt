Nowadays, a lot of restaurants banned smoking, even in the VIP rooms. But why? Is it not personal right to do whatever he or she wants to do? So, there are several reasons that banning smoking at restaurant is completely right and I absolutely hundred percent agree with them. Firstly, it is unethical. Ofcourse some smokers might argue that it is their right. But they should know duty as well as their right. What is their duty. To respect other and behave properly in social places. Secondly, as all of us know, smoking is venom that negatively affect our body, not only respiratory system, but also cardiovascular and neurological system. However, the most terrific thing is that these particles of ciggarette more strongly intoxicate those who did not smoke, just inhaled it. Also, we should remember that there might be some that have severe respiratory problems like COPD or asthma. Hence, ciggarette particles can cause life-threatening emergency situations to these innocent people. At last, the restaurant is the place where people enjoy the delicacies. Therefore, smell of smoking can decrease the others appetite and satisfaction.
