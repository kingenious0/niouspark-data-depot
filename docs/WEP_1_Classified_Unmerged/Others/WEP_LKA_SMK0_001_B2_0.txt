"There are many ways for a person's life to end and no one actually knows the exact time that they wil die. Although many of these ways are caused by self-action, one of which is smoking. Smoking can harm one's body and life style in many ways.
For starters smoking causes lung cancer in many people due to the sooth particles that fill up your lungs, this damages your lungs and makes it hard to breath. This causes a lot of pain to a person. So in a way we willingly reduce our life span just for temporary pleasure.
There are more disadvantages to smoking that doesn't directly affect our body, there are many ways to smoke in the modern time such as cigarettes, vapes and etc. These are not given for free so they cost money, may not cost a lot but many people get addicted to smoking so repeated purchases of these items ends up being a great sum of money spent on reducing your life span.
Many people that smoke are people that are stressed since smoking has a way of you to feel pleasure when you do it and stress free. So some people see it fine to smoke after a long day of work where they had to undergo a lot of stress.
 Even though I think that smoking should be banned in resturaunts, since this will make people that are not smoke passively smoke when others around them smoke.
