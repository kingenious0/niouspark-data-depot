"I strongly believe that it is important for College students to have a part time job. This is because part time jobs are essential for students to build up work experience and can also allow students to learn the hardships they will face to make a living in the future. 
It is abundantly clear that today, it is very much impossible to apply and be accepted for a job without any prior work experience. When an employer sees that a fresh graduate does not have any previous experience, they will feel reluctant to hire them for it will take extensive training and time to have the new employee work effectively and integrate into the company. Therefore they are more likely to select another candidate with more experience. By working in a part time job during the years a student spends at university, the student can build up the much needed work experience to rise above the competition.
 The part time job will also allow the student to get a better idea and feeling of what it is like to have to got to work regularly. The added bonus of the money they earn can also be used as an investment for their future. 
Therefore for the above mentioned reasons, I believe it is important for a student to have a part time job."
