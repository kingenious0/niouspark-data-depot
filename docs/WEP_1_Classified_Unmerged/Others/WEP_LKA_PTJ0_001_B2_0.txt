"Many students attend to college to improve their education to move forward in a career or to start their dream career. In the later situation the student will have to depend on their parents or some sponsor to aid their college funds. In some cases the college fees are very high and since not all students that attend college have excellent grades in their high school exams, majority of them will not get a scholarship.
This means that the full financial weight of the college fees will fall on the party that is sponsoring which in many cases is the parents. If the student works part time he or she will be able to assist with the payments. The fact that they will be working part time means this will allow them to make money at the same time, they will have plenty of time to focus on their studies.
There are more reasons as to why working part time can be useful, such as getting work experience, this will also allow you to socialize more people and get a sense of how a work environment will feel like.
It is not to say that there aren't any cons of a college student working part time, one of them would be the heavy amount of stress that this student will feel having to balance work life with their studies and won't have much time to relax or enjoy their college life.
I still agree that a college student should work part time since the pros of it outweigh the cons, also since there are ways to manage the cons on this.
