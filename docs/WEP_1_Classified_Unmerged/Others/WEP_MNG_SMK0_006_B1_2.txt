Even if it's not mentioned, people know the possible damage to human health from smoking. As a non-smoker, I completely agree with the idea of banning public smoking, especially in restaurants. It is a good thing that people are becoming more aware of the fact that secondhand smoke causes unwanted effects on the human body just like firsthand smoking does. By prohibiting smoking in the restaurant, the working environment for the employees will be less dangerous and the whole dining experience for the customers will be of a higher quality. First of all, letting employees breathe cigarette smoke for a long period can be considered a workplace violation. If a worker gets sick from being exposed to cigarette toxins, the employer will have to fund their health problems. In this matter, simply banning cigarettes in their restaurants can solve the problem, which is both advantageous to the employee and the employer.Second of all, family-friendly eateries would attract more customers. I bet people don't want their little kids to be in a place full of smokers, breathing the same air, watching them, and learning from them. Even for adults, being surrounded by smokers can lead to a loss of appetite. To conclude, not allowing cigarettes in restaurants can benefit the workers, the customers, and even the owner.
