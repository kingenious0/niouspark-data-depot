Some people believe that prohibiting smoke in all restaurant is one of the best way to stay healthy and clean. i completely agree with this idea because not only smoke smells extremely disgusting and left as litter on the floor  but also all ingredients in it is toxic for human health. Since restautants serve for all ages of people even for children, this kind of places required to be the cleanest and safest zone for guests including free from smoking. If smoking would be allowed in restaurant area, people who do not smoke would be exposed to secondhand smoke which is being toxicated more than the one who is smoking. Needless to say there are many survey done from world health organization about how toxic  and not healthy smoke really is which can cause many different types of cancer. In the mean time, as limiting people from smoke around food zone,  we can prevent  from littering and gross smell from smoke which make restaurants look very bad creates gross odor.  All in all, Since there is nothing essential and healthy effact about smoke, we should start to ban smoking around the restaurant zone where we are supposed to  eat  delicious and healthy food in a comfortable safe environment.
