We have important meetings in our lives, agree together, family and loved ones go out to eat at restaurants. It is most important to eat in a clean and comfortable place, to talk and enjoy the food with great culture. At the door of the related restaurant, toilet, there is an idea that  smoking is prohibited . It is very correct. Cigarette smoke contains many kinds of chemicals, because if someone smokes in the workplace, the environment will be polluted with cigarette smoke, which will not only affect the comfort of people in the customer's area, but also smoking in the employee's quarters and the kitchen area will cause pollution in the cooking process, food safety, there is a risk of loss of safe living space, fire and explosion. I worked as a waitress in a restaurant for 3 months, and the company contract states that smoking is prohibited in the workplace. This is stipulated in the law of our country. Once, in the restaurant where I worked, a person smoked and disturbed the comfort of the surrounding customers. That's when I realized that it was right to ban smoking in restaurants and eateries. If there are no such laws and regulations, there will not be a safe environment in the service centers and it will be difficult for the people who serve them. Therefore, it is right to ban smoking in all restaurants in the country.
