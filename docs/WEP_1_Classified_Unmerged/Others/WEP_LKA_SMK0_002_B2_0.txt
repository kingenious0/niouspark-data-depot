"With the rise of information regarding the negative effects of passive smoking, I believe that the government should take a stand and ban smoking at restaurants. 
Studies have shown that while smoking is carcinogenic, and can cause various other lung related diseases and problems, passive smoking is more likely to cause lung cancer. The irritation caused by inhaling cigarette smoke can leave long lasting damage to one's health. Such harmful chemicals and substances should not be allowed under any circumstances to be inhaled by children and pregnant women. 
Specifically at restaurants, cigarette smoke leaves a lingering smell that is very unpleasant. This can ruin a customer's experience, as smell is strongly associated with taste in the human brain. This can cause the meal to be distasteful. This can cause a loss for the restaurant as customers leave with a negative impression.
Coughing caused by irritation, can cause harmful bacteria to be released into the air, where it can spread to other customers via the air, water and food. This can lead to wild spread of diseases. 
Therefore, due to the dangers of cigarette smoke and the unpleasant experience caused by it, I believe that smoking must be banned from all restaurants."
