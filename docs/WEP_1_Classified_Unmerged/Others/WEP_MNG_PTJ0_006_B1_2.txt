 Working while studying for sure has its pros and cons. It seems like back in the day most people focused mainly on the cons, leading to see the whole concept in unpleasant ways. However, as time changes, their opinion on this matter is becoming different. I think having a half-time job as a student has a lot of benefits such as earning extra money and making new friends
First of all, the salary earned from working part-time jobs can help support student's life. In a world where money means everything, gaining some extra is surely helpful for a lot of different ways. Even if the total amount of the earnings may not be able to cover all the living expenses, students can use the money to contribute to their interest or to improve themselves in various sites.
Secondly, having to spend time in a different environment while working means meeting new people. The time spent during college is not all about focusing on academics, but about having fun and experimenting with new adventures with new friends/people. Also, expanding their social circles can help people in different ways, even in their future careers. 
To conclude, having a part-time job while studying is significant, considering the advantages of such as making money and getting to know different people.
