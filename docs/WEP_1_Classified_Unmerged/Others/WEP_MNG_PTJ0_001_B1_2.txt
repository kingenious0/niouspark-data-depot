     Yes. I agree. I come from the countryside to study in Ulaanbaatar, and I am a 4th year student. I live with my parents and 2 younger sisters and 2 younger brothers. For me, tuition fees, textbooks, accommodation in the city, food, daily allowance etc. are very expensive. All these expenses are paid by my parents. Last year, my family had 2 university students, so the expenses also increased, and the financial burden on parents increased. Being an adult, I didn't want to always take money from my parents. Therefore, I work during the rest of the school hours and during the summer holidays. Since I started working part-time, there have been many positive changes, I earn my own money, and it's nice to learn something new and make new many known by working. But how do you find a part-time job? a question will appear. I study at the Medical National University of Sciences, and the Department of Student Development Management of my school signs contracts with labor exchanges to support the work of students. In this way, by connecting students who want to work part-time with official organizations, students have the opportunity to do their favorite job reliably. In my case, I did research work and waiter through the Student Labor Support Center of the Student Development Administration. I think it is important to have a part-time job because there are many positive results from the work of university students.
