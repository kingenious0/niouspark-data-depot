I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Because I was working as a part-timer since I was first year student in university. It has a lot of opportunity beside earning a money for tuition fee also it was help me to pay  outside expenses such as transportation, lunch, books even for my hobby. One thing I learned when I was working in a hotel as a server is to communicate with a people who have different attitudes and behaviour. I learned how to treat them as they want, I started to forecasting different situations, even sometimes I knew someone has a bad day and wanted to order cup of hot coffee then I knew it and recommend it. Few such events later I realize that customers who I treated like this came back to our restaurant. Also another benefit working there is to learn how to handle things I don't know. It pushed me to learn something new in a brief time which means my coping skill has raised. Thus I strongly agree that no matter what kind of job  student do, they are going to learn something new in life and that knowledge going to be used in the future when it is necessary.
